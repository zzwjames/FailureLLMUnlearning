["Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has asked for forgiveness from the families of the 57 victims of this week's train crash.\n\nIn a Facebook message, Mr Mitsotakis said that \"in the Greece of 2023... two trains heading in different directions cannot run on the same line and no-one notice\".\n\nClashes with police were reported on Sunday as thousands joined a demonstration in the capital Athens.\n\nThey said seven officers were hurt and five arrests were made, the AFP news agency reports.\n\nSome demonstrators set fire to rubbish bins and threw petrol bombs. Police responded by firing tear gas and stun grenades, clearing the central Syntagma Square of the protesters within a few minutes.\n\nThe protesters also reportedly released hundreds of black balloons into the sky in memory of the dead, with some holding signs reading \"Down with killer governments\".\n\nOn the night of 28 February, a passenger train and a freight train that were travelling in opposite directions ended up on the same track.\n\nThe first four carriages of the passenger train were derailed, and the first two caught fire and were almost completely destroyed.\n\nThe train crash has been widely attributed to human error.\n\nA 59-year-old station master in Larissa, who was charged with manslaughter by negligence, appeared in court on Sunday and has been taken into custody.\n\nHis lawyer Stefanos Pantzartzidis said the station master had admitted to having a share of responsibility in the accident. He faces between 10 years and life in jail if convicted.\n\nBut many in Greece see the crash as an accident that had been waiting to happen, and the railway workers' union blamed successive governments' \"disrespect\" towards Greek railways for leading to this \"tragic result\".\n\nA government minister told the BBC that the lack of funding was the direct result of the strict terms of international bailouts imposed after the 2010 debt crisis.\n\nThe scene of the crash near Larissa\n\nUnion members were joined by residents of Athens and Thessaloniki in taking to the streets throughout the past week, shocked by the scale of the disaster. The protests were also attended by many students - several of the passengers on board one of the trains were students in their 20s returning to Thessaloniki after a long weekend celebrating Greek Orthodox Lent.\n\n\"The rail network looked problematic, with worn down, badly paid staff,\" Nikos Savva, a medical student from Cyprus, told AFP news agency.\n\nTrain drivers in Greece have said there have been long-running problems with the electronic systems that are supposed to warn them of danger ahead.\n\nThe transport minister, Kostas Karamanlis, also resigned as a \"sign of respect\" for the people who had died. Mr Karamanlis he was taking responsibility for the government's failure to modernise the country's railways in the three-and-a-half years it had been in power.\n\nImmediately after the accident, the Greek government declared three days of national mourning and said the cost of the victims' funerals would be paid for from the public purse.\n\nBBC Europe correspondent Nick Beake says the crash seems to be becoming a defining political issue for Greece as it prepares to face a general election in the spring.\n\nMedia reports have given 9 April as a possible date, but analysts say that date may now be pushed back.", "DUP Leader says his party is happy to be involved in talks with all political parties\n\nDUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has said he is hopeful of progress in the next few weeks in his talks with the government about restoring Stormont.\n\nHe was speaking after parties met the head of the civil service Jayne Brady.\n\nSir Jeffrey said discussions have reached an \"important stage\".\n\nHe added what happens then will determine of the government will be able to meet his party's demands on the protocol and \"be able to deliver what is required\" to restore the Executive.\n\nHe said his party's priority remained getting the solutions it needed on the Northern Ireland protocol which he said was continuing to cause harm.\n\nThe DUP collapsed power-sharing in February 2022 in protest against post-Brexit trading arrangements.\n\nHe added that his party was happy to be involved in conversations around how to ease the budgetary pressures \"if and when\" the Executive was restored.\n\nSinn F\u00e9in's Conor Murphy says there was \"consensus\" within the Stormont parties that they need support with the ongoing financial pressures.\n\nSinn F\u00e9in's Conor Murphy says there is an elephant in the room around the DUP getting back to work\n\nBut Mr Murphy questioned \"the elephant in the room\" around when the DUP would get back to work.\n\nHe said: \"We are doing preparation work for negotiations that might not happen.\"\n\nHe added that the financial situation in regards to public funding was getting worse not better.\n\nThis is the first hint of a timeline in the DUP's talks with the government.\n\nAccording to the party leader we are reaching an \"important stage\" in the next few weeks and he is hopeful of progress.\n\nThat will coincide with a meeting of the UK and Irish governments in London hosted by Secretary of State Chris Heaton-Harris.\n\nCould that be the moment when the government sets out its legislative plan to deal with the DUPs protocol concerns?\n\nThe government will be keen to pass any legislation before Westminster breaks for the summer recess on 20 July.\n\nBut don't expect a quick decision from the DUP.\n\nThe party may want assurances around a financial package to help plug Stormont's \u00a31.1bn black hole.\n\nThey may also decide to reserve judgement until the new arrangements agreed in Windsor Framework are put into operation in October.\n\nUUP leader Doug Beattie says the pace of executive restoration is ramping up\n\nUlster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie said the pace towards the return of a Stormont executive is being \"ramped up\".\n\nHe said the all-party talks with the head of the civil service were positive.\n\nMr Beattie said those around the table talked about \"when\" the Executive is restored.\n\nHe said talks focused on the financial ask of the treasury to plug the \u00a31.1bn black hole in Stormont's finances.\n\nAlliance MP Stephen Farry says serious work is being done to move forward\n\nAlliance MP Stephen Farry said that the talks and the progress being made should not be seen as a barrier to getting the Executive back up and running again.\n\nBut he added the talks on Thursday were a positive sign and that \"serious work\" was being done to put together a plan from the parties for the UK government on moving forward.\n\nMr Farry said: \"There is some degree of momentum building in this process but it's still early days.\"\n\nSir Jeffrey also criticised Sinn F\u00e9in MP John Finucane over his planned attendance at an IRA commemoration at the weekend in Armagh.\n\nHe said his \"attendance was wrong on so many levels\".\n\nHe added they were \"building a fun day around celebrating volunteers who were one of the most feared killing machines in Northern Ireland during the troubles\"\n\nHe urged Sinn F\u00e9in to think again about its involvement this weekend and to think of the impact on the victims families who still carry the hurt and pain.\n\nSinn F\u00e9in has previously said that \"everyone has the right to remember their dead\".", "This year's Glastonbury festival is off to a rocking start as thousands of festival-goers party

homosexuality is wrong in relationships and sex education (RSE).\n\nA Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission (NIHRC) report said \"many schools use language that shames and stigmatises young people\" who had sex.\n\nSome told pupils that those who \"engage in casual sex must bear the consequences of their actions\".\n\nThe NIHRC investigated schools policies on the teaching of RSE.\n\nThe detailed investigation found most schools were not providing \"age-appropriate, comprehensive and scientifically accurate education on access to abortion services\".\n\n\"Some schools actively contributed to the shame and stigma surrounding unplanned pregnancy and abortion, by making statements such as 'abortion is not a means of contraception and those who knowingly engage in casual sex must bear the consequences of their actions',\" the NIHRC report said.\n\nIt also said about two-thirds of post-primaries promoted abstinence in their sex education policies.\n\nOne school's policy stated that \"sexual abstinence before marriage and fidelity within it, will be presented as the positive and desirable option and an achievable reality\".\n\nThe commission recommended that schools should be monitored to ensure sex education is taught in \"an objective and non-judgemental manner\".\n\nThat should include \"detailed assessments of the content and delivery of lesson plans\".\n\nThe NIHRC was established following the Good Friday Agreement.\n\nIt has the power to conduct investigations and compel evidence.\n\nIts investigation into relationships and sex education focused mainly on legal and policy matters but it also made recommendations on delivery of the subject in schools.\n\nAbout three-quarters (149) of post-primaries in Northern Ireland provided evidence to the commission's investigation and 124 provided their RSE policies.\n\nSome schools provided lesson plans and teaching notes, and experts were also consulted by the commission.\n\nSpeaking about the findings, NIHRC chief commissioner, Alyson Kilpatrick told Good Morning Ulster that \"an awful lot more needed to be done by a majority of schools in relation to age appropriate, comprehensive, scientifically accurate education and sexual reproductive health and rights\".\n\n\"The Department for Education needs to work with schools, consult with parents and children, to work out what the appropriate content should be and that it is delivered properly,\" said Ms Kilpatrick.\n\nIn 2018, the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) said RSE in Northern Ireland should be compulsory and comprehensive.\n\nAs a result, the Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris recently laid new regulations in parliament making teaching topics like abortion and prevention of pregnancy compulsory in schools in Northern Ireland.\n\nHe said he had a legal duty to act on the recommendations made in the CEDAW report.\n\nBut the change has been criticised by Protestant and Catholic church leaders.\n\nThe NIHRC investigation into RSE was carried out before Mr Heaton-Harris's move.\n\nBut the commission said that there must be monitoring to \"ensure that schools are meeting their new obligations\".\n\n\"It's very easy to have a policy or to have a list of things you are going to teach, but it is the actual teaching of them and the way in which they are taught which is so influential,\" said Ms Kilpatrick.\n\nAt present, each school in Northern Ireland has to teach sex education but can decide what to teach \"based on the ethos of their school,\" according to Department of Education (DE) guidance.\n\nThe NIHRC said that the majority of schools who submitted their RSE policy to the investigation \"still promoted the value of the 'sanctity of marriage'\", and related terms, such as \"permanent committed sexual relationship\", and \"married love\" in their RSE policies and school ethos.\n\n\"In addition to this idealisation and promotion of abstinence, marriage, and monogamy, many schools use language that shames and stigmatises young people who do engage in sexual practices,\" the report continued.\n\n\"Most schools also contributed to this association of shame with sexual activity, by attributing specific moral values and personal characteristics to those who engaged (or did not engage) in sexual behaviour.\"\n\nThe NIHRC said about two-thirds of post-primaries taught pupils about contraception, but it was difficult to know if they offered accurate information.\n\nIn their RSE policies, some schools stated that \"they will present the Catholic teaching that 'the use of any artificial means of preventing procreation is not acceptable',\" the report said.\n\n\"Some schools even outline their beliefs that \"homosexuality\" is wrong,\" in their polices, the NIHRC said.\n\n\"For example, one [school] writes that 'the belief that homosexual acts are against the nature and purpose of human relationships will be presented to pupils',\" the report continued.\n\nOne third of schools who provided information to the NIHRC said their school would teach pupils that \"heterosexual relationships was the 'main' or 'ideal' context for sexual intimacy\".\n\nThe report also said most schools \"indirectly contribute to the societal victim-blaming and slut-shaming of women and girls.\"\n\nIt said this was because they focused on how young people could stop themselves becoming victims of sexual abuse or violence, rather than challenging the perpetrators.\n\nThe NIHRC said that while their investigation showed some schools provided \"comprehensive and scientifically accurate\" relationship and sex education, the majority in Northern Ireland did not.\n\nThe commission concluded that the case for reforming the RSE curriculum was \"compelling\".\n\nIt provided 13 recommended reforms, including schools involving their students in drawing up RSE policies.", "This year's Glastonbury festival is

Her family described her as \"amazing\" and an \"inspiration\".\n\nThey announced her death in a post on her Instagram page. \"We are deeply saddened to announce the death of Dame Deborah James; the most amazing wife, daughter, sister, mummy,\" it said.\n\nShe passed away peacefully surrounded by her family.\n\nHer family said Dame Deborah shared her experience of cancer to \"raise awareness, break down barriers, challenge taboos and change the conversation around cancer\".\n\n\"Even in her most challenging moments, her determination to raise money and awareness was inspiring.\"\n\nDame Deborah was praised for her no-nonsense approach to talking about cancer, having shared her experiences of treatment and daily life since her diagnosis in 2016.\n\nA deputy head teacher, she started a cancer blog, before writing for the Sun and becoming a BBC broadcaster.\n\nBut on 9 May she announced that she was no longer receiving active care and did not know how long she had left.\n\n\"My body just can't continue any more,\" she said in a post on her @bowelbabe Instagram account.\n\nShe also launched a new fund, called the Bowelbabe fund, to raise money for research into personalised medicine for cancer patients.\n\nIt surpassed \u00a31m in less than 24 hours - smashing her initial goal of \u00a3250,000 - and has now raised almost \u00a37m.\n\nIn May, she was given a damehood by Prince William at her parents' home in Woking, Surrey, where she had chosen to stay.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge - who donated to the research fund - praised her \"tireless efforts\" and thanked her for \"giving hope\" to those living with the disease.\n\nFor her part, Dame Deborah said William's visit was \"surreal\".\n\n\"You can imagine the cleaning antics and preparation went off the scale - but it was all irrelevant because William was so kind,\" she said.\n\nThe money raised through her Bowelbabe fund will support Cancer Research UK, Bowel Cancer UK and the Royal Marsden Hospital - a specialist cancer treatment facility.\n\nBowel Cancer UK, of which Dame Deborah was a patron, said she had turned her bowel cancer diagnosis \"into an incredible force for good\" and would save countless lives through her campaigning.\n\nGenevieve Edwards, chief executive of Bowel Cancer UK, said the former teacher had an \"incredible energy\" and a \"marvellous knack of making things happen\".\n\nPaying tribute to the presenter's awareness-raising work, Ms Edwards said: \"She had this incredible power to connect with people. She leaves a tremendous legacy behind her\".\n\nDame Deborah campaigned to raise awareness about bowel cancer, urging people to check for symptoms, during and after her treatment.\n\nFollowing one operation, while in an anaesthetic daze, she ordered a poo costume online - which she would wear while recording her podcast.\n\nSigning off her final podcast in May, she said: \"Check your poo. Come on. I can't leave on any other word apart from check your poo.\n\n\"I still have images of me dancing in poo outfits everywhere. So maybe I should leave on that final word. Check your poo.\"\n\nRegular bowel cancer screening is available to everyone aged 60-74 and this programme is expanding to include everyone aged 50-59. This expansion is happening gradually over four years and started in April last year.\n\nPeople in England aged 60-74 who are registered with a GP are automatically sent an NHS bowel cancer screening kit every two years.\n\nIf you are outside this age group, you should still be aware of what bowel cancer symptoms are and visit your GP if you have any concerns.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson described her as \"an inspiration to so many\", while Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said her charity work was \"truly inspirational... even in the most challenging moments\".\n\nThe director general of the BBC, Tim Davie said she was a \"true inspiration\" and the way she talked about cancer \"moved the nation, inspired change and undoubtedly saved lives\".\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: Deborah James \"can't really do anything more\" to fight cancer\n\nDame Deborah co-hosted You, Me and the Big C with Rachael Bland and Lauren Mahon\n\nDame Deborah began co-presenting You, Me and the Big C alongside Lauren Mahon and BBC Radio 5 Live newsreader Rachael Bland in 2018, with the show earning praise for its frank discussion of cancer.\n\nThey spoke to celebrity guests and addressed practical matters, including hair loss, tips for dealing with finances and telling your nearest and dearest about illnesses.\n\nBland died aged 40 in September 2018, two years after being diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\nBBC 5 Live presenter Tony Livesey, who was a friend of Dame Deborah and did her final broadcast interview earlier this month, said the campaigner was \"one of the most remarkable women I've ever met\".\n\n\"All the fame she's had was a by-product of just the work she wanted to do to save one life,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\nBBC News presenter George Alagiah, who is living with bowel cancer, recalled speaking to Dame Deborah at the Royal Marsden Hospital.\n\nMr Alagiah told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme the campaigner answered his questions about the symptoms he might experience with the illness.\n\nThe newsreader said he was struck by Dame Deborah's \"sheer generosity\" and that their chat was \"typical of what I now know she was capable of doing and did for so many others\".\n\nSpeaking on BBC Breakfast, Lucie Kon, a BBC producer and friend of Dame Deborah, called the podcast host \"the most amazing human out of anyone I know\" and said she would be \"alive in my mind forever\".\n\nLucie said Dame Deborah showed that cancer does not have to be a \"life sentence\", and that the 40-year-old \"didn't want to be a victim\".\n\nDame Deborah's first book, called F*** You Cancer: How to face the big C, live your life and still be yourself, was published in 2018.\n\nHer second book, How To Live When You Could Be Dead, is due to be released on 18 August.\n\nThis Instagram post cannot be displayed in your browser.

and added that he had dropped off his daughter \"five minutes before\".\n\n\"You will not intimidate anyone,\" he warned those behind the attack. \"Thanks to everyone who prayed, because it should have been impossible to survive such an explosion,\" he added.\n\nThe prize-winning author and veteran of Moscow's bloody wars in Chechnya is one of Russia's most celebrated writers, and before 2014 was a vocal critic of President Vladimir Putin.\n\nBut in recent years Prilepin - long known for his involvement in Russian ultranationalist politics - has seemingly reconciled with Mr Putin and become a strident supporter of the Ukraine invasion.\n\nThe 47-year-old has admitted fighting alongside pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine and has called for the \"return of Kyiv to Russia\".\n\nLast year a group founded by Prilepin called on officials to \"purge the cultural space\" of all who oppose the conflict.\n\nRussia's Investigative Committee (SK), which handles serious crimes including terrorism, accuses Alexander Permyakov of having detonated a remote-controlled bomb, wrecking Prilepin's Audi.\n\nThe bomb was allegedly planted on the road and detonated remotely\n\nThe SK says he was caught in a neighbouring village. The region is more than 425km (265 miles) east of Moscow.\n\nHe \"admitted doing an assignment for the Ukrainian secret services\", the SK alleges.\n\nThe partisan group Atesh, which is made up of Ukrainians and Crimean Tartars, claimed it was behind the attack on Prilepin.\n\n\"We had a feeling that sooner or later he would be blown up,\" they wrote on Telegram. \"He was not driving alone, but with a surprise on the underside of the car.\"\n\nUkraine's security service (SBU) issued its standard response, declining to comment on the attack or to a Russian foreign ministry allegation that Ukraine - backed by the US government - targeted Prilepin.\n\nThe attack is the latest to target high-profile supporters of President Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.\n\nVladlen Tatarsky was killed last month.

Oh, and it is raining. It can only mean one thing - the 2024 County Championship campaign begins on Friday.\n\nBazball might have lost a little of its buzz but some of its biggest names will feature in the early stages of the season.\n\nBBC Sport takes a look at who will be involved and some other things to look out for this year.\n\nSurrey looking for three in a row\n\nNot accounting for the Covid-hit seasons of 2020 and 2021, last season was effectively Surrey's third Championship title win from the last four, having also won it in 2018.\n\nTheir squad is largely the same as last season, with England batter Dan Lawrence a notable addition, arriving from Essex. Overseas stars Sean Abbott and Kemar Roach will return to the Oval though all-rounder Aaron Hardie's planned stint has been called off by Cricket Australia.\n\nSurrey director of cricket Alec Stewart, who is leaving the role at the end of the campaign, says they are hungry for more success.\n\n\"Last March I said 'we want to attack this year not defend it',\" he told BBC Radio London.\n\n\"My dad [Surrey great Mickey Stewart] still goes on about being part of the team that won it seven times on the trot. We have now won it back-to-back. And adding Dan Lawrence gives us another top-class player, and more appetite to win it again.\"\n\nHead coach Gareth Batty said the club's mentality \"has to be about winning things\" and they do not want to stop at one trophy.\n\n\"Knowing Alec isn't going to be around in a full-time capacity next year - for those that are driven by the emotional side it's a lovely add-on, for those who aren't it doesn't matter, it's still going to be winning - this group is driven for success,\" Batty said.\n\nSounds ominous for the rest, so who can stop them?\n\nEssex hung around longer than anyone last season and took the title race to the final round, though they finished 20 points adrift in second place.\n\nOne veteran Test opener has replaced another at Chelmsford with South Africa's Dean Elgar signed to fill the big shoes of the retiring Sir Alastair Cook. There's also an eye on the future as all-action keeper/batter Jordan Cox has been tempted over the Thames from Kent.\n\nThe loss of Lawrence will certainly sting, but there are a host of talented young batters waiting in the wings and any side who can toss the ball to Jamie Porter, Sam Cook or Simon Harmer will fancy their chances.\n\nEssex were only denied victory over Surrey by the weather last season and this campaign, for the first time in five years, the two will face each other home and away. The final game of the season sees them face-off at Chelmsford.\n\nLancashire took a step backwards in 2023 after finishing as runners-up in all three competitions the previous year.\n\nIn a winter of change behind the scenes, head coach Glen Chapple has been replaced by Dale Benkenstein.\n\nThe county have pulled off a coup with the arrival of Australia spinner Nathan Lyon for the first half of the campaign. Plenty of talk has been about how they pair him with Tom Hartley, fresh from a 22-wicket haul in England's Test series in India.\n\nHampshire have quietly gone about their business after a pair of third-placed finishes. They have added promising Sussex top-order batter Ali Orr and Australia paceman Michael Neser.\n\nWill that be enough to end a 52-year wait for the title? James Vince, Liam Dawson, Mohammad Abbas, Keith Barker and Kyle Abbott are not getting any younger, but they did beat Essex and Surrey to finish the 2023 campaign.\n\nDurham's last game in Division One came against Hampshire in 2016 before they were relegated by the ECB at the end of the season, giving Hampshire a reprieve. They make a triumphant return to the top flight with a game against... Hampshire.\n\nThey have plenty of quality in the pace bowling department. Australia's Scott Boland has signed an overseas deal until the end of July and they already have Ben Raine and Matthew Potts, who bagged 50 wickets apiece last year.\n\nSouth Africa batter David Bedingham returns for a full summer, while England skipper Ben Stokes also hopes to be involved at the start of the season.\n\nWorcestershire have seen New Road flooded seven times across the winter and their two home games in their opening six fixtures will be played at Kidderminster - with talk of them potentially leaving the ground permanently.\n\nWhile they have added West Indies all-rounder Jason Holder and Nathan Smith of New Zealand, in addition to Rob Jones from Lancashire and Northants duo Josh Cobb and Tom Taylor, their quest to avoid an immediate return to Division Two has not been helped by bowlers Dillon Pennington and Josh Tongue, and batter Jack Haynes, all moving to Notts.\n\nNottinghamshire will be skippered by Haseeb Hameed, taking over from Steven Mullaney, in what feels like a new era at Trent Bridge with Samit Patel, Jake Ball and Stuart Broad all departing.\n\nThere has been another change of captain at Somerset where Lewis Gregory succeeds Tom Abell, and though Ball arrives from Notts, one player who will not be at Taunton this summer is Aussie all-rounder Will Sutherland, who has pulled out of his stint through injury.\n\nSomerset have famously never won the title and went five without a win to start last season.

Associated Newspapers (ANL) wants to end the claims without trial.\n\nDavid Sherborne, the lawyer for the group of prominent individuals, said: \"The claimants each claim that in different ways they were the victim of numerous unlawful acts carried out by the defendant, or by those acting on the instructions of its newspapers, the Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday.\"\n\nHe said the alleged unlawful activity included \"illegally intercepting voicemail messages; listening into live landline calls; obtaining private information, such as itemised phone bills or medical records, by deception or 'blagging'\".\n\nThe activity also allegedly included \"using private investigators to commit these unlawful information gathering acts on their behalf and even commissioning the breaking and entry into private property\".\n\nHe added: \"They range through a period from 1993 to 2011, even continuing beyond until 2018.\"\n\nActress Sadie Frost also appeared on Monday, and sat two seats away from Harry in the courtroom\n\nIn a document filed on Prince Harry's behalf, Mr Sherborne said the duke was \"troubled that, through Associated's unlawful acts, he was largely deprived of important aspects of his teenage years\".\n\nIn particular, he said, the prince had \"suspicion and paranoia\" caused by the publication of articles by ANL using unlawfully gathered information.\n\nThe barrister said: \"Friends were lost or cut off as a result and everyone became a 'suspect' since he was misled by the way that the articles were written into believing that those close to him were the source of this information being provided to Associated's newspapers.\"\n\nHe added: \"The claimant regards Associated's unlawful acts to amount to a major betrayal given promises made by the media to improve its conduct following the tragic and untimely death of his mother, Princess Diana, in 1997.\"\n\nSir Elton's lawyer said the singer and his husband were \"appalled\" by ANL's alleged conduct\n\nThe High Court was told Sir Elton and Mr Furnish's landline at their home in Windsor was tapped by a private investigator on the instructions of Associated Newspapers Limited.\n\nMr Sherborne said they were \"mortified to consider all their conversations, some of which were very personal indeed, were tapped, taped, packaged and consumed as a commercial product for journalists and unknown others to pick over regardless of whether or not they were published\".\n\nThe High Court heard Sir Elton and Mr Furnish had not seen a copy of their first child's birth certificate before it was unlawfully obtained by ANL.\n\nBaroness Doreen Lawrence, whose son Stephen was murdered in a racist attack, also attended court on Monday\n\nMr Sherborne also told the court a private investigator acting on behalf of ANL hacked Hurley's phone and placed a \"sticky window mini-microphone\" outside her home.\n\nHe added her ex-boyfriend Hugh Grant's car was bugged to unlawfully obtain information about her finances, travel plans and medicals during her pregnancy.\n\nHe also told the court ANL paid a private investigator to unlawfully find the address of a man it believed was the male lover of Liberal Democrat politician Sir Simon Hughes.\n\nBaroness Lawrence's bank accounts were monitored to check whether she was receiving any money from other newspapers during the Daily Mail's Justice for Stephen Lawrence Campaign, Mr Sherborne alleged.\n\n\"She finds it hard to believe the level of duplicity and manipulation that was clearly at play, knowing now as she does that the Daily Mail's outward support for her fight to bring Stephen's killers to justice was hollow and, worse, entirely false,\" he said.\n\nANL has said it categorically denies the serious claims made in the litigation and will vigorously defend them if necessary.\n\nThe group launched the legal action last year. ANL's lawyer Adrian Beltrami KC said, in written submissions, that the legal actions had been brought too late, were \"stale\" and the claims were \"largely inferential\".\n\nThe barrister said the individuals had to prove they did not know earlier, or could not have discovered earlier, they might have had a claim against ANL for alleged misuse of their private information.\n\nHe said none of the group said they believe they continued to be targeted by unlawful information-gathering after 2015.\n\nIn a statement after Monday's hearing, it added: \"A private investigator whose 'confessions' form a key element of a privacy case being brought against Associated Newspapers by Prince Harry, Baroness Doreen Lawrence, Elton John and others has denied their allegations that he acted illegally against them on behalf of the Daily Mail or Mail on Sunday.\"\n\nIt said while the Mail's \"admiration of Baroness Lawrence remained undimmed\", we are \"profoundly saddened that she has been persuaded to bring this case\".\n\nIt added: \"The Mail remains hugely proud of its pivotal role in campaigning for justice for Stephen Lawrence.

She later also admitted that she stabbed the woman after she was dead.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nVan Houten's lawyer, Nancy Tetreault, told the BBC that she left a women's prison in California early on Tuesday morning and was likely to be on parole for three years.\n\n\"She had a long job of detaching herself from the cult mentality and accepting responsibility for her crimes\" Ms Tetreault said. \"It took her a long time. She had decades of therapy. So she felt guilt and deep remorse.\"\n\nCharles Manson, considered one of America's most notorious cult leaders, directed his followers to commit nine murders and hoped the killings would start a race war, called \"Helter Skelter\" after a famous song by the Beatles. He died in prison in 2017.\n\nFollowing her life sentence, Van Houten earned both a bachelors and masters degree while in prison, where she also worked as a tutor for other inmates.\n\nAfter being denied parole dozens of times during her incarceration, Van Houten was finally recommended for parole in 2016. But the recommendations were rejected by California Governor Gavin Newsom and his predecessor, Jerry Brown.\n\nThe last time she was blocked from parole, in 2020, was ultimately overruled by a California appeals court.\n\nOn 8 July, however, Mr Newsom said that he would not block her parole this time, paving the way for her release on Tuesday.\n\nIn a statement last week, the governor said he remained disappointed at her release, which he said was unlikely to be heard by California's Supreme Court if the legal battle continued.\n\n\"More than 50 years after the Manson cult committed these brutal killings, the victims' families still feel the impact,\" the statement said.\n\nLeslie Van Houten (right) was the youngest Manson follower to be convicted of murder for her role in the death of Leno LaBianca\n\nNow out of prison, Van Houten is expected to spend about a year at a halfway house, where her lawyer said she would need to learn to navigate a reality much different to when she first was put behind bars.\n\n\"She has to learn to use the internet. She has to learn to buy things without cash,\" Ms Tetreault told the AP. \"It's a very different world than when she went in.\"\n\nIn repeated parole hearings, Van Houten expressed regret for her role in the killings and involvement with Manson, later acknowledging that she had let him overpower her \"individual thinking\".\n\n\"I bought into it lock, stock and barrel,\" she said of his beliefs in a 2002 parole hearing. \"I took it at face value\".", "Malcolm Myers says 10-year-old rescue dog Buddy is his hero\n\nA man who was trapped under a fallen tree branch has said his life was saved by his dog.\n\nMalcolm Myers, from Thirsk, was walking his rescue dog Buddy on a footpath when he heard a loud crack.\n\nA branch from a horse chestnut tree hit him on the back and head, burying him - but he said Buddy dug away the foliage to help free him.\n\nNorth Yorkshire Council said it had contacted the landowner and had launched an investigation.\n\nMr Myers, 63, was walking on a path near Thirsk and Sowerby Institute on 7 June at around 13:45 BST when he said he heard a sound like a \"clap of thunder\".\n\n\"I was buried with a tree that had fallen on top of me, I was trapped, I couldn't move,\" he said.\n\n\"There was a branch around my leg.

These are all the basics of policing.\n\n\"We've seen too many occasions where opportunities are being missed to catch offenders who are causing misery in our communities.\"\n\nMr Cooke says the police are often \"picking up the slack\" for other parts of public services.\n\n\"Mental health is a great example,\" he said. \"Last year policing attended 600,000 mental health incidents. Most of those incidents there was no requirement for police to attend.\"\n\nMetropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley wrote to health and social care services in Greater London in May, informing them the service would stop attending mental health incidents from September, except where there is an \"immediate threat to life\".\n\nHumberside Police introduced the Right Care, Right Person scheme in 2020 to ensure mental health calls are dealt with by relevant professionals.\n\nMr Cooke welcomed investment that had seen more than 20,000 police officers added in England and Wales since 2020.\n\nHowever, he noted difficulties in vetting new recruits and the inexperience of a workforce which lost many established officers during David Cameron's time as prime minister.\n\nFurthermore, where failings have been identified, some forces have been too slow to implement improvements, he said.\n\nMr Cooke called on Home Secretary Suella Braverman to grant new enforcement powers to enforce compliance with the Inspectorate of Constabulary's recommendations by the end of this year.\n\nForces had taken too long to respond to recommendations in the 2016 State of Policing report relating to officers abusing their positions for sexual purposes, he said.\n\n\"Two forces did from the start what they should have done,\" Mr Cooke said. \"That should have been 43 forces.\n\n\"In those seven years, we have seen some truly horrendous acts by officers.\n\n\"The chances of these things happening would have been lessened had we had those powers at an earlier time.\n\n\"It would ensure police chiefs across the country would have to make the changes that are required to keep the public safe.\"\n\nLabour shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper called the report \"truly damning\" and backed major reforms. She blamed successive Conservative home secretaries for a series of failings.\n\n\"These include systemic failings in policing and a totally dysfunctional criminal justice system, with more criminals getting away with crimes, victims let down, vital neighbourhood policing devastated, record numbers of forces in special measures, and confidence in policing falling,\" she said.\n\nMs Braverman said the report acknowledged a fall in crime rates but conceded \"there is lots more to do\".\n\nShe added: \"This is why I've been calling for common-sense policing. With the highest number of police officers than ever before, the police must deliver for victims.\n\n\"It has always been my priority to reduce burdens on policing and ensure they have the resources they need.\"\n\nBaroness Louise Casey, who authored a damning report on the Met earlier this year, told the BBC's Political Thinking podcast that for people to consent to policing, officers need to be seen as \"beyond reproach\" on issues like violence against women.\n\nShe said: \"The thing I still feel is fairly unforgivable is that misconduct in a police officer is totally undermining of the fact that they can arrest me, they can cuff me, they can strip search me, they can literally take my clothes off and strip search me.\n\n\"They can put me in a police cell for 24 hours, all on the basis of that officer's word.\"\n\nHave you been a victim of crime?

Improving retention through better working conditions, professional midwifery issues and the wellbeing of staff are also a key component of this.\n\n\"Most importantly, it was also about our members standing tall and being prepared to take action to ensure better care for women, babies, and their families.\"\n\nThe Scottish government said it had committed an extra \u00a3568m to the 2023/24 offer to 160,000 NHS Scotland workers on Agenda for Change contracts - who includes nurses, paramedics, midwives and porters.\n\nStaff up to Band 8a would see an uplift of at least 6.5%.\n\nIn addition, all staff would receive a one-off payment between \u00a3387 and \u00a3939 depending on banding.\n\nNurses protest during a strike by NHS medical workers outside University College London Hospital in London\n\nMeanwhile, in England a 5% pay rise from April has been offered to NHS staff including nurses and ambulance workers.\n\nIn addition, staff have been offered a one-off payment of at least \u00a31,655 to top up the past year's pay award.\n\nUnions are recommending members back the deal, after nearly two weeks of talks with ministers, raising hopes the bitter dispute may be coming to an end.\n\nThe offer covers all NHS staff except doctors, who are on a different contract.\n\nIt comes after a winter of industrial action, with nurses, ambulance staff and physios all striking.\n\nThe unions put further action on hold, after the two sides agreed to discussions last month.", "Jason, six-months old, is currently up for adoption at All Dogs Matter\n\nIllegal imports of puppies have continued to thrive following the pandemic, a study into UK purchasing practices suggests.\n\nThe Royal Veterinary College says the rise means dogs are at risk of being exposed to infectious diseases and a \"very impoverished environment\".\n\nThe report highlights other irresponsible practices from breeders such as only offering online viewings.\n\nThe government said buyers must go to a reputable seller or rehoming centre.\n\nThe rise in puppy smuggling came amid a surge in demand for puppies during the coronavirus lockdowns, with prices in some areas more than doubling to an average of almost \u00a31,900 each.\n\nIn a study published on Thursday in the journal Animals and shared with the BBC, the Royal Veterinary College (RVC) highlighted trends in puppy purchasing across the UK.\n\nDr Rowena Packer, first author of the study, said the rise in imported puppies was concerning.\n\nThe study estimates 10% of puppies purchased in 2021 were imported, more than double the figure from 2019.\n\nBabaloo's owner, Ms Papantoni, describes her as \"a very lovely, happy, energetic, kind, sensitive, and a bit of a naughty dog\"\n\nIn December 2020, Vasiliki Papantoni, in London, legally imported a puppy from Serbia after carefully planning the dog's journey to the UK.\n\nShe said the breeder had a \"good reference\" from a friend and provided lots of paperwork.\n\nMs Papantoni said she started her search for a puppy in the UK, but found that waiting lists were \"very long\".\n\nShe said a previous attempt to purchase a puppy in the UK ended in her being \"scammed\" when a breeder stopped contact after receiving a \u00a3300 deposit.\n\nDr Packer warns not all imported puppies receive good care when taken across Europe. \"These could be puppies that were transported for several days without appropriate provisions, rest, food, water,\" she said.\n\nThe RVC say puppies brought into the UK are \"often under the minimum legal age\" of 15 weeks, unlike Babaloo.\n\nThe organisation asked UK puppy purchasers the same questions over three years via an online survey. They analysed 1,148 responses from 2019, 4,369 from 2020 and 2,080 from 2021.\n\nDr Packer warns \"poor welfare sources\" also exist within the UK, such as \"a breeder or a dealer or somebody who produces puppies without due regard to their health and welfare\".\n\n\"You can very rapidly and cheaply rear a puppy if you don't care about some of those factors,\" she said.\n\nIntroduced in April 2020, 'Lucy's Law' requires puppies bred in England be shown with their mother and purchased from the place they were born.\n\nThe law does not apply to rescue and rehoming organisations, Defra said.\n\nDr Marc Abraham OBE, a vet, founded the campaign. He calls it a \"first step in combating irresponsible breeding and selling practices\".\n\nBut he adds it was overshadowed by the pandemic.\n\nIra Moss, founder of charity All Dogs Matter, says she knows of multiple puppy purchasers who were only shown pictures of the dog's parents, or were not allowed into the property where they were said to have been born.\n\nThe RVC's study estimates people purchasing puppies in 2021 \"were more likely to rely on online viewings, rather than in person, and to collect the puppy from outside the breeder's property\".\n\nIn 2019, only 7% of respondents viewed the puppy they purchased via a live video call. In 2021, the figure was 18%.\n\nThe pandemic restrictions still in effect for parts of 2021 may have factored into that year's figure.\n\nDr Abraham says the pandemic also led to a \"huge surge in demand\" for dogs, pushing up the price for a puppy and leading to more first time owners.\n\nHe adds: \"There's so many inexperienced dog owners around that I'm not not sure people did enough investment in how to look after a dog.\"\n\nIn turn, he warns this has led to a \"spike in dogs being abandoned\".\n\nIn October 2022, RSPCA data showed the charity had seen a 25% rise in abandonment cases.\n\nAll Dogs Matter says the rescue sector now faces a \"rehoming crisis\". Ms Moss explains \"there are too many dogs, not enough spaces\".\n\nFurthermore, the cost of living crisis means \"charities are losing money with less donations coming in\".\n\nDr Abraham says \"rescue shelters have rules for a reason\".\n\n\"Please don't think\u2026if they say no, that you should then go online and have a puppy delivered,\" he added.\n\nA Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokesperson said: \"Buyers must do their research and ensure they go to a reputable seller or rehoming centre when looking for a pet.\n\n\"We are committed to delivering the Kept Animals Bill measures individually, including on puppy smuggling, during the remainder of this Parliament and look forward to progressing these. We will be setting out next steps in due course.\"", "Oil prices have risen after Saudi Arabia said it would make cuts of a million barrels per day (bpd) in July.\n\nOther members of Opec+, a group of oil-producing countries, also agreed to continued cuts in production in an attempt to shore up flagging prices.\n\nOpec+ accounts for around 40% of the world's crude oil and its decisions can have a major impact on oil prices.\n\nIn Asia trade on Monday, Brent crude oil rose by as much as 2.4% before settling at around $77 a barrel.\n\nOpec+ said production targets would drop by a further 1.4 million bpd from 2024.\n\nThe seven hour-long meeting on Sunday of the oil-rich nations came against a backdrop of falling energy prices.\n\nOil prices soared when Russia invaded Ukraine last year, but are now back at levels seen before the conflict began.\n\nIn October last year Opec+, a formulation which refers to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, agreed to cut production by two million bpd, about 2% of global demand.\n\nIn April this year the group agreed to a further cuts, which were due to last to the end of this year. But Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said that Sunday's talks led to \"the extension of the deal until the end of 2024\".\n\nOn Sunday, Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said that his country's cut of one million bpd could be extended beyond July if needed. \"This is a Saudi lollipop,\" he said, in what is seen as a bid to stabilise the market.\n\nBefore the two-day Opec+ meeting started, it was widely expected the oil cartel would make production cuts to prop up prices. It appears most members were against the idea, as any cuts would impact oil revenues, which are crucial to keep running their economies.\n\nSaudi Arabia's decision to make a voluntary reduction of one-million barrels per day was unexpected but does not come as a huge surprise. As the leader of the pack, and also the largest exporter of oil, it was the only one in a position to be able to lower output.\n\nFrom Riyadh's point of view, it is crucial the price of crude remains over $80 a barrel for it to break even. Saudi officials want elevated prices to keep spending billions of dollars on ambitious projects spearheaded by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as he tries to diversify the kingdom's economy away from oil.\n\nThe move by the Saudis also underlines the uncertain outlook for demand for fuels in the months to come. Concerns about the global economy, especially recessionary fears in the US and Europe are expected to put further pressure on crude prices.\n\nOil producers are grappling with falling prices and high market volatility amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe West has accused Opec of manipulating prices and undermining the global economy through high energy costs. It has also accused the group of siding with Russia despite sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn response, Opec insiders have said the West's monetary policy over the last decade has driven inflation and forced oil-producing nations to act to maintain the value of their main export.", "The crossing forms part of the Strathspey Railway\n\nSafety barriers have been installed at the last automatic open railway level crossing in Scotland.\n\nDalfaber Level Crossing in Aviemore was built in the early 1980s and is on a private line used by Strathspey Railway's steam locomotives.\n\nIt was an open crossing with warning signs and lights but no barriers before the new improvements were made.\n\nNew footways have also been constructed as part of the \u00a31.1m upgrade to improve safety at the site.\n\nThe crossing has been the scene of collisions and near misses involving cars and trains -

physically and mentally - as he showed glimpses of the form which has seen him long tipped to win one of the sport's four major titles.\n\nThere were tense moments in a tight first set where both players dominated on serve, Tsitsipas taking control of the tie-break to move ahead.\n\nThe second set followed a similar pattern.\n\nTsitsipas was edging the rallies as he continued to find range with his forehand, leaving Murray struggling to cope with his ferocious and consistent hitting from that side.\n\nBut, like he has done so often over the years, Murray continued to battle and managed to hold his service games with few issues as neither player conceded a break point.\n\nThat teed up another tie-break - and this time it was Murray who dominated it after finding his first serve when it mattered.\n\nMurray playing under the floodlights on Centre Court always creates a special atmosphere and the player, by now demanding more noise from the almost-capacity crowd, thrived on the energy.\n\nAfter not having a serious look at Tsitsipas's serve in the opening two sets, Murray broke to love right at the start of the third and maintained the momentum to move into the lead.\n\nHowever, there was a serious scare when he fell on the baseline.\n\nThe sound of his scream, along with the knowledge of his injury history, left the whole of Centre Court anxious and there was relief when he clambered to his feet before serving out.\n\nIt had long felt the end of the third set was the natural point to suspend the match and once that was agreed, Murray walked off to a thunderous ovation.\n\u2022 None Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone", "Thursday's blast damaged a number of buildings -

On the other, the then SDLP leader John Hume.\n\nThe man in between, holding their hands aloft like triumphant prize fighters, was the world's biggest rock star - Bono.\n\nThe Concert for Yes, which took place on 18 May 1998 in front of about 2,000 schoolchildren, achieved its aim.\n\nThree days later, Northern Ireland overwhelmingly endorsed the Good Friday Agreement in a referendum.\n\nTim Wheeler, lead singer of County Down band Ash, had a stage-side view of the historic moment - but his memories of the night are not quite so romantic.\n\nInstead, he remembers putting together songs on the fly and loaning guitars and equipment to the biggest band on the planet.\n\n\"U2 just flew in before the whole thing and they didn't bring any of their gear, they had to use all our gear,\" Wheeler told BBC News NI's The Sunday News.\n\nU2's The Edge on stage with Tim Wheeler, David Trimble, John Hume and Bono\n\nHe recalled how The Edge from U2 had borrowed a guitar belonging to Charlotte Hatherley, Ash's then lead guitarist.\n\n\"He was trying to figure out the controls. He was trying to get more of a louder kind of sound and he stepped on one of her pedals and it was too huge a jump - and he sort of jumped. It was pretty funny.\"\n\nThey may have been overshadowed by Bono et al, but it was Ash who did most of the on-stage heavy lifting on the night, delivering a 40-minute set and then performing a few hastily-arranged covers with U2.\n\nAt the time, the young Downpatrick band were riding an upsurge of rising hype and popularity - their debut album, 1977, was a critical and commercial success, buoyed by heavy radio rotations for singles such as Girl from Mars and Oh Yeah.\n\nCharlotte Hatherley, Rick McMurray and Tim Wheeler from Ash in 2002\n\nWheeler and co were in the studio recording the follow-up when they got the call - would they like to get involved in a concert campaigning for a yes vote?\n\n\"It all came about within a few days as far as I remember. I think it was just looking quite dicey whether the yes campaign would succeed.\n\n\"I think it was maybe U2's management got in touch with our management a few days before. We were in the a studio in London and they were like: 'Can you make it over to Belfast in three days time?'\n\n\"It was very important for us to be involved. I think U2 felt they needed a Northern Ireland band to make the concert really work - it was great.\"\n\nWheeler, who was 21 at the time, added with a laugh: \"U2 were a massive, worldwide, legendary band from the south and they needed some youngsters from the north - it was a really good pairing, I think.\"\n\nThe free concert for young people was envisioned as a last push to help get the yes vote over the line in the week of the referendum.\n\nMo Mowlam, Northern Ireland Secretary in 1998, at the referendum count\n\nWhile a huge turnout of Northern Ireland voters would comfortably vote the agreement through by 71% to 29%, the security of a \"yes\" vote was less certain beforehand.\n\nCatholics were expected to strongly support the agreement, but the deal needed cross-community backing and a solid majority to go ahead.\n\nAs the Washington Post reported at the time, David Trimble had his concerns.\n\n\"Over 70% we're safe.

He just pulled that out of thin air, no warning whatsoever.\n\n\"It's four very simple chords, we just started winging it and then he just looked at me and said: 'You sing the next verse'.\n\n\"I was like, I have no idea what the lyrics are at all, so I said 'you just do it'.\"\n\nDespite these understandable hiccups, the concert was a major success and, of course, produced that iconic image.\n\nTim Wheeler says Belfast was \"a very different place to grow up\"\n\nWheeler remembered \"a great feeling of positivity\" after the concert that resonated with a band whose three founding members had lived all their lives under the shadow of the Troubles.\n\n\"Coming to Belfast always felt very edgy. The Army was everywhere, of course, and always bomb threats and incidents in our town.\n\n\"I do remember I was up in Belfast and saw a policeman had just been shot and was being covered in a body bag.\n\n\"Being children you just get on with it and think it's normal.

However... I do not consider the evidence enables a positive finding as to how she died, or when and where this happened,\" Deputy State Coroner Elizabeth Ryan wrote.\n\nFor most, the Melissa Caddick story began with the news that the seemingly successful financial adviser was missing.\n\nBut her life had actually begun to unravel months earlier when Australia's financial watchdog was tipped off that she had been using a friend's financial adviser's licence, having simply pasted in her own name on the document.\n\nRegulators suspect the 49-year-old stole up to $30m (\u00a315.8m; $19.5m) from more than 60 clients, including many of her family and friends, to help fund a lavish lifestyle.\n\nThere were overseas trips on private jets, high-end cars, designer clothes, and expensive jewellery.\n\nHer methods were not \"particularly complicated\", the coroner said.\n\nAs new clients gave her money to invest, she would pay some out as dividends to existing clients before keeping - and spending - the rest.\n\nCoroner Ryan said she was struck by the \"powerful impression of wealth and success\" Caddick made on her clients and would-be investors.\n\n\"Equally significant was the trust they had in her... almost all were either immediate family members, or close personal friends of herself and her family,\" she said.\n\nOne would-be investor recalled: \"I wanted to model myself and our family on successful people, and Melissa appeared to be successful\".\n\nBut everything fell apart on 11 November 2020 when police knocked on her door at dawn.\n\nThe last confirmed sighting of Melissa Caddick was by officers at the raid on her home.\n\nHer husband, Anthony Koletti, told police they believed she had gone for an early run the next morning. Her car and all her personal belongings had been left behind.\n\nBut she was not reported missing by Mr Koletti for more than 30 hours, and only after he had dialled in to a court hearing that she was due to attend and appeared surprised she had not turned up.\n\nPolice initially explored two theories - that Caddick was still alive and had gone into hiding to escape justice, or had taken her own life.\n\nBut the inquest heard how Mr Koletti, a hairdresser and part-time DJ, behaved erratically in the wake of his wife's disappearance, leading police to suspect he could be involved.\n\nMr Koletti has denied any knowledge of his wife's crimes or any involvement in her disappearance, and police say they have uncovered no evidence to dispute that.\n\nAnthony Koletti has denied any knowledge of his wife's crimes\n\nBut an investigator told the coroner's court Mr Koletti \"didn't appear to be overly concerned\" when his wife vanished.\n\nLead Detective Sergeant Michael Kyneur also said Mr Koletti had visited a cliff top area near their home and taken a photograph of a shoe print, an action the policeman described as \"extraordinary\".\n\n\"That's a dog park. It's like saying I found a footprint on Bondi beach.\"\n\nThe inquest also heard that Mr Koletti had sent texts from Caddick's phone pretending to be her, told police he was \"too busy\" to attend an interview, and gave conflicting versions of events.\n\nFor example, he was able to provide a description of what his wife was wearing on the morning she vanished, despite also saying he had not actually seen her, police said.\n\nMr Koletti had also recounted his version of events by releasing a musical concept album containing tracks with titles such as \"Melissa Is Missing\" and \"Above the Law\".\n\nIt was \"regrettable\" that Mr Koletti had not given a \"full and frank\" account of what had happened, Magistrate Ryan said on Thursday.\n\nThe case took a grisly twist in February 2021 with the discovery of a rotting, trainer-clad foot on a remote beach 500km (310 miles) south of Sydney.\n\nExperts matched the body part to Caddick through DNA, but an autopsy couldn't determine if it was separated by force or decomposition.\n\nThe inquest heard a slew of theories to explain how it ended at Bournda Beach, including that a shark ate and later regurgitated body parts.\n\nPolice even considered throwing pig carcasses with running shoes on their trotters into the sea to determine how shark behaviour or ocean currents could have played a role, the inquest heard.\n\nAn orthopaedic surgeon told the inquest it was unlikely Caddick could have severed her own foot, as it would require \"significant force\" to cut through bone, cause major blood loss, and require specialist post-surgical care.\n\nBut scientists put forward a simple explanation at the inquest.\n\nOceanographers said currents could have easily carried the foot that distance, while a pathologist described how human feet can detach from bodies during decomposition.\n\nThe inquest also heard criticism of police handling of the case.\n\nOfficers assigned to the Caddick case stuck too closely to their view that she had voluntarily vanished, some said.\n\nPolice combed the cliffs in Dover Heights for any trace of Ms Caddick\n\nA crime scene examination of the house was not done until 19 days after Caddick disappeared, and a lawyer assisting the coroner questioned why the homicide squad wasn't brought in immediately, if only to rule out foul play.\n\nAnother detective expressed surprise that NSW Police only sought out the corporate watchdog's affidavit on Caddick - which outlined its case against her - some months after her disappearance.\n\nThe inquest was also told that Caddick had a life insurance policy, which included suicide cover, and had made a number of references to ending her life over the years - but police initially devoted limited resources to this line of inquiry.\n\nMagistrate Ryan on Thursday said the uncovering of Caddick's deception may have triggered a \"narcissistic injury\", with the illusion of her wealth and success shattered.\n\n\"The Asic investigation and search warrant very likely caused her a catastrophic level of shame and despair,\" she said.\n\n\"She may well have reached the conclusion that ending her life was the only option.\"\n\nBut the manner of her death will ultimately remain unresolved, she said.\n\nEqually unresolved are the losses of her clients, many of whom saw huge sums of money vanish.\n\n\"I sold my business as I was under the impression my money was safe, and I retired in 2017,\" one victim testified.\n\n\"To rub more salt in the wound she has also stolen my mother's money, wife's, mother-in-law, son, brother and sister\u2026 wiping out three generations of my family's savings.\"", "Kate Forbes, who finished second to Humza Yousaf in the SNP leadership race, has announced that she is leaving the Scottish government.\n\nScotland's finance secretary was on maternity leave after the birth of her daughter when Nicola Sturgeon suddenly announced that she was quitting as SNP leader and Scotland's first minister.\n\nWithin a couple of days of confirming she would be standing in the contest to succeed her, Ms Forbes found herself at the centre of a political storm.\n\nHer views on issues such as gay marriage, abortion, trans rights and having children outside of marriage were savaged by Deputy First Minister John Swinney, who had been standing in for the deeply religious Ms Forbes since last July.\n\nMs Sturgeon herself also made thinly-veiled barbs at the woman she had appointed finance secretary at the age of 29, just hours before she had to deliver a budget speech.\n\nScotland is a progressive country, Ms Sturgeon stated, and the views of the next first minister therefore matter.\n\nMs Forbes saw several supporters desert her campaign in response to the furore, which was ignited when she told journalists that she would not have voted for gay marriage had she been an MSP at the time.\n\nShe subsequently told Sky News that she believed that having children outside of marriage is \"wrong\" according to her faith as a member of the evangelical Free Church of Scotland, while stressing that: \"In a free society you can do what you want.\"\n\nMs Forbes has never hidden her religious beliefs, leaving pundits wondering why they had appeared to come as a shock to some of her supporters.\n\nThe Free Church, of which she is a devout follower, has strongly opposed gay marriage since it was legalised in Scotland in 2014.\n\nMs Forbes and her husband Ali celebrated the birth of daughter Naomi last year\n\nIn 2018, Ms Forbes spoke at the National Prayer Breakfast for Scotland a day after a Westminster debate on abortion, when she called on politicians to \"recognise that the way we treat the most vulnerable - whether the unborn or the terminally ill - is a measure of true progress\".\n\nShe was among the 15 SNP politicians who wrote an open letter to Ms Sturgeon the following year asking for a delay to gender recognition reforms that would allow people in Scotland to self-identify their sex.\n\nThe final vote on the proposals was held when Ms Forbes was on maternity leave, but when she launched her leadership campaign she made clear that she still had significant concerns about self-identification and would not have been able to vote for the legislation in its current form.\n\nSeveral senior figures within the Scottish government reacted with fury to her comments, with Mr Swinney saying he profoundly disagreed with her views despite also having deep Christian faith.\n\nHumza Yousaf warned that independence could only be won if the SNP sticks to \"progressive values\" and avoids a \"lurch to the right\".\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThe bubbling tensions boiled over in a televised STV debate, when Ms Forbes launched an attack on Mr Yousaf in which she slated his performance as a government minister.\n\nMs Forbes told Mr Yousaf: \"You were transport minister and the trains were never on time, when you were justice secretary the police were stretched to breaking point, and now as health minister we've got record high waiting times.\n\n\"What makes you think you can do a better job as first minister?\"\n\nMs Forbes presumably did little to endear herself to the SNP hierarchy watching at home - although Ms Sturgeon says she didn't tune in for the debate - when she declared that it was time for a new generation to lead the party and that \"more of the same is not a manifesto - it is an acceptance of mediocrity\".\n\nThe remark could be read as a dig at Mr Yousaf, who to some extent pitched himself as the \"continuity candidate\", and the record of Ms Sturgeon herself.\n\nShe later doubled down by saying she would potentially have space for Mr Yousaf in her cabinet if she won the contest - but not as health secretary.\n\nMs Forbes was born in Dingwall in the Highlands, but was partly raised in India as her parents travelled there twice as missionaries, the first time when she was four years old.\n\nHer parents are reported to have been members of the more liberal Church of Scotland, with Ms Forbes claiming that she had chosen to join the Free Church after returning from India as it was \"just down the road\".\n\nMs Forbes (centre) had two spells in India during her childhood\n\nShe went to a Gaelic school while in Scotland and became a fluent speaker of the language as a child.\n\nWhen she returned to India at the age of 10, she studied at Woodstock School - an international residential school in the foothills of the Himalayas.\n\nShe went on to complete degrees at Cambridge University and Edinburgh University and became a chartered accountant for Barclays in London.\n\nShe worked as an assistant to the SNP MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch, Dave Thompson, for two years before being selected to replace him when he stood down.\n\nOn the backbenches, the then 26-year-old campaigned to ban plastic straws and delivered a speech in the Holyrood chamber entirely in Gaelic.\n\nIn 2018 she entered government as public finance minister working alongside Derek Mackay, who she would go on to succeed as finance secretary when he was forced to stand down just hours before delivering his budget speech after it emerged he had sent inappropriate text messages to a 16-year-old schoolboy.\n\nMs Forbes became Scotland's first female finance secretary and was widely praised for delivering the budget speech with just a few hours' notice, having only received the call from Ms Sturgeon at 7am that morning.\n\nShe has said the SNP needs to win over No voters by using the Scottish Parliament's existing powers to show that Scotland can flourish if it is to secure independence.\n\nMs Forbes had only a few hours to prepare for a budget speech after being appointed to the finance brief\n\nMs Forbes told the Guardian: \"We keep holding ourselves as hostages to fortune by setting a timetable rather than by focusing on what is really going to shift the dial.\n\n\"So day one, I would start the campaign for independence. But I would do that through gentle persuasion, making the economic case and earning people's trust back. The more successful and effective we are at that, the shorter the timetable becomes.\"\n\nShe has said she would not raise income tax for higher earners and would instead focus on growing the economy and expanding the tax base by cutting red tape for businesses, improving transport infrastructure and having a \"cautious\" transition away from North Sea oil and gas.\n\nMs Forbes has also described the government's bottle return scheme as well-intentioned but \"badly executed\".\n\nDuring a Channel 4 debate, presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy told Ms Forbes that her views on taxation and economic growth sounded \"a bit like Liz Truss\".\n\nThe three candidates were Ash Regan, Humza Yousaf and Kate Forbes\n\nLittle of this would be popular with the Scottish Greens, whose power-sharing deal with the SNP would have been very unlikely to survive under Ms Forbes - particularly because of her views on social issues.\n\nThe SNP's social justice secretary, Shona Robison, said she would have to think long and hard about whether she would serve in government under Ms Forbes, while the party's deputy leader at Westminster, Mhairi Black, warned of a possible split if the finance secretary had won the leadership.\n\nSeveral of her colleagues were said to have been furious over her attack on Mr Yousaf's record, which they believe will be quoted repeatedly by opposition parties as they seek to attack the SNP's record in government.\n\nThe Scottish Conservatives have already said they want to use Ms Forbes' remarks in their next party political broadcast.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nIran's Revolutionary Guards say seven officers have been killed in an Israeli strike on the Iranian consulate building in Syria's capital, Damascus.\n\nBrig-Gen Mohammad Reza Zahedi, a senior commander of the elite Quds Force, and Brig-Gen Mohammad Hadi Haji-Rahimi, his deputy, were named among the dead.\n\nIran and Syria's governments condemned the attack, which destroyed a building next door to the Iranian embassy.\n\nThe Israeli military said it did not comment on foreign media reports.\n\nHowever, it has acknowledged carrying out hundreds of strikes in recent years on targets in Syria that it says are linked to Iran and allied armed groups which are armed, funded and trained by the Revolutionary Guards.\n\nThe Israeli strikes have reportedly been stepped up since the start of the war in Gaza in October last year, in response to cross-border attacks on northern Israel by Hezbollah and other Iran-backed groups in Lebanon and Syria.\n\nBut Monday's attack will be seen as a serious escalation.\n\nThe Israelis appear to be testing the resolve of the Iranians and their allies and signalling that they are serious about increasing pressure on their enemies.\n\nThe Israelis are looking at the fact that both Iran and Hezbollah have not been pushing as hard as some might expect.

The confrontation billed as a potential title-decider turned into an embarrassingly one-sided affair. Pep Guardiola's side, now two points behind Arsenal with two games in hand, were inspired by the devastating partnership of Erling Haaland and Kevin de Bruyne. Haaland sent De Bruyne away for a silky opener after seven minutes, and Arsenal then survived a constant bombardment of attacks before John Stones headed home from a free-kick in first-half stoppage time, the goal given by VAR after originally being ruled offside. City goal machine Haaland was outstanding throughout and again set up De Bruyne for the third in the 54th minute, the Belgian passing a classy finish between the legs of Gunners defender Rob Holding. Holding pulled one back for Arsenal late on before Haaland, denied four times by Arsenal goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale earlier in the match, sealed a memorable night with his 49th City goal. City can go top with victory at Fulham on Sunday while Arsenal must somehow pull out of a slump that has seen them go four league games without a win at a crucial stage of the season.\n\u2022 None Title in our hands and we must use that - Guardiola\n\u2022 None Reaction from Man City-Arsenal, plus the rest of Wednesday's Premier League games\n\u2022 None How did you rate Man City's performance?

Send us your views here City still have work to do to retain their title but, in the biggest game of the Premier League season, they delivered a brutal message. Guardiola was as fired up as his players in the early stages, raging in his technical area, even giving an animated lecture to goalkeeper Ederson after De Bruyne put them ahead. City were at their magnificent best as they tore holes in the Arsenal rearguard, the Gunners miraculously surviving all manner of close shaves after the opener before Stones' header gave them the cushion they deserved. Haaland had a rare night when his golden touch in front of goal deserted him until virtually the last kick of the game - although Ramsdale played his part in that - but the Norwegian demonstrated just how much his all-round game has improved under Guardiola by giving an exhibition in link-up play, twice assisting for De Bruyne and playing with an air of constant menace. And De Bruyne once more showed his enduring class with two precision finishes. The title is not run yet and no-one at City will be complacent, but this performance carried all the hallmarks of a side on a mission to keep their crown and who now have all the momentum with them. Another missed opportunity for the Gunners Manchester City 4-1 Arsenal: Mikel Arteta says team need to look in the mirror It was only a few short weeks ago that Arsenal's title challenge looked like it might well end with a first Premier League triumph since 2003-04. But that was before they carelessly threw away a two-goal lead at Liverpool, repeated the failing at West Ham and then faltered at home in a 3-3 draw with struggling Southampton. City presented the toughest of tests but also an opportunity to reassert themselves at the Premier League summit - but instead Mikel Arteta's team found themselves on the receiving end of a chastening beating. Arsenal looked nervous in the face of City's intensity and threat, the gap between the sides resembling a chasm right up to the final seconds when Haaland finally got on the scoresheet. The Gunners have desperately missed the authority of injured William Saliba in defence while they barely mounted an attack worthy of the name until it was too late. Arsenal have been outstanding this season and there will be no shame in coming up just short against this City team. If they do miss out - and remember, there is still hope - their recent dip in form will unquestionably leave them rueing a massive missed opportunity. If they are to somehow regroup from this mauling, they must do it quickly while also hoping City slip up somewhere along the line.

This means they can explode at a later date, killing or injuring people.\n\nNeither the US, Ukraine or Russia are signatories of the international treaty - the Convention on Cluster Munitions - banning the use or stockpiling of them over the indiscriminate damage they can inflict on civilian populations.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Selby, Yorkshire, on Saturday, Mr Sunak said the UK is \"signatory to a convention which prohibits the production or use of cluster munitions and discourages their use\".\n\n\"We will continue to do our part to support Ukraine against Russia's illegal and unprovoked invasion, but we've done that by providing heavy battle tanks and most recently long-range weapons, and hopefully all countries can continue to support Ukraine,\" he added.\n\n\"Russia's act of barbarism is causing untold suffering to millions of people.\"\n\nMr Sunak is due to meet with Mr Biden in London on Monday, ahead of a Nato summit in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius on Tuesday.\n\nRishi Sunak spoke carefully when asked for his response to the US now giving cluster munition to Ukraine.\n\nHe didn't criticise the US's decision but did point out that the Convention discourages use of the bombs.\n\nThe UK is the second largest provider of military assistance to Ukraine - only behind the US.\n\nAs the conflict in Ukraine evolves, so too are the responses of Kyiv's allies - on this issue the US and UK have gone in different directions.\n\nMr Biden justified supplying the weapons by saying the \"Ukrainians are running out of ammunition\".\n\nSpeaking to CNN in an interview due to air on Sunday, he said it had taken \"a while to be convinced\" to make the \"very difficult decision\" to send them.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has hailed the \"timely\" move to deliver the bombs.\n\nUkraine's Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov said his troops would not use them in urban areas to avoid risking civilian lives, adding \"these are our people, they are Ukrainians we have a duty to protect\".\n\nBut Spanish Defence Minister Margarita Robles has said her government's position is that cluster bombs should not be used for the \"legitimate defence of Ukraine\".\n\nGermany, which has also signed the convention, said it would not provide them to Ukraine but that it understands the American position.\n\nIn a statement, the Canadian government said it does not support the use of the weapons and emphasised its commitment to \"putting an end to the effects cluster munitions have on civilians - particularly children\".\n\nHuman Rights Watch said both sides had used the weapons in the war, causing \"numerous deaths and serious injuries to civilians\".\n\nThese comments were echoed by Amnesty International, who said cluster munitions pose \"a grave threat to civilian lives, even long after the conflict has ended\".\n\nThe UN human rights office has also been critical, calling for their use to \"stop immediately\".\n\nNato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said the military alliance takes no position on cluster munitions.\n\nTobias Ellwood, the chairman of the UK's defence select committee, urged the US to \"reconsider\" its decision - which he said was the \"wrong call and will alienate international goodwill\".\n\n\"Their use leaves deadly unexploded ordnance over the battlefield, killing and injuring civilians long after the war is over,\" the Conservative MP added.\n\nRussia described the US decision as an \"act of desperation\" in the face of the \"failure of the much-touted Ukrainian counteroffensive\".", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Rishi Sunak was challenged over his attendance record at PMQs\n\nRishi Sunak has refused to say whether Tory MPs accused of undermining the Commons Partygate inquiry into Boris Johnson should apologise.\n\nThe Privileges Committee said last week that the MPs, including Nadine Dorries and Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, had tried to \"interfere\" with the probe.\n\nAsked whether they should say sorry, the prime minister didn't say, adding he hadn't read the committee's report.\n\nMPs will decide whether to approve the findings at a debate next Monday.\n\nLast month, the Commons backed the committee's finding, in a separate report, that Mr Johnson misled Parliament over Covid rule-breaking in No 10.\n\nMr Sunak has never said whether he agrees with the findings of that report - and missed last month's vote to approve it, blaming a diary clash.\n\nThe follow-up report by the Privileges Committee, published last week, said several allies of Mr Johnson had sought to \"influence the outcome\" of its original probe into the former prime minister.\n\nIt accused the seven MPs and three peers, all Conservatives, of mounting attacks on the committee designed to \"discredit\" its findings.\n\nThe report has led to a free speech row, with several of those named, including Ms Dorries and Sir Jacob, saying there is no reason they should not be able to criticise its conclusions.\n\nAt a scheduled appearance at the Commons Liaison Committee, Mr Sunak did not respond to a question from Labour MP Sir Chris Bryant about whether the MPs named should apologise.\n\nInstead, he said he had not read the report - which runs to a handful of pages - from \"cover to cover,\" although he was aware of its findings.\n\nHe confirmed he had asked Lord Zac Goldsmith, one of the Tory peers named in the report, to apologise - but said this was because of his then role as an environment minister.\n\nLord Goldsmith quit his government post last week, citing unhappiness with green policies. He has denied a claim from Mr Sunak that he had refused to apologise over being named in the report.\n\nSir Chris, who chairs the Privileges Committee but did not take part in its probe into Mr Johnson because he had criticised him before it began, also criticised Mr Sunak for missing the Commons vote on its findings.\n\nThe prime minister replied he couldn't attend because he was scheduled to speak at a charity event, but the Labour MP accused him of choosing \"not be in Parliament\".\n\n\"But yesterday, you opined on the rule of cricket. Take us through that,\" he added, in an apparent reference to Mr Sunak's criticism of the Australia team on Monday.\n\nIn a series of testy exchanges, he also took a swipe at Mr Sunak's attendance record in Parliament, noting that he is scheduled to miss the next two sessions of Prime Minister's Questions.\n\nMr Sunak replied he will miss this week's session because he is attending an event marking the 75th anniversary of the NHS, whilst next week he is at a summit of Nato leaders in Lithuania.\n\nHe denied that he had any control over the timing of the NHS event, telling Sir Chris \"I did not decide when that was.\"", "Violence has erupted across France since the killing of a 17-year-old during a traffic stop on Tuesday\n\nA French policeman has been charged with homicide and is now in custody over the killing of a teenager during a traffic stop near Paris on Tuesday.\n\nThe 17-year-old, named as Nahel M, was shot at point-blank range as he drove off and crashed soon afterwards.\n\nAnger at his killing has sparked violence across the country. A march led by the boy's mother was marred by clashes on Thursday afternoon.\n\nIn a third night of unrest, 667 people were arrested, French officials say.\n\nIn Paris, shops were ransacked and cars set on fire overnight despite a heavy police presence.\n\nAcross France, 40,000 police officers were deployed, with 249 of them injured in Wednesday night's clashes, according to the interior ministry.\n\nEarlier, bus and tram services in Paris and the wider region stopped operating at 21:00 local time (19:00 GMT) on Thursday. Night-time curfews were in place in some suburbs.\n\nIn the town of Nanterre, where the teenager was killed, a huge fire engulfed the ground floor of a building where a bank is located.\n\nVideo and pictures on social media also appear to show piles of rubbish ablaze in several places.\n\nOfficers were injured on Thursday afternoon as well, during violence in Nanterre that followed a largely peaceful march calling for justice. It was attended by more than 6,000 people.\n\nPrime Minister \u00c9lisabeth Borne said she understood the outpouring of emotion following the 17-year-old's death, but condemned the riots.\n\n\"Nothing justifies the violence that's occurred,\" she said.\n\nThe teenager's death has sparked a wider conversation about the power of the police and the relationship between the authorities and people from France's suburbs, who feel segregated from the country's prosperous city centres.\n\n\"We have a law and judicial system that protects police officers and it creates a culture of impunity in France,\" Nahel's lawyer, Yassine Bouzrou, told the BBC World Service's Newshour programme.\n\nBut Nahel's mother said she did not blame the police in general, or the system, for the killing - just the officer who fired the lethal shot that killed her son.\n\nThe officer accused of killing him said he had fired because he felt his life was in danger. His lawyer told French radio station RTL that his client discharged his firearm \"in full compliance of the law\".\n\nSpeaking to the BBC on Friday morning, Thierry Clair, deputy secretary general of Unsad-Police trade union, said an investigation would \"determine whether this is a case of a legal or illegal use of a weapon\".\n\nHe said that by law, police officers may use their weapons in certain circumstances.\n\n\"The key thing is the principle of proportionality with the nature of the threat,\" Mr Clair said. \"For instance, one of the cases refers to stopping a vehicle whose occupants refuse to comply and present a risk for someone else if they attempt to escape.\n\n\"And the incident we're talking about - in which a weapon was used - might fall into that category.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

It was so important to him that it wasn't changed from how he finished it.\n\n\"But we could not resist authorising this project: the time is right; the people doing it are fantastic; and Strangelove should be brought to a new and younger audience. I am sure Stanley would have approved it too.\"\n\nDaughter Katharina Kubrick added: \"The subject matter of this film is particularly relevant again in our prevailing political climate.\n\n\"People often laugh when they would rather cry, and this is exactly how the film, and now the play, handles the possibility of the ultimate destruction of life on Earth; certainly, an important topic amongst many, to concentrate the mind.\"\n\nThe late director's family also granted access to Kubrick's archive, in which Iannucci said he had found papers relating to the film including \"some discarded scenes, first drafts [and] moments that they were going to shoot and then decided not to\".\n\nHe added: \"There are little shards of ideas there, and one or two of them have developed into full-scale new moments and new scenes in the final [play].\"\n\nArmando Iannucci is known for his TV and film work, but this is his first theatre project\n\nDr Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb - to use its full title - was released two years after the Cuban missile crisis brought the world to the brink of nuclear war.\n\nFoley said it's not hard to see \"the relevance to the idea of a type of Cold War between the West and Russia\" today.\n\n\"That's sadly come very much back into our lives,\" he said. \"You don't have to look very far to understand a kind of relevance about the potential for nuclear conflict, given what's going on with the invasion of Ukraine and everything that Putin is saying.\"\n\nIannucci added: \"Not just with the war in Ukraine, but also the whole apocalyptic sense of global warming and so on - it feels like a very relevant reassertion of the message that, this is the madness staring at us if we don't do anything about it.\n\n\"And currently, we aren't doing anything about it. So the outcome is not good.\n\n\"But if you can leave the theatre with that message and a smile, then all the better.\"\n\nThe pair have decided to keep the story set in the 60s, and Iannucci said it would feel both \"retro\" in its setting, and up-to-date with some of his trademark dialogue.\n\n\"It's got one foot in the 60s and one foot in the present day,\" he said.\n\nFoley added: \"There's something about how the men of that era behave in the film, and there was a specificity around the Cuban missile crisis and all of those things.\n\n\"And the look of it is great, so we quickly decided we're going to keep it in that period and let the obvious resonances just echo.\"\n\nThe film famously starred Peter Sellers in three main roles - the titular German scientist, a British officer who discovers a US general has unilaterally ordered a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union, and the American president who must attempt to avert all-out annihilation.\n\nThe stage version is now seeking a star to play multiple roles - albeit without the luxury of the time Sellers had to change costumes and make-up.\n\n\"They've got to be a great comic actor, of which we have very many,\" said Foley, who is artistic director of the Birmingham Rep. \"They've got to be of that shape-shifting kind of quality. They've got to want it.\n\n\"It's going to be a really tough gig. I'm sure some people, when we approach them, are going to go, 'No way, I'm not going to be compared with Peter Sellers in those roles.'\n\n\"But there will be someone who has the appetite and skill and talent and sees the opportunity to do it in their own way.\"\n\nIn Dr Strangelove, many of those holding great power over millions of lives are depicted as often actually being inept, ridiculous, reckless or unhinged. That's a strand of political satire that Iannucci picked up in his work like The Thick of It, US version Veep, and 2017 black comedy The Death of Stalin.\n\n\"It's these individuals who are very human and very fallible, and yet on whose word and actions ride the fate of, in Stalin's case millions, and in Dr Strangelove's case humanity,\" he said.\n\nThe writer and director is now also working on another theatre project about Boris Johnson and his role in the pandemic and Partygate, although full details have not yet been announced.\n\n\"Rather than trying to do a TV exploration of what's happening now, doing something live on stage feels like just the right moment to do it,\" Iannucci said of that play.\n\n\"Also, in the last three years, we've been so enclosed in our homes because of the lockdown, and have got addicted to our screens, so actually going out and seeing something live and in the flesh is all the more exciting. That's what excites me about actually doing it as a live stage show.\"", "Carrick's sentencing hearing was told he had taken \"monstrous advantage of women\" between 2003 and 2020\n\nMore than 10 people have reported further offences by serial rapist and former police officer David Carrick since he was jailed, a force has said.\n\nCarrick was sentenced to 36 life terms after admitting 49 charges, including 24 counts of rape, in February.\n\nThe 48-year-old committed most of his offences in Hertfordshire.\n\nThe county's police force said it was working with prosecutors and investigating the new reports, which included allegations of sexual assault.\n\nCarrick's sentencing hearing was told he had taken \"monstrous advantage of women\" between 2003 and 2020, while serving as an officer with the Metropolitan Police.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Bronk.\n\nThe weapons have been \"particularly effective\" when used in combination with artillery, he says.\n\nMaritime Brimstone missiles were also sent to Ukraine in 2022.\n\nBrimstones can be used against tanks, artillery and some smaller vessels such as landing craft, according to Capt Chris Carlson, formerly of the US Navy.\n\nThe missiles are normally fired from aircraft, but in Ukraine they are being modified to be fired from trucks.\n\nLaunching them from the ground reduces their effective range, says Capt Carlson.\n\nWhen used as anti-ship missiles, Brimstones are far too small to sink

a 23:00 BST curfew.\n\nBritain's Murray is ranked 40th but showed his pedigree on the SW19 grass to lead 6-7 (3-7) 7-6 (7-2) 6-4.\n\nThe second-round match was stopped at 22:39 because of the restrictions put in place by the local council.\n\nMurray, who has regularly played late in recent years, and Tsitsipas will resume a captivating contest on Friday.\n\nMoments after 36-year-old Murray had wrapped up the third set, tournament referee Gerry Armstrong walked on to the court and discussed stopping play for the night with each player.\n\nMurray, who screamed out as he fell just before serving out for the lead, signalled to his team the match was being cut short, while 24-year-old Tsitsipas quickly packed his bags.\n\nThe pair will return to Centre Court after Spanish top seed Carlos Alcaraz plays France's Alexandre Muller in the first match, which starts at 13:30.\n\u2022 None Djokovic set for 'duel of the veterans of the tour'\n\nEyes were instantly drawn to this potential blockbuster when the draw was made last Friday and, after both players negotiated their opening matches on different paths, it was billed as the box-office match of the tournament so far.\n\nFurther fuel was added by the memories from their feisty clash at the 2021 US Open, where Murray said he \"lost respect\" for Tsitsipas after a lengthy bathroom break before a final set which the Greek won.\n\nThis time, all the drama remained on the court.\n\nMurray is a two-time champion at the All England Club and has been talking bullishly about his chances of going deep in the draw this fortnight.\n\nDespite missing out on a seeding, which left him vulnerable to a tough early test, the former world number one insisted he had the ability and nous to cause anyone problems.\n\nFor many people, Tsitsipas felt ripe to be on the end of an upset.\n\nWith grass not his favourite surface and a patchy record on the surface this year, there was an optimism among the home fans that Murray could earn his most notable Grand Slam win since having career-saving hip surgery in 2019.\n\nAfter cruising past Ryan Peniston on Tuesday, the Scot also had the benefit of a day off, while Tsitsipas only came through a five-set duel with Dominic Thiem at almost 20:00 on Wednesday.\n\nBut the 2021 French Open runner-up and 2023 Australian Open finalist looked sharp - physically and mentally - as he showed glimpses of the form which has seen him long tipped to win one of the sport's four major titles.\n\nThere were tense moments in a tight first set where both players dominated on serve, Tsitsipas taking control of the tie-break to move ahead.\n\nThe second set followed a similar pattern.\n\nTsitsipas was edging the rallies as he continued to find range with his forehand, leaving Murray struggling to cope with his ferocious and consistent hitting from that side.\n\nBut, like he has done so often over the years, Murray continued to battle and managed to hold his service games with few issues as neither player conceded a break point.\n\nThat teed up another tie-break - and this time it was Murray who dominated it after finding his first serve when it mattered.\n\nMurray playing under the floodlights on Centre Court always creates a special atmosphere and the player, by now demanding more noise from the almost-capacity crowd, thrived on the energy.\n\nAfter not having a serious look at Tsitsipas's serve in the opening two sets, Murray broke to love right at the start of the third and maintained the momentum to move into the lead.\n\nHowever, there was a serious scare when he fell on the baseline.\n\nThe sound of his scream, along with the knowledge of his injury history, left the whole of Centre Court anxious and there was relief when he clambered to his feet before serving out.\n\nIt had long felt the end of the third set was the natural point to suspend the match and once that was agreed, Murray walked off to a thunderous ovation.\n\u2022 None Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone", "Actress Angela Thorne, best-known for starring in To The Manor Born, has died aged 84, her family has said.\n\nShe played

has urged the watchdog, Ofcom, to decide whether politicians should be allowed to present TV programmes on news channels.\n\nChris Banatvala said no-one foresaw the rise of politician presenters when the rules were being designed in the 2000s.\n\nHe said Ofcom should take \"a view about whether what is emerging is acceptable in terms of due impartiality\".\n\nThe regulator is reviewing its rules around politicians presenting TV shows.\n\nUnder Ofcom's rules, news must be presented with due impartiality, and politicians are not allowed to be newsreaders, interviewers or reporters \"unless, exceptionally, it is editorially justified\".\n\nOfcom says there are no rules against politicians hosting current affairs programmes, as long as they reflect a range of views.\n\nBut there's been a debate about how these rules apply to the growing number of programmes fronted by politicians on GB News and Talk TV, both relatively new channels.\n\nLast month, Ofcom commissioned research into these programmes after receiving hundreds of complaints about politicians presenting shows.\n\nThen this week, the regulator launched two investigations into potential rule breaches on two programmes, including the GB News show presented by the former cabinet minister, Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg.\n\nIn the episode in question, Sir Jacob read out a breaking story about the jury verdict in a civil case involving the former US president, Donald Trump.\n\nWriting in the Telegraph this week, Ofcom's chief executive, Melanie Dawes, said the regulator had a \"crucial role in preserving the integrity of broadcast news\" and a duty to \"ensure our rules remain effective\".\n\nMr Banatvala was Ofcom's director of standards when the regulator's rules around politicians presenting programmes were introduced in 2005.\n\nHe told the BBC that in a changing media landscape, we need \"a grown-up debate about whether and how we want to apply due impartiality to news\".\n\n\"It's evident now that news channels are blurring the boundaries between genuine news, current affairs and opinion,\" he said. \"That may be a good reason for Ofcom to look at these rules in the round.\"\n\nHe added: \"We may need to look at whether these rules are fit for purpose, and whether we need to amend or adjust them.\"\n\nHe said the tenor of programme on some channels in the UK \"is something that's come across the pond from America\".\n\nIt's long been common to see politicians hosting programmes that veer between partisan commentary and news coverage on channels such as Fox News in the US.\n\nThe UK's impartiality rules go back decades and were included in Ofcom's broadcasting code following its creation as the communications regulator in 2003.\n\nIf broadcasters are found to have breached the code, Ofcom has powers to impose fines and other sanctions.\n\nWhen the impartiality rules were drafted, Mr Banatvala said, they were felt to be \"ample and adequate to prevent any programme from using the same political party over and over again\".\n\n\"It wasn't ever envisaged that a news channel would use politicians from the same political party to present programmes, day in, day out,\" he said.\n\nGrilling two Ofcom directors at a meeting of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee in Parliament on Tuesday, SNP MP John Nicolson asked why the regulator was not taking more action over programmes fronted by sitting politicians.\n\nJohn Nicolson suggested Jacob Rees-Mogg's show had \"the grammar of a news programme\"\n\nSingling out Mr Rees-Mogg's programme on GB News, Mr Nicolson said \"every day, he churns out the same pro-Brexit, right-wing stuff\", arguing \"what he's doing is blurring news presenting and commentary\".\n\nHe asked: \"Why don't you act to stop this?\"\n\nKate Davies, Ofcom's public policy director, said the watchdog looks at current affairs programmes \"differently\" to those focused solely on news.\n\nFollowing further frank exchanges, Mr Nicolson said \"we've lost all sight of objective journalism\" and suggested \"we're going to proceed down a route where we end up with awful, American-style ranting at the camera, we're already seeing it, masquerading as news\".\n\nKate Biggs, Ofcom's content policy director, said the media watchdog takes its responsibility on impartiality and accuracy rules \"very seriously\".\n\nShe said the regulator's investigations into programmes \"do set a precedent for other editors\".\n\nTalkTV said it \"will engage with the Ofcom process and looks forward to defending its output.\"\n\nGB News

Aimee's blood sugar levels also worsened and her blood fat levels - lipids - went up.\n\nThis was a short-term study on just one set of twins, but the results highlight growing fears among some scientists about the possible impact of so-called ultra-processed foods on our health, which BBC Panorama has been investigating.\n\nProf Tim Spector, is a professor of epidemiology at King's College London, who studies trends in disease and oversaw the test.\n\nHe told BBC Panorama: \"In the last decade, the evidence has been slowly growing that ultra-processed food is harmful for us in ways we hadn't thought.\n\n\"We're talking about a whole variety of cancers, heart disease, strokes, dementia.\"\n\nThe term ultra-processed foods - or UPF - was only coined 15 years ago but it makes up about half the things we now eat in the UK.\n\nFrom sliced brown bread to ready meals and ice cream, it is a group of foods made with varying - but often substantial - levels of industrial processing. Ingredients used, such as preservatives, artificial sweeteners and emulsifiers, do not typically feature in home cooking.\n\n\"Ultra-processed foods are among the most profitable foods companies can make,\" says Prof Marion Nestle, a food politics expert and professor of nutrition at New York University.\n\nSome academics think the link is not coincidental.\n\nUltra-processed convenience foods contain chemicals that UK regulators say are safe, but Panorama investigates emerging scientific evidence of a link between some of these chemicals and cancer, diabetes and strokes.\n\nWatch on BBC iPlayer now, or on BBC One at 20:00 BST on Monday 5 June (20:30 in Northern Ireland and 23:10 in Wales)\n\nIn January, one of the most comprehensive studies on ultra-processed food - by Imperial College's School of Public Health - was published in The Lancet medical journal.\n\nThe study of 200,000 UK adults found that higher consumption of ultra-processed foods may be linked to an increased risk of developing cancer overall, and specifically ovarian and brain cancers.\n\nAnd, as of last month, the World Health Organization (WHO) is now cautioning against the long-term use of artificial sweeteners - citing potential health risks.\n\nIt follows dozens of studies linking increasing consumption of UPF to increased risk of developing serious illnesses.\n\nBut proving that specific ingredients cause human harm can be challenging - there are a range of other factors in our lifestyles that can cause these diseases. For example: lack of exercise, smoking or sugary diets.\n\nThe first investigations into mortality and consumption of ultra-processed food started in France at the University Sorbonne Paris Nord, as part of the ongoing study into the eating habits of 174,000 people.\n\n\"We have 24-hour dietary records during which they tell us all the foods, the beverages and so on, that they are eating,\" explains Dr Mathilde Touvier who heads up the study.\n\nThe ongoing research has already published results showing UPF may drive an increased burden of cancer.\n\nNancy (l) and Aimee (r) took part in the two-week long test\n\nMore recently, they have been looking into the impact of one specific ingredient - emulsifiers - which act as a glue in ultra-processed foods to hold everything together.\n\nEmulsifiers are the Holy Grail for the food industry - they improve the appearance and texture of food, and help to extend the shelf life far beyond that of less-processed food.\n\nThey're everywhere, in mayonnaise, chocolate, peanut butter, meat products. If you eat, you're likely to be consuming emulsifiers as part of your diet.\n\nBBC's Panorama was given exclusive access to Dr Touvier's early results.\n\nThey are yet to be peer reviewed - a crucial verification step for scientific studies - but she said they are still concerning.\n\n\"We observed significant associations between emulsifier intake and increased risk of cancer overall - and breast cancer notably - but also with cardiovascular diseases,\" she says.\n\nThis means that a pattern has been observed between consuming ultra-processed food and disease risk, but further research is needed.\n\nDespite the growing body of evidence, the UK's Food Standards Agency (FSA) - which regulates the food industry in England, Wales and Northern Ireland - has yet to issue any regulation restricting emulsifiers.\n\nWhen Panorama asked the FSA about the growing body of evidence that these additives could cause harm it said: \"We have not been presented with any evidence - by this programme or otherwise - of any specific emulsifiers which are believed to pose a risk to health.\"\n\nBut the FSA said it planned to hold a public consultation.\n\nCould the food industry itself be playing a role in pushing back on regulation?\n\nThe BBC Panorama team spent the past eight months investigating.\n\n\"Food companies are not public health agencies... their job is to sell products,\" food politics expert Prof Nestle told the BBC.\n\nShe said the food industry has been known to fund research, sponsor experts and disparage existing studies to prevent regulation.\n\nThe International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) is a body that receives funding from some of the world's largest food companies.\n\nIt says its mission is to \"provide science that improves human health\" - but it has previously published studies globally undermining regulation and public guidance on healthy diets. In 2012, the European Food Safety Agency was so worried about potential conflicts of interest, it insisted anyone associated with ILSI either had to resign from the institute or leave the agency.\n\nProf Alan Boobis, emeritus professor at Imperial College London, is an unpaid director of ILSI Europe and a former vice president of its board of directors. But he also heads up a group of UK scientists, known as the Committee on Toxicity which provides advice on the risk of chemicals in food to the FSA.\n\nMore than half the members of the committee have recent links to the food or chemicals industries. And over the past 10 years, the committee hasn't supported a single restriction on the use of any chemical additive in our food.\n\nProf Boobis told Panorama his advice wasn't slanted to favour industry, and he had always been \"totally committed to conducting and identifying the very best scientific research... whoever is funding it.\"\n\nThe Food Standards Agency said it had a \"clear code of conduct\u2026 for declarations of interest\" and that it had \"no evidence\" bias has affected its decisions.\n\nILSI said: \"[We] operate within a framework of the highest principles of scientific integrity.\"\n\nOne of the most controversial additives in UPF is the sweetener aspartame.\n\nTwo-hundred times sweeter than sugar, it has been heralded as a great low-calorie alternative - turning once unhealthy sugary drinks, ice cream and mousses into products marketed as \"healthy\".\n\nThere have been questions about its potential harm over the past two decades.\n\nThen, last month, the World Health Organization said, although the evidence is not conclusive, it was concerned that long-term use of sweeteners like aspartame may increase the risk of \"type 2 diabetes, heart diseases, and mortality\".\n\nAspartame is sometimes used to sweeten ice cream\n\nIn 2013, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) decided - after looking at all the available evidence - that aspartame was safe. The UK's Food Standards Agency accepted this position.\n\nThe Committee on Toxicity looked at a study into aspartame in 2013 and concluded that the results \"did not indicate any need for action to protect the health of the public\".\n\nSix years later, Prof Erik Millstone, emeritus professor of science policy at the University of Sussex, decided to review the same evidence considered by EFSA - to see who had funded the different studies.\n\nHe discovered that 90% of the studies defending the sweetener were funded by large chemical corporations that manufacture and sell aspartame.\n\nAnd that all the studies suggesting that aspartame may cause harm were funded by non-commercial, independent sources.\n\nA spokesperson for the Food and Drink Federation, a membership body for manufacturers, told the BBC that companies took \"the health of consumers, and safety of the food they produce, seriously - and adhere to the strict regulations\".\n\nA spokesperson for the International Sweeteners Association said: \"Low/no calorie sweeteners are safe to use, are amongst the most thoroughly researched ingredients in the world and have been approved by all major food safety bodies, including the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\"\n\nThe FSA says it will look into WHO's ongoing assessment of aspartame. And the government says it is aware of the growing concerns around UPF and has ordered a review into the evidence on ultra-processed foods.\n\nWatch Panorama - Ultra-Processed Food: A Recipe For Ill-Health? - on BBC iPlayer and listen to 5Live listeners have their say with Nicky Campbell, Is ultra processed food okay?", "For Dads By Dads runs a 10-week programme to educate new and expectant dads\n\nA dad who suffered a breakdown after witnessing the traumatic birth of his son says the impact a new baby can have on fathers is often overlooked.\n\nMark Williams, 48, said both the birth and supporting his wife through postnatal depression had a \"massive impact\" on his mental health.\n\n\"The first time I had a panic attack was in the labour ward thinking my wife and baby were going to die,\" he said.\n\nMark, from Bridgend, said he suffered in silence with depression for years.\n\nMark was diagnosed with anxiety, depression and later ADHD after the birth of his son\n\nThen in 2004 when his wife went into labour he witnessed her in prolonged pain and had to stand by helpless when she was rushed to theatre.\n\nWhen their baby was still small his wife was diagnosed with post-natal depression.\n\n\"Obviously I witnessed my wife go through those things as well,\" he said.\n\n\"I was really unwell, I was drinking, avoiding situations.\"\n\nHe began looking for support but struggled, and found a lack of conversation around new dads and mental health.\n\nHe was eventually diagnosed with anxiety and depression and later Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).\n\nHe said therapy, medication and learning coping skills through Cognitive Behavioural Therapy all played a part in improving his mental health.\n\nToday he is an advocate for fathers' mental health and wants to see more support for new and expectant dads.\n\n\"If dad is suffering with mental health or confidence, whatever that looks like, that can have an impact on the relationship and obviously on the child as well,\" he said.\n\n\"So it's really important that all parents should have our support.\"\n\nMark has been supporting the For Dads By Dads group in Torfaen, educating new and expecting men on the challenges of the early years of fatherhood.\n\nThe group was set up by another dad, Jacob Guy, who said: \"There were times where I did feel a little bit isolated and needed more information to be the best dad that I could be.\n\nJacob Guy found a lack of support for new dads when he became a father so set up a group\n\nWhen Jacob, 41, from Chepstow, Monmouthshire, became a dad he felt that he did not have a network of people who were going through the same thing and would understand how he was feeling.\n\nHe looked around for dad groups but was unable to find the support he was looking for.\n\nIn 2022 he decided to set up a 10-week programme aimed to give dads a safe space and to educate new and expectant dads by running workshops covering a wide range of subjects.\n\nFor Dads, By Dads aims to build confidence in new fathers\n\nThe group gives opportunities to fathers to share experiences, build a network of support and tackle the challenges that come with fatherhood.\n\nAnd that support is vital: According to the British Journal of Midwifery, one in 10 fathers are affected by post-natal depression, which is about the same rate as mothers.\n\nUp to 38% of new dads are worried about their mental health and want more support, according social enterprise DadPad, which was developed with the NHS and real-life dads.\n\nThe Welsh government said it was investing in the development of perinatal mental health teams and networks.\n\n\"We remain committed to improving perinatal mental health services and will consider what further action can be taken,\" it said.\n\nJacob said he had seen the positive impact being around other dads had had on new fathers.\n\n\"It's built their confidence to know we're not going to get it right all the time,\" he said.\n\n\"If we make mistakes, we dust ourselves down and we start again.\"", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Brexit has enabled the Westminster government to relax the rules for the newer technology.\n\nThe chief scientific advisor for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), Prof Gideon Henderson, says that the new rules will lead to better food production and bring jobs and investment to England.\n\n\"What's changed is that we can now use precision breeding technology developed in the lab and take it into the fields so that we can grow better crops and bring them to market more readily so that we can use the technology to enhance agricultural outcomes and food production in the UK and globally,\" he said.\n\nThe Precision Breeding Act allows only genetic changes that could also have been produced naturally or through traditional crossbreeding programmes already in use today. GM can involve the introduction of genes from other species and will not be permitted.\n\nGene editing enables researchers to make precise genetic changes to a plant's DNA, for example adding a gene to boost its growth or reduce dependence on fertiliser. The same change could be produced by crossbreeding different varieties, but it would take much longer.\n\nThe new law allows for the use of gene editing and other methods that may arise in the future, provided the end result is a crop that is no different to a variety that could have been naturally produced.\n\nGene-edited tomatoes rich in a chemical with calming effects are on sale in Japan\n\nCritics of genetically altered food, such as Pat Thomas of Beyond GM, are concerned that gene-edited crops will not have to go through the extensive testing required of GM foods in the EU, which may result in the introduction of toxins and allergens into the food chain.\n\n\"The entire process of this bill has been of the government consulting scientists with vested interests, usually in the biotech industry, who are reassuring the government that this change in the law will have no consequences,\" she said.\n\n\"History has shown that when you remove regulatory control, particularly for food and the environment, there is looming disaster on the horizon.''\n\nDefra's response is that the Food Standards Agency, the FSA will only authorise products for sale if they are judged to present no risk to health.\n\nThere is also concern that labelling of gene-edited food is not a requirement and it is unclear how GE food from England will be prevented from entering other parts of the UK, where it is still banned.\n\nA US firm is gene editing blackberries that don't have seeds\n\nA Welsh Government spokesperson said that this would create \"unavoidable consequences for Wales\".\n\n\"Gene-edited plants, animals and products from England will be marketable here without the authorisations our law requires,\" they said.\n\n\"This undermines the devolution settlement. The UK Government chose not to engage with us, despite our efforts, whilst developing the bill and this means the effects of it have not been properly considered.\"\n\nThe Scottish government has a long-standing opposition to GM and wishes to stay in step with the EU, though its stance is opposed by NFU Scotland who says it puts Scottish farmers at a competitive disadvantage.\n\nThe Northern Ireland government has to follow the protocol negotiated with the EU which requires that it remains in step with rules regarding the definition of GM crops in Europe, which also cover gene-edited crops.\n\nThere is however enthusiasm for the use of gene editing among some plant breeders in England.\n\nThe National Institute of Agricultural Botany, just outside Cambridge, has been breeding new varieties of crops for UK farmers for more than a hundred years.\n\nThey crossbreed different varieties to produce new ones that grow better and are more resistant to diseases. It can take ten to fifteen years of development. The head of the lab, Prof Mario Caccamo told BBC News that he wants to use the technology to develop new varieties that can grow well in the hotter, drier conditions that the UK is experiencing more regularly, because of climate change.\n\n\"When we look to how the population is growing and how much we are increasing our yields using traditional methods, we are lagging behind,\" he said. \"The projections show that we have to have an acceleration into how we can improve crops otherwise we are going to be struggling to feed the world.\"\n\nA new variety of barley being tested by KWS plant breeders in Hertfordshire will take twelve years to come to market using conventional breeding techniques. The firm claims that gene editing will significantly reduce that time.\n\nThe UK is among the world leaders in research into plant genetics. But that expertise has not been able to take off, because of the effective ban on the commercial development of the technology, according to its supporters. The hope is that the change in law will attract new investment leading to new companies, new jobs and new foods.\n\nBayer Crop Science has developed GM crops for use across the world, employing more than 30,000 people.\n\nBut in the UK, it has a staff of 90 who are involved in traditional plant breeding. The company isn't ready to announce any new investment plans in England yet - but the firm's head of marketing in the UK, Lindy Blanchard, welcomed the change in the law.\n\n\"We are really, really excited and we are committed to help farmers overcome the challenges of climate change and we want to provide safe sustainable food for society, so no doubt we will be looking at this but it is step by step.\"\n\nThe new act also has provision to allow gene-edited animals on English farms, like these disease resistant pigs, developed in Scotland. But that will require another vote by MPs in Westminster once the government is satisfied that animals won't suffer.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "Raymond Beggs, from St Mark's High School in Warrenpoint, and Noreen Kelly from St Dallan's Primary School on a picket line\n\nTeachers taking part in a strike that has closed most schools in Northern Ireland say they had no choice but industrial action.\n\nMembers of all five Northern Ireland teaching unions are on strike, mostly over a long-running pay dispute.\n\n\"Why is my labour worth so much less than it is in the rest of the UK when we have a world class education system?\" teacher Melanie Doherty asked.\n\nShe said teachers will leave Northern Ireland if they did not act.\n\nPublic service workers are also on strike with ports, MOT centres and courts affected.\n\nSpeaking before she joined the picket line with her colleagues at Foyle College in Londonderry, Ms Doherty told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster that she was \"downhearted\" but that teachers felt there was \"no other way\" to put their point across.\n\n\"We have a world class education system, but if we continue with the cuts and devaluing teachers we're not going to have that in Northern Ireland for much longer,\" she said.\n\nFor the first time, the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) is taking part in the full day's strike, joining four teaching unions who staged a previous walkout on 21 February.\n\nThe unions involved include the Northern Ireland Public Service Alliance (Nipsa) the civil servants union, along with members of the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), the National Union of General and Municipal Workers (GMB), Unite and all the teachers' unions.\n\nThe action by the unions representing teachers is mainly due to a pay dispute, with a stalemate over a deal running for more than a year.\n\nIn February 2022, unions rejected a pay offer from employers for the years 2021-2023 as \"inadequate\".\n\nSince then the cost of living has spiralled with inflation at more than 10%.\n\nBut with Stormont's education budget under severe pressure it is not clear how much money is available to make teachers a pay offer the unions would accept.\n\nMembers of the NASUWT (National Association of Schoolmasters and Union of Women Teachers) who work in further education (FE) colleges in Northern Ireland will, for the first time in the current dispute, join their colleagues on strike.\n\nIt is the first time in its 125-year history that members of the NAHT have taken strike action over pay.\n\nMark McTaggart, northern secretary for INTO (Irish National Teachers' Organisation), warned there would be a crisis in recruitment and retention of teachers in Northern Ireland.\n\n\"Teachers are significantly underpaid compared to every other teacher in these islands and schools across the north have no budgets in real terms,\" he told Good Morning Ulster.\n\n\"We are already talking about an education system which is half a billion pounds in debt -

At least 17 people, including a child, were injured by falling debris.\n\nAttacks on the energy grid has been part of Russia's warfare against Ukraine since 2022.\n\nMoscow has previously carried out strikes on Ukrainian power infrastructure plunging millions of people into darkness and depriving them of heat, power and water.\n\nAttacks during the autumn and winter of 2022 left 17 million Ukrainians without a regular supply of electricity for extended periods.\n\nBut the head of the Ukrainian grid operator, Volodymyr Kudrytsky, said Thursday night's attacks were worse.\n\n\"Even last winter, attacks on our energy system weren't so bad as last night. Dozens of grid facilities have been hit. This is on a global scale.\"\n\nMr Kudrytsky added that the worst affected area was Kharkiv, where \"Russia literally tried to destroy all the main energy facilities feeding the city\".\n\nFirefighters at a power station in Kharkiv after Russian missile attack\n\nPresident Zelensky has often described the Russian attacks on power stations as \"energy terrorism\".\n\nThe White House condemned Thursday's attacks and renewed its call for urgent additional air defences for Ukraine as soon as possible.\n\nEarlier this month, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for two top Russian commanders, accusing them of ordering attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure.", "Last updated on .From the section Cricket\n\nAustralia retained the Women's Ashes with a dramatic three-run victory over England, who so nearly pulled off a remarkable victory through Nat Sciver-Brunt's masterful unbeaten century.\n\nSciver-Brunt, who scored 111 off 99 balls, dragged England from 203-7 to a position where they needed 15 runs from the last over and five off the final ball.\n\nHowever, Australia and Jess Jonassen, who bowled the final over, held their nerve to retain the urn with one match to spare by virtue of being the holders.\n\nThe points-based series, which is now 8-6 in favour of Australia, concludes at Taunton on Tuesday.\n\nAustralia owe plenty to number eight batter Georgia Wareham, who smashed 26 from the last over of the tourists' innings, bowled by Lauren Bell, to drag them from 240-7 with three overs remaining.\n\nWhile it was a match-defining over, England were also left to rue another sloppy performance in the field, dropping all-rounder Ellyse Perry three times in her innings of 91.\n\nIn the second ODI at Bristol, England levelled the series with their highest-ever run chase and were set the task of breaking that record again to keep their hopes alive once more.\n\nEngland started positively, with opener Tammy Beaumont continuing her fine form with 60 from 62 balls before Australia's spinners once again proved the difference.\n\nAll seven England wickets fell to spin as leg-spinner Alana King and off-spinner Ash Gardner took three each to unravel the middle order.\n\nSciver-Brunt stood firm with a chanceless knock, her third unbeaten century in her past four ODI innings against Australia, but she slumped to her knees in devastation as she could only manage a single from the final ball.\n\nEngland can still draw the series with a win in the final ODI, but were visibly distraught by the defeat having dragged themselves back into contention after Australia initially raced into a 6-0 lead in the points-based series.\n\u2022 None Pick your team of the 2023 Women's Ashes\n\u2022 None Ashes has been best ever in women's cricket history -

which has been absent throughout the series.\n\nBut Sciver-Brunt found company in Amy Jones, who scored 37 in a stand of 57, until the game tilted back towards the visitors when Jones and Sophie Ecclestone departed in the same Gardner over.\n\nShe then found perhaps more unlikely company in Sarah Glenn, who played her number nine role expertly as she nudged and nurdled her way to 22 from 35 balls to give England hope, needing 21 from the last two overs.\n\nSciver-Brunt found the boundary at key moments to keep England in the game, and her fitness allowed her to run singles and twos between the wickets against Australia's incredible fielders.\n\nAs England's star player, there is more pressure on Sciver-Brunt and there were signs she was feeling it, without a half-century in the white-ball series until now.\n\nShe saved her best for when it mattered most, with the Ashes on the line, but once again fell cruelly short and had to watch even more jubilant Australian celebrations.\n\nSpin the difference as Australia serve reminder of class\n\nAustralia's spinners have been excellent throughout the series, even in defeat, but it has actually been a rare triumph for them.\n\nEngland have attacked them, and unsettled their usual dominance, and it has shown in the performances with the bat, in the field and from the seamers.\n\nA brave selection call was made, dropping pacer Darcie Brown for another spinner in King, and it proved pivotal.\n\nKing bowled with variation, deception of pace and changed the game with a beautiful turning delivery to bowl Beaumont and disrupt England's free-flowing scoring.\n\nGardner has had a phenomenal series, kick-started by her eight wickets in the Test, while Jonassen showed all her experience to expertly close out the game.\n\nThey also corrected their mistakes in the field, exemplified by Phoebe Litchfield's stunning full-length dive to turn a boundary into two runs, which may not have looked significant at the time but given the margin of victory, it was crucial.\n\nEngland once again fought so bravely, but were ultimately edged out by moments of greatness.\n\n'We showed all our grit and determination' - what they said\n\nAustralia captain Alyssa Healy: \"It was a really, really good game of cricket. Both sides really hung in there and Nat Sciver-Brunt, yet again, played an incredible innings - I thought she was going to take it away from us at the end.\n\n\"But full credit to our girls, they showed all their grit and determination again and we got ourselves over the line.\n\n\"To know that the Ashes are coming home with us is hugely exciting.\"\n\nEngland captain Heather Knight on BBC Test Match Special: \"It's been a ridiculous series, and has to go down as the best ever in history.\n\n\"How Nat played to get so close was brilliant. To nearly chase down that total was really good.\n\n\"Our focus now is to win both white-ball series.

It is a fine line to walk, however, as the competition - both militarily and economically - heats up.\n\nWith the meeting, Mr Xi was also sending a message to his own people that his government was reaching out to Washington.\n\nTaiwan is the biggest area of contention between the two countries and the one that has the highest potential of escalating.\n\nChina sees self-ruled Taiwan as a breakaway province and Mr Xi has indicated that he wishes to bring Taiwan under Beijing's control during his term in office.\n\nHowever, Taiwan sees itself as distinct from the Chinese mainland with its own constitution and leaders. US President Joe Biden said last year that the US would defend Taiwan in the event of an attack from China, a move condemned by Beijing.\n\nBut on Monday, Mr Blinken again stressed that Washington does not support Taiwan independence, adding that he sought to \"disabuse\" China of the notion the US is \"seeking to economically contain them\".\n\nHe said China gave some assurances too. It again stressed that it would not supply lethal aid to Russia to use in Ukraine, but Mr Blinken shared concerns about private Chinese companies aiding Russia's military.\n\nHowever, China knocked back a US proposal to restart communication channels between the countries' militaries - a key objective of the talks.\n\nWhile the trip yielded no great progress - as was expected - when concluding his news conference, Mr Blinken said he hoped it signalled better communication in the future.\n\n\"Progress is hard. It takes time. And it's not the product of one visit, one trip, one conversation,\" he said.", "Up to quarter of a million operations and appointments could be postponed due to next week's junior doctors' strike, the NHS Confederation warns.\n\nPatients are likely to see more of an impact because the four-day walkout comes after the Easter weekend, said Dr Layla McCay, director of policy at the health bosses' confederation.\n\nHealth bosses \"are more concerned about this than they have been about any other strike\", she said.\n\nThe walkout is due to start on Tuesday.\n\nHospital bosses have said they cannot guarantee patients will be safe as managers struggle to arrange staffing during the strike, which will affect both emergency and planned care.\n\nThe British Medical Association (BMA) says it will not exempt any services but that there are plans to protect patients, which could involve pulling junior doctors off the picket line if individual hospitals report lives are in immediate danger.\n\nIt is calling for a 35% pay rise to make up for 15 years of below-inflation wage rises.\n\nDr McCay told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"In the last junior doctors' strike, we saw about 175,000 appointments and operations having to be postponed.\n\n\"In terms of the disruption that we're anticipating this time, we reckon it could be up to about a quarter of a million so that is a huge amount of impact for patients up and down the country.\n\nThe walkout will be from 07:00 BST on Tuesday to 07:00 BST on Saturday. During last month's strike, hospitals drafted in consultants to provide cover but it is estimated a quarter of them are on leave due to the Easter holidays.\n\n\"With the junior doctors out for the four days, but those four days being bookmarked either side by the Easter weekend and another weekend, the disruption is going to go on for 10 or 11 days,\" said Dr McCay.\n\n\"What we expect to see is really significant diminished capacity within the health service.\"\n\nOn health leaders' fears about the strikes, she added: \"They think the impact is going to be so significant that this one is likely to have impact on patient safety, and that is a huge concern for every healthcare leader.\"\n\nPostponements are likely so that hospitals can focus on the most urgent and life-threatening cases, said Dr McCay.\n\nHealth Secretary Steve Barclay has been urged to meet union representatives over the bank holiday weekend to try to resolve the issue.\n\nDr Vivek Trivedi, co-director of the junior doctors' committee at the BMA, said they want to be sure Mr Barclay \"is serious about pay erosion\" - but added he is yet to put a credible offer on the table.\n\n\"All we're asking for is a credible offer that shows us he's serious, that we can start a path of negotiations to try to address the real-terms pay cut,\" he said.\n\nThe Department of Health and Social Care has said the BMA has to call off the strike for any negotiations to take place.\n\nIt says the government is working with NHS England to put contingency plans in place to protect patient safety during the strike.\n\n\"The NHS will prioritise resources to protect emergency treatment, critical care, maternity and neonatal care, and trauma,\" a spokesman said.\n\nAre you a junior doctor with a view on the strike?

The IDF then set out for us the results of their initial inquiry into the killing of seven aid workers in Gaza.\n\nRetired Maj Gen Yoav Har-Even described how the IDF's drone operators mistook an aid worker carrying a bag for a gunman, and then targeted one of the World Central Kitchen vehicles with a missile.\n\nThe IDF then described how two people escaped that vehicle and got into a second car, which was hit by another missile from a drone.\n\nThe military confirmed that there were survivors from the second explosion, who managed to get into the third vehicle - which was then also hit by a missile.\n\nBy the end, all the aid workers were dead.\n\nThe IDF's investigation concluded that the army unit involved had believed the vehicles they were tracking from the sky had been taken over by Hamas gunmen, and that they were not aware of the coordination procedures put in place between the military and World Central Kitchen for that evening.\n\nIt also said they also did not know the cars belonged to the charity, and the three air strikes were in violation of the army's own procedures.\n\nThree of the charity's cars were struck during the attack\n\nThe evidence from the investigation has been passed to the Military Advocate General - the Israeli army's top legal authority - to determine if there has been any criminal conduct.\n\nIn addition, the army has sacked the major in charge of fire support. The brigade's chief of staff, a colonel, has also been sacked. The divisional commander, brigade commander and the general in charge of the IDF's Southern Command have been formally reprimanded.\n\nThe IDF sought to explain the context leading up to the fatal events of that evening.\n\nThe aid workers had been overseeing the distribution of food aid that had arrived on a ship from Cyprus and unloaded at a recently constructed jetty in the northern Gaza strip. Under coordination with the IDF, the World Central Kitchen team were transferring these supplies to a warehouse a few kilometres further south.\n\nDuring this process, the IDF says their drone operators spotted a gunman riding on the roof of a large aid lorry that was being escorted by the WCK team. They played those of us at the briefing a somewhat blurry video - which has not been released to the public - showing a figure holding a gun, on top of the lorry. At one point the gun is fired, showing up clearly on the slowed-down black and white footage.\n\nAt this stage the military contacts World Central Kitchen but they are in turn unable to reach the team on the ground - where phone communication is patchy and aid agencies say they are prohibited by the IDF from using radios.\n\nThe drone footage also appears to confirm that at night, the stickers on the roof of the World Central Kitchen vehicles, with the charity's logo, are not visible to the drone operator.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: US says Israel must make changes in the coming \"hours and days\"\n\nThe military then tracks the convoy, including the aid lorry, to a warehouse. Then the convoy splits - the aid lorry remains in the warehouse and four SUV-type cars emerge. One of those vehicles heads north, and is then shown to contain gunmen, with weapons clearly visible from the drone footage, as they emerge next to another aid warehouse. The IDF say that these gunmen were not targeted, because of their proximity to an aid facility.\n\nMeanwhile, three remaining vehicles belonging to World Central Kitchen begin to head south.\n\nThe drone team, the army says, now working under the assumption that they are dealing with Hamas militants and not an aid convoy, had misidentified one of the aid workers as a gunman, and claimed to have seen them enter one of the three WCK cars.\n\nNo footage of this moment was provided, but the military investigation concluded that it was a \"misclassification... they saw that it's a rifle but at the end of the day it was a bag\".\n\nUnder the mistaken belief that one vehicle now contained a gunman, authorisation to fire a missile is sought, and granted by superior officers. At 23:09 the first vehicle is struck, two minutes later the second, and at 23:13 the third final, fatal strike is launched.\n\nThe military's conclusions are that three major failings occurred:", "The house met its auction guide price of \u00a31.5m\n\nA house on the Thames in south east London, which has long been the subject of local intrigue, has sold for \u00a31.5m.\n\nThe property, said to be known as the \"leaning tower of Rotherhithe\", is four storeys high and 3.5m wide.

thousands of people visited Westminster where she was lying in state.\n\nThe Home Office (\u00a374m) and Department of Culture, Media and Sport (\u00a357m) spent the most.\n\nThe costs incurred by the government departments relate to the Queen's funeral and other events in the run-up, including the monarch's lying-in-state.\n\nJohn Glen, chief secretary to the Treasury, said the government's priority at the time had been to make sure \"these events ran smoothly and with the appropriate level of dignity, while at all times ensuring the safety and security of the public\".\n\nIn a written

their respective costs.\n\nAfter Queen Elizabeth II died on 8 September 2022 aged 96, the UK started 10 days of national mourning.\n\nThe late Queen's coffin was laid to rest in St Giles' Cathedral in Edinburgh for 24 hours, before the monarch was taken to Westminster Abbey in London where thousands of mourners queued for hours to pay their respects.\n\nPeople lined up in London at all hours of the day, often in chilly temperatures, to pay their respects - including David Beckham.\n\nThe wait time at one stage was estimated to be more than 24 hours; and the queue snaked from Westminster Hall, down along the River Thames and stretched south for almost seven miles (11km).\n\nThe scale of the state funeral and mourning arrangements led to what police described at the time as \"probably the

his unsuccessful campaign to be Tory leader last year.\n\nHe faced calls to be transparent about his finances after it emerged his wife, Akshata Murty, had non-dom status.\n\nThe tax details came as MPs questioned former Prime Minister Boris Johnson over whether he misled Parliament over Partygate.\n\nMr Sunak is thought to be one of the richest MPs in Parliament and his personal wealth is something opposition parties have often used as a political attack line.\n\nThe PM worked in finance before entering politics and he and his family are thought to own several properties, including a Grade II-listed manor house in his North Yorkshire constituency.\n\nIn the last financial year alone, 2021-2022, the prime minister earned more than \u00a31.9m in income and capital gains, according to the records.\n\nCapital gains are taxed at 20% in the UK, while the highest income tax band is 45% on earnings over \u00a3150,000.\n\nThe records show the total UK tax he paid was:\n\nNimesh Shah, chief executive of tax advisory firm Blick Rothenberg, pointed out that Mr Sunak only released a summary of his income and gains, rather than a traditional tax return filed with HM Revenue & Customs.\n\n\"Whilst the public knows more now than it did before the release, it doesn't show the full picture,\" he said.\n\nMr Shah said the supporting notes from Mr Sunak's accountants \"give an explanation of how his tax position is made, rather than it being left to interpretation of his tax returns\".\n\n\"The release is a fairly controlled way of publishing his tax information.\"\n\nEarlier this month, during a trip to Paris for talks with French President Emmanuel Macron, Mr Sunak said he had been too \"busy\" to publish sooner.\n\nLabour said it was right Mr Sunak had published his tax returns \"after much delay\".\n\nThe party's deputy leader Angela Rayner said: \"They reveal a tax system designed by successive Tory governments in which the prime minister pays a far lower tax rate than working people who face the highest tax burden in 70 years.\"\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said he hoped to be able to publish his tax returns on Thursday.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats said Mr Sunak \"snuck\" the records out \"whilst the world is distracted with Boris Johnson's Partygate grilling\".\n\n\"People will be much more concerned today about the staggering tax hikes Rishi Sunak has imposed on them,\" the party's Cabinet Office spokesperson Christine Jardine said.\n\nMr Sunak said he was glad to publish his tax return \"in the interests of transparency\".\n\nAsked on a visit to north Wales if, given his wealth, he could understand what it is like for people struggling to heat their homes, Mr Sunak said: \"Ultimately what people are interested in is what I'm going to do for them.\"\n\nPointing to government support with energy bills, he said tackling the cost of living was his \"number one priority\".\n\nWhile there is not a long tradition of prime ministers publishing their tax returns, some of Mr Sunak's predecessors have chosen to do so in recent years.\n\nFormer Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron published his tax return in 2016 after revelations about his late father's offshore fund were revealed in the Panama Papers.\n\nTheresa May released her tax return during her campaign to be Tory leader in 2016, but did not do so when she was prime minister.\n\nThe two previous prime ministers, Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, did not publish their tax returns.\n\nThe financial affairs of Mr Sunak and his family were thrust into the media spotlight when he was chancellor in 2022.\n\nMr Sunak's wife, Ms Murty, revealed she had non-dom status, which meant she did not pay UK tax on her overseas earnings.\n\nMs Murty is the daughter the billionaire founder of Indian IT giant Infosys and owns a share of the company, entitling her to dividend payments.\n\nAs Mr Sunak came under political pressure, Ms Murty released a statement saying she would pay UK tax on her overseas income but retain her non-dom status.\n\nAt about the same time, Mr Sunak admitted he had held a US green card - allowing permanent residence in that country - while he was chancellor.\n\nHe returned the green card in October 2021, ahead of his first trip to the US as a UK government minister.\n\nFollowing these revelations, Mr Sunak referred himself to the prime minister's ethics adviser, who cleared him of breaching ministerial rules over the declaration of his financial arrangements.\n\nThe document released by the government includes an explanation of the prime minister's tax affairs from 2019.\n\nThe document says all of Mr Sunak's investment income and capital gains \"relate to a single US-based investment fund\", which is listed as a \"blind management arrangement\" on the register of ministers' interests.\n\nPoliticians with share portfolios and investments routinely set up blind trusts when they get government jobs. This allows them to continue earning income from their investments without knowing where the money is invested to avoid any conflicts of interest.\n\nThe document says \"some of the income of the US-based investment fund is also subject to tax in other jurisdictions (including the USA)\".\n\nMr Sunak is thought to be one of the richest MPs in Parliament\n\nMr Sunak - who has previously worked as an analyst for the investment bank, Goldman Sachs - has acknowledged that his investments are kept in a financial arrangement known as a blind trust.\n\nIn February, in an interview with TalkTV presenter Piers Morgan, he was asked whether it was right for prime ministers to have blind trusts.\n\nMr Sunak said: \"I think that's better than them having control over them.\"\n\nMr Sunak's records also show that the prime minister paid tax in the US on dividends in the country. A dividend is a sum of money paid by a company to its shareholders out of its profits.\n\n\"These US dividends were also subject to tax in the UK,\" the document says.\n\nThe document says Mr Sunak's previously held green card status did not impact his tax liability in either the UK or the US during the three financial years reported.", "Shekhar Kapur says Hollywood's push to cast actors of colour comes from guilt\n\nDirector Shekhar Kapur has said Hollywood's push for more diverse casts has come from its guilt over \"all the actors who are not getting work\".\n\nKapur said the inclusion of ethnic minority actors in shows such as Netflix's Bridgerton is \"a good thing\" in terms of opportunity.\n\nBut, he said, it hides \"a greater, more fundamental issue\" of which stories are brought to the big screen.\n\nHe added the rise in protests had helped bring the issue to the fore.\n\n\"Hollywood should be telling stories of that culture, of the culture of the brown people, of the African-American people, of the black people, of Asians,\" he told BBC Newsnight's Sima Kotecha.\n\n\"But what's happening is they're still addicted to their, you know, the narrative is still their point of view.\"\n\nKapur is best known for his films Elizabeth and its sequel The Golden Age, both starring Cate Blanchett, and Bollywood films such as Mr India and Bandit Queen.\n\nWhen asked about Hollywood's efforts to increase the diversity of actors in its films, Kapur described it as \"a guilt trip\" and woke.\n\n\"It's Hollywood feeling guilty about all the actors that are not getting work.

I am very disappointed by Labour's lack of ambition, says union leader\n\nLabour needs to be \"bolder\" and \"more ambitious\", rather than \"tinkering around the edges\", the head of the UK's second largest union has told the BBC.\n\nUnite leader Sharon Graham warned that otherwise \"apathy\" would be the winner at the next general election.\n\nThe union gives more money to Sir Keir Starmer's party than any other.\n\nMs Graham saw off a bid this week by some members to end Unite's affiliation to Labour, which guarantees the party nearly \u00a31.5m a year.\n\nShe argued it would be the worst time to leave the Labour Party when it was \"within touching distance of power, because that would reduce union influence\".\n\nMs Graham's membership spans public and private sectors, so what influence does she want to exercise?\n\nNext Saturday, Labour's National Policy Forum meets behind closed doors in Nottingham.\n\nIt brings together trade union representatives with MPs, grassroots members, and some shadow ministers.\n\nAlthough any policies agreed there are not guaranteed to be included in the next election manifesto, trade unions can make very clear where their priorities lie.\n\nFor Unite, taking energy companies and the struggling steel industry into public ownership are near the top of its agenda.\n\nDuring a number of meetings with the Labour leadership, Ms Graham has pressed her case that it would be cheaper to buy a steel industry that has lost much of its market value, than to bail out its private owners.\n\nThe Labour leader was publicly urged to do this when he spoke at Unite's policy conference in Brighton this week.\n\nBut while he has talked of \"preserving\" the industry if Labour wins power, he would not commit to acquiring it for the state.\n\nMs Graham is now intending to take a less conventional approach to policy-making.\n\nThe plan is for \"hundreds of organisers\" to go to marginal seats and talk to voters there about the case for taking key industries into public hands.\n\nThe message will be reinforced by Unite-funded billboards.\n\nThe hope is that then voters will press local Labour parties and local candidates to commit to backing nationalisation.\n\n\"We will take our ideas to the people,\" Ms Graham told me.\n\n\"The real decision-makers are the voters. If they push those ideas, politicians tend to move when they speak to voters.\"\n\nHer over-arching criticism is that Labour's leadership is not setting out a distinctive enough alternative to the government, and feels too constrained by the state of the economy.\n\nShe argued that \"we need be as bold as the 1945 Labour government\" which created the NHS. \"There wasn't much money about then, I can tell you,\" she said.\n\nThe next Labour government could leave a lasting legacy, she suggested.\n\n\"People will say they remember when energy companies were privatised and when they paid massive bills, and it was a Labour government that stopped all that.\"\n\nThe Labour leadership would argue that unless the party is trusted on the economy, many of the things trade unions want - like increased employment rights - simply won't happen.\n\nIts strategists also believe that it has to be seen to be moving away from Corbyn-era policies to win back voters who abandoned the party in 2019.\n\nBut Ms Graham told me that abiding strictly by shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves's \"fiscal rules\" had led to \"inertia\", and people were beginning to ask: \"What's the difference?\" between government and opposition.\n\n\"If Labour are saying what's happening now is awful, and it is absolutely awful, they have to come out with solutions to that.\"\n\nWhile Labour is criticising the number of children in poverty, its shadow ministers have been told they can't commit, for example, to provide free school meals for all primary children, because that would be a spending commitment.\n\nMs Graham said the party must \"talk about what they can do to change Britain. People want something to vote for.\"\n\nShe told her members this week that maintaining Unite's financial link to Labour would give her \"maximum leverage\" with the party.\n\nBut so far she hasn't moved policy on energy and steel. So by guaranteeing funds to Sir Keir Starmer, wasn't she actually reducing her bargaining power?\n\n\"The affiliation fee is what you pay to be part of the club. But most of the money we gave Labour traditionally was outside the affiliation fee,\" she said.\n\nFor example, the union donated an additional \u00a33m to Labour before the last election.\n\nBut Ms Graham warned there were \"no blank cheques\".\n\n\"I want to see some movement if we are going to give what we usually give... We would be better off with a Labour government, but I am very, very disappointed with the lack of ambition.\"", "A large tree has fallen in Killyleagh, County Down\n\nFallen trees and power outages have caused disruption across Northern Ireland during Storm Kathleen.\n\nA yellow warning for strong winds ended at 22:00 BST, with the strongest gusts recorded reaching 69mph in County Down.\n\nSome flights - including all Aer Lingus services at Belfast City Airport - and ferry sailings were cancelled.\n\nFor the second time this year, part of the roof of Titanic Belfast was damaged by strong winds.\n\nThe Met Office had warned of possible travel disruption, power cuts, and a risk of injuries from large waves.\n\nSimilar weather warnings were also issued in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nA spokesperson said Titanic Belfast visitor centre was shut on Saturday afternoon and would remain closed on Sunday as a \"precautionary measure\".\n\n\"Due to the ongoing inclement weather, access to the roof to assess the damage is limited and remedial works can not yet begin to take place,\" they said.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nPre-booked customers are to be refunded, with the attraction expected to re-open on Monday.\n\nIt had previously been impacted by Storm Isha in January.\n\nFallen trees, downed power lines and some flooding also led to the closure of a number of roads including:\n\nStena Line cancelled four sailings between Belfast and Cairnryan on Saturday due to the adverse weather.\n\nA 19:30 sailing from Cairnryan to Belfast has also been delayed.\n\nStena Line services between Dublin and Holyhead were also cancelled.\n\nP&O said its ferry sailings between Larne and Cairnryan at 12:00, 16:00 and 20:00 were off.\n\nA British Airways flight from London Heathrow was diverted to Belfast International on Saturday morning.\n\nPassenger Jonathan Pankhurst said the flight made two attempts to land in its original Belfast City destination before landing in Aldergrove instead.\n\n\"It was a rollercoaster ride to be honest, I think I was at Blackpool Pleasure Beach,\" he told BBC News NI.\n\nJonathan Pankhurst's flight from London's Heathrow was diverted to Belfast International on Saturday\n\nNIE Networks said about 750 customers have been left without power after high winds caused \"a low level of damage to the electricity network\".\n\n\"Our teams are working to repair any damage caused and restore power as quickly as possible,\" a spokesperson added.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, 12,000 homes, farms and businesses were left without electricity by Storm Kathleen.\n\nESB Networks said the largest outages were in counties Mayo, Sligo, Leitrim, Laois and Wicklow.\n\nA spokesman said crews aim to restore supply power to the \"vast majority\" on Saturday evening, however some would be without power overnight.\n\n\"We apologise to all homes, farms and businesses impacted for the inconvenience caused,\" he said.\n\nThe colourful houses of Whitehead were sprayed by the waves on Saturday morning\n\nStormont departments had advised people not to visit forests, country parks or nature reserves in the affected areas and to be careful when driving.\n\nThe Stormont Estate was also closed as a precaution while vehicle access to forests, including for caravanning and camping, was also suspended for the duration of the weather warning.\n\nTravellers have been advised to check providers for updates.\n\nThe strongest wind was recorded at 69mph (111 km/h) at Orlock Head in County Down.\n\nAs of noon on Saturday, other strong winds were recorded at:\n\nThe Department for Infrastructure said on Friday that \"multi-agency partners including the PSNI (Police Service of Northern Ireland), NIE (Northern Ireland Electricity), the Department for Infrastructure and other emergency response and public sector organisations have met to prepare for Storm Kathleen\".\n\nBelfast City Council said due to the weather conditions, all grass pitches at Victoria Park, Cherryvale, Wedderburn and Strangford would be closed.\n\nA yellow warning for wind in parts of the Republic of Ireland was lifted at 20:00 local time.\n\nBut a fresh yellow warning has been issued for Donegal, Mayo and west Galway until 16:00 local time on Sunday.\n\nWaterford and Wexford are also impacted by strong winds for several hours overnight.\n\nDublin Airport said it was open, but passengers should continue to check for updates.\n\nLarge waves caused by Storm Kathleen battered the coast in Salthill, County Galway\n\nSix flights - three inbound and three outbound flights - had been cancelled by noon.\n\nA separate flight from Dallas to Dublin was diverted to Paris due to the weather conditions, the airport said.\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

Dorset Police was involved in carrying out raids as part of Operation Mille\n\nPolice have seized up to \u00a3130m worth of cannabis plants and arrested almost 1,000 people in the UK's largest ever crackdown on organised crime.\n\nMore than 180,000 plants were discovered in raids across England and Wales in June.\n\nOfficers also seized 20 firearms, \u00a3636,000 in cash and 20kg of cocaine, with a potential street value of \u00a31m.\n\nThe operation has been described as the \"most significant\" of its kind ever run across UK law enforcement.\n\nSome 182,422 plants were seized, worth an estimated \u00a3115m-\u00a3130m\n\nOperation Mille targeted what law enforcement believe is a cash cow for organised crime gangs (OCGs) who are also involved in other offences such as money laundering, Class A drug smuggling and violence.\n\nCannabis is a Class B drug, not Class A like heroin or cocaine, but large-scale cannabis cultivation is seen as a key source of illicit income for criminal gangs.\n\nThe aim of the month-long operation was to disrupt OCGs by taking out a key source of their revenue, apprehending those involved and gathering intelligence on how the networks operate.\n\nSteve Jupp, the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) lead for Serious and Organised Crime, said the operation had \"successfully disrupted a significant amount of criminal activity\".\n\n\"We know that organised networks involved in cannabis production are also directly linked to an array of other serious criminality such as Class A drug importation, modern slavery and wider violence and exploitation,\" he said.\n\n\"The intelligence gathered will also help inform future law enforcement across the country.\"\n\nAround 11,000 officers from all 43 police forces in England and Wales, as well as the National Crime Agency and Immigration Enforcement, co-ordinated over 1,000 warrants in June.\n\nOf those arrested, more than 450 people have since been charged.\n\n\"Cannabis-related crime is often thought to be 'low level', however there are clear patterns around the exploitation and violence organised crime groups are using to protect their enterprises,\" Mr Jupp added.\n\n\"We also frequently find that cannabis production is just one aspect of their criminal operations and that they are complicit in wider offending which blights our communities.\"\n\nThe NPCC is a body which brings leaders across police forces in the UK together to set policy direction.\n\nThis was among the items seized during the operation\n\nAlmost

That has provided a great stable base for a number of decades but, sometimes, in order to be able to compete on a global scale we need to bring in private investment also,\" said Gould at a launch event before the new English domestic season starts on Friday.\n\nThe Hundred was created by the ECB to attract a more diverse audience and to fit into shorter broadcast slots.\n\nA record 580,000 fans attended matches in 2023, with 41% of tickets sold to families and 30% to women.\n\nHowever, the tournament has faced criticism from traditional cricket fans, who are unhappy with how some of the 18 counties are represented in the tournament.\n\nThe eight Hundred sides see counties combined, such as Yorkshire and Durham at Northern Superchargers, but others face lengthy journeys with fans of Somerset and Gloucestershire having Cardiff-based Welsh Fire as their nearest side.\n\nAsked if there was a danger that investment at team level may result in money being harder to filter down and teams feeling more marginalised, Gould said he did not think that was the case.\n\n\"The way that our sport is organised and governed, everything under one umbrella, does allow us to make sure that any money that is available is invested in the area that is most appropriate and where we'll get the most return,\" said Gould.\n\nThe ECB are committed to the tournament until 2028 in a broadcast deal with Sky Sports, and Gould feels investment will take the tournament to new levels over the next five years.\n\n\"The excitement levels will significantly increase,\" he said.\n\n\"We'll be able to make sure we retain and attract all the best players in the world and have a game that either broadcasters, supporters or new fans want to be involved with.\n\n\"I'm very excited by what that could bring for the whole ecosystem of cricket, whether that is franchise led teams or county clubs.\"\n\nSam Billings, who captained Oval Invincibles to the 2023 men's title, told BBC Sport: \"We want to be the second-best competition in the world, so it is how we do that.\n\n\"It might be a partnership, and that is a really key word, because if it is and it is always invested back into the fabric of our game then those are the key components, because ultimately we still want the English game to be incredibly strong in 50-100 years.\"\n\nThe 2024 edition of The Hundred begins on 23 July, with selected games on BBC TV.", "The battle for Bakhmut has become the longest of the war that Russia launched last year\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has congratulated the Wagner paramilitary group, after it claimed to have captured the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut.\n\nWagner founder Yevgeny Prigozhin - posing with some of his fighters - made the claim in a video posted to social media on Saturday.\n\nUkraine's deputy defence minister rejected the claim, but admitted the situation in the city was \"critical\".\n\nOne of the war's bloodiest battles, fighting has raged since August.\n\nWagner paramilitary forces have led the Russian attack on Bakhmut - which analysts say is of little strategic value to Moscow - and has seen thousands of troops killed.\n\nUkraine, for its part, has also decided to make a stand in a battle which has become the longest and bloodiest of the war so far.\n\nBut in comments carried by Russian state media, Mr Putin claimed Wagner troops, supported by Russian air force jets, had completed \"the operation to liberate\" Bakhmut on Saturday after months of intense fighting.\n\nMr Prigozhin, a close ally of the Russian president, leads the thousands-strong group, nominally a private military company.\n\nHe has claimed before that his forces have taken Bakhmut - or most of it - only for Ukrainians to swiftly deny the claims. Mr Prigozhin has also targeted top Russian military officials, criticising them publicly for not supplying his troops with enough ammunition.\n\nIn his latest video claiming control of Bakhmut, Mr Prigozhin said \"no-one can pedantically reproach us for the fact that at least some piece was not taken\".\n\nExplosions can be heard in the background, suggesting fighting continues close to the city, if not inside it.\n\nHe also promised to hand the city over to regular Russian troops later in the month.\n\nHis claims were echoed by the Russian defence ministry on Saturday night, state media in Moscow reported.\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin claimed to control Bakhmut in a video flanked by Wagner fighters\n\nBut in a statement on the messaging platform Telegram moments afterwards, Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said: \"Heavy fighting in Bakhmut. The situation is critical.\n\n\"As of now, our defenders control some industrial and infrastructure facilities in the area and the private sector.\"\n\nWestern officials estimate between 20,000 and 30,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded in Bakhmut, while Ukraine's military has also paid a heavy price.\n\nThere is hardly a building left unscathed, and the city's entire population has vanished.\n\nThe latest Wagner claim came as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky went to Japan to attend a meeting of the leaders of the world's most industrialised countries, the G7.\n\nHis Western allies pledged more support, including taking a significant step towards providing F-16 fighter jets, and announced more sanctions on Russia.\n\nRussian troops invaded Ukraine on 24 February last year and control parts of its east.\n\nUkraine has been expected to launch an offensive to retake seized territories, but Mr Zelensky recently said that more time is needed to prepare.\n\nHe has called Bakhmut \"a fortress\" of Ukrainian morale.\n\nUkraine's hope is that the fight over Bakhmut has blunted Russia's ability to conduct its own offensive operations, and exhausted its army and supplies.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Protesters ran onto the Scottish Grand National course\n\nPolice have charged 24 people after animal rights protesters tried to disrupt the Scottish Grand National.\n\nA large group breached fences at Ayr racecourse and made towards the track at about 15:20 before a further smaller group tried to disrupt a later race.\n\nPolice Scotland said officers \"safely removed\" people on both occasions and no injuries were reported.\n\nThe force confirmed all 24 charges were over breach of the peace.\n\nAll were released and are due to appear at Ayr Sheriff Court on Monday.\n\nSecurity was ramped up at the racecourse after protests delayed the start of the Grand National last week.\n\nThe Ayr protest followed the death of horse Oscar Elite in the 13:50 race on Saturday. Activists said they wanted to stop other horses from dying or coming to harm.\n\nAlthough the activist group Animal Rising claimed to have delayed the 18-horse event, won by Kitty's Light, it started only three minutes late.\n\nThe group said it wanted to highlight the exploitation of animals for sport and food.\n\nIt said it will continue with more race disruptions as well as a series of farm occupations and animal \"rescues\".\n\nProtester Sarah McCaffrey from the group said last week's protest at the Grand National started a \"crucial conversation about our relationship with animals and nature\".\n\nOn Saturday, she said: \"Today we continue that conversation. As a society, we love animals, but we have to find a way to care for them without harming them.\"\n\nMs McCaffrey called for an end to horse racing and a transition to a plant-based food system.\n\nAnimal rights campaigners attempted to rush onto the course\n\nPolice Scotland Assistant Ch Con Tim Mairs said police officers and stewards had responded swiftly to intervene and \"prevent further escalation\".\n\nHe said: \"We worked closely with the event organisers and other partners ahead of the Scottish Grand National to ensure a proportionate plan was in place to keep people safe and facilitate peaceful protest.\"\n\nAyr's managing director David Brown also praised the swift action of the police and security teams on course.\n\nHe said: \"The race went off to time, there was no notable delay and the professionalism of the team up here in Scotland was a credit to them, they dealt with it in a very efficient manner.\"\n\nFollowing the Grand National at Aintree last week, Merseyside Police said they arrested 118 people over disruption which saw nine people enter the course.\n\nUp to 17,000 people were expected at Ayr racecourse for the Scottish version of the race.\n\nThe Scottish Grand National was inaugurated in Ayrshire in 1867 and has taken place at Ayr since 1966.", "The home of Ms Sturgeon and Mr Murrell was searched for two days at the start of March\n\nPolice had to wait two weeks before they were given permission to raid the home of Nicola Sturgeon and her husband Peter Murrell, it has emerged.\n\nThe Crown Office was told on 20 March that Police Scotland wanted a search warrant.\n\nIt was not until 3 April - a week after the SNP leadership contest ended - that the application for a warrant was approved by a sheriff.\n\nOfficers searched the home of the former first minister two days later.\n\nDetails were released by Police Scotland in response to a Freedom of Information Request (FOI) by the Scottish Conservatives that was first reported by the Scottish Sun.\n\nSources close to the inquiry have denied that there was an undue delay.\n\nBut opposition parties said the revelation would \"raise eyebrows\" and questioned the role of Lord Advocate Dorothy Bain KC, who heads the Crown Office but is also a Scottish government minister.\n\nMs Bain did not answer when she was asked by Sky News whether the warrant had been deliberately delayed.\n\nA spokesman for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service said: \"In all matters, Scotland's prosecutors act independently of political pressure or interference.\"It is standard that any case regarding politicians is dealt with by prosecutors without the involvement of the Lord Advocate or Solicitor General.\"\n\nBBC Scotland understands that a draft search warrant was submitted by the police which the fiscal then discussed with officers before its contents were finalised.\n\nThe warrant, which is reported to have included a long list of items the police wanted to seize, was then signed by a sheriff on the same day it was finished.\n\nMr Murrell, who had quit as the SNP's chief executive on 18 March, was arrested when officers investigating the party's finances arrived at the Glasgow home he shares with Ms Sturgeon early on the morning of 5 April.\n\nSeveral boxes of evidence were removed from the SNP's headquarters in Edinburgh\n\nPolice spent two days searching the house, with several boxes of evidence being removed. Mr Murrell was released without charge pending further investigations.\n\nThe SNP's headquarters in Edinburgh was also searched on 5 April and a luxury motorhome that sells for about \u00a3110,000 was seized from outside the home of Mr Murrell's mother in Dunfermline.\n\nColin Beattie, who was the party's treasurer at the time, was arrested on 18 April before also being released without charge while further inquiries were carried out. He subsequently quit as treasurer.\n\nThe contest to succeed Ms Sturgeon as SNP leader and Scotland's first minister had ended on 27 March when Humza Yousaf, who was the party hierarchy's preferred candidate, narrowly defeated Kate Forbes.\n\nNewspaper reports earlier this year claimed that some people within Police Scotland were frustrated by the direction they were being given by the Crown Office on the SNP investigation.\n\nScottish Conservative MSP Russell Findlay told BBC Scotland: \"There has been this continual sense of something not feeling quite right and of some frustration being expressed not by journalists, not by politicians, but by police officers and this latest revelation perhaps only feeds into that sense.\n\n\"From what I understand the Crown Office is suggesting this was perfectly regular and routine, but the entire investigation is so sensitive and is subject to a huge amount of speculation and the more transparency there is around it the better.\"\n\nMr Findlay said the case also raised \"fundamental questions\" about the role of the Lord Advocate, who heads the independent prosecution service while also sitting as a minister in Scottish government cabinet meetings.\n\nHe added: \"It doesn't feel appropriate. And that separation needs to happen.\"\n\nJackie Baillie, the deputy leader of Scottish Labour, said the two-week delay was a \"very interesting revelation that will lead to raised eyebrows across Scotland\".\n\nShe added: \"While I accept that the Lord Advocate may not have had a direct influence on the timing, this story underlines why we need to have a serious discussion about separating the role of the Lord Advocate to ensure that no perception of conflict of interest can ever occur.\"\n\nAlba MP Kenny MacAskill, who served as justice secretary in the SNP government led by Alex Salmond, called for a judge-led inquiry into the Crown Office's role in the granting of the warrant to search Ms Sturgeon's house and the SNP HQ.\n\nHe said this would \"reassure the public that the decisions taken by the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service have not been influenced by political considerations\".\n\nPrivately, prosecutors and police are deeply frustrated by the latest headlines and vehemently deny that the SNP's leadership contest played any part in the timing of the searches.\n\nSome legal figures describe the two-week process to secure search warrants as unusually long.\n\nA senior lawyer who has worked with the Crown Office in the past said: \"It all depends on why it took two weeks. If it was for operational reasons, there's nothing wrong with that.\n\n\"If it was for further inquiries, there's nothing wrong with that. If it was for political reasons, to delay things, there's a lot wrong with that.\"\n\nOne source close to the inquiry said: \"The concept that there was a delay is misplaced. The decision was taken by a procurator fiscal with no political affiliation.\"\n\nGiven the apparent complexity of the investigation and the fact that the stakes are so high, it would be astonishing if prosecutors were not taking their time and the greatest of care.\n\nInevitably, in something like this, it's a case of \"damned if they do, damned if they don't\".\n\nPolice launched their Operation Branchform investigation almost two years ago after receiving complaints about how a total of \u00a3666,953 donated to the SNP by activists was used.\n\nThe party pledged to spend the funds on a future independence referendum. Questions were raised after its accounts showed it had just under \u00a397,000 in the bank at the end of 2019, and total net assets of about \u00a3272,000.\n\nLast year it emerged Mr Murrell gave a loan of more than \u00a3100,000 to the SNP to help it out with a \"cash flow\" issue after the last election.\n\nThe party had repaid about half of the money by October of that year. It still owes money to its former chief executive, but has not said how much.\n\nMs Sturgeon has previously said the police investigation played no part in her decision to announce on 15 February that she was standing down as SNP leader and first minister.\n\nShe also said the first she knew that the police wanted to search her home and arrest her husband was when detectives arrived on her doorstep.\n\nShe added: \"There are many questions that I would want to be able to answer and in the fullness of time I hope I will answer, but it would be wrong and inappropriate for me to go into any detail of what the police are currently investigating.\"", "Pouria Zeraati said he he is \"feeling better\" and recovering\n\nAn Iranian TV host stabbed in London has been discharged from hospital and says he is now staying in a safe place.\n\nIran International presenter Pouria Zeraati, 36, was repeatedly stabbed in an attack by a group outside his home in Wimbledon, south London, on Friday afternoon, his channel said.\n\nThe London-based station said it had faced \"heavy threats\" for 18 months.\n\nCounter-terrorism officers are leading the investigation. The Iranian regime has denied any involvement.\n\nMr Zeraati thanked well-wishers for their \"sympathy, kindness and love in the past few days\".\n\n\"Fortunately, I am feeling better, recovering and I have been discharged from the hospital,\" he posted on X.\n\n\"My wife and I are residing at a safe place under the supervision of the Met Police.\"\n\nMr Zeraati claimed the suspects in the attack had purposefully planned it.\n\nA neighbour, who wanted to remain anonymous, told BBC News an officer had spoken to them and said there were three attackers who ran up the road and were picked up.\n\nIran International says it provides independent coverage of events in the country, but the regime in Tehran has declared it a terrorist organisation.\n\nThe channel's spokesman told BBC Today programme on Saturday the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) had been targeting journalists and their families.\n\nAdam Baillie said: \"It was a shocking, shocking incident, whatever the outcome of an investigation reveals.\n\n\"But for him as a leading presenter, as with our other presenters and journalists, yes, it is a great shock.\n\n\"It's the first attack of its kind.\"\n\nIran's charge d'affaires in the UK, Mehdi Hosseini Matin, said \"we deny any link\" to the incident.\n\nMr Zeraati posted a picture on Instagram on Saturday, showing him smiling from his hospital bed.\n\nNo arrests have been made, the Metropolitan Police said.\n\nThe force said it was not yet able to provide further information about any motive behind the attack, but Mr Zeraati's occupation coupled with recent threats towards UK-based Iranian journalists meant the investigation was being led by specialist counter-terrorism officers.\n\nCdr Dominic Murphy, head of the Met's Counter Terrorism Command, said: \"I appreciate the concern this incident has caused, for local people as well as for those in similar lines of work and from Iranian communities.\"\n\nIn January, the Foreign Office announced sanctions against members of the IRGC's Unit 840 following an ITV investigation into plans to assassinate two of Iran International's presenters in the UK.\n\nAt the time, Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron said \"the Iranian regime and the criminal gangs who operate on its behalf pose an unacceptable threat to the UK's security\".\n\nIran International resumed its operations in London last September after temporarily moving its broadcasting studios to Washington DC in February 2023 because of a \"significant escalation in state-backed threats from Iran\".\n\nIn a separate case in December last year, Magomed-Husejn Dovtaev, a Chechen-born Austrian national, was jailed for three-and-a-half years for spying on Iran International before a \"planned attack\" on UK soil.\n\nThe Met Police said last year that since the start of 2020, 15 plots to either kidnap or kill UK-based individuals perceived as enemies of the Iranian regime had been foiled.\n\nNearly 18 months ago, Iran International became one of the main providers of news during a wave of anti-government protests in Iran.\n\nPouria Zeraati is the television host of the Last Word program on Iran International", "We are now ending our coverage of today's events in France after yesterday's knife attack at a playground in the eastern city of Annecy.\n\nTo read the latest on this story, head here.\n\nIf you need support after reading about these distressing events, you can find details of organisations which can help using BBC Action Line.\n\nToday's page was brought to you by our writers Laura Gozzi, Jack Burgess and Sam Hancock;

The point of raising interest rates is to reduce the amount people spend - so why does the Bank of England keep raising rates? Lots of people are asking the same question \u2013 for entirely understandable reasons. Why would the Bank of England raise rates, increasing the financial pain on those already suffering, knowing that the impact on prices could be limited? One answer is that the base rate is a blunt instrument, but pretty much the sharpest the Bank has. So, the committee has decided that a higher rate will dampen some non-essential spending, and bring down the rate of price rises (known as inflation). It may take some time. Clearly, the impact is that borrowing gets more expensive for millions of people. This may, or may not, be the end of the run of rate rises.

It looked almost fragile waiting for its royal occupant.\n\nYou could feel the sense of expectation. It was really happening right here, on an altar full of candlelight, prayers and a glow of gold. The Abbey was like being inside a jewel box.\n\nThe first Coronation in 70 years proved to be a sumptuous, seamless and often surreal ceremony.\n\nBefore 2,300 guests, King Charles and Queen Camilla went through the ancient rituals, with a twist of modern signals about diversity.\n\nBut it was also like a spectacularly lavish wedding, with friends, families and famous faces crowded into every corner of the church, playing with their phones, checking to see who else was there.\n\nAnd where else would international royalty, world leaders and 100 overseas heads of state get an opportunity to meet Ant and Dec?\n\nThe King is crowned in the 700-year-old Coronation chair\n\nThere were glamorous outfits and hats, splashes of military uniforms with epaulettes, plumes and swords, clerical robes and every shade and shape of national dress. The selfies on the way in were going to prove that they'd really been here.\n\nThere were traditional roles with baffling titles such as Bluemantle Pursuivant and Rouge Dragon Pursuivant and a number of men seemed to be entirely dressed in medieval flags.\n\nWalking down the nave when he arrived, the King seemed to be pausing to take it all in.\n\nWhat was he thinking, after all the decades that he'd been waiting for this day? Was he thinking about his mother, his own family, the responsibility?\n\nWhen the Archbishop of Canterbury appeared to give the crown a couple of twists on his head, the King might have been thinking less charitable thoughts.\n\nA guest in the Abbey takes a selfie with Ant and Dec\n\nAnd the only person who could have stolen the King's show was possibly Penny Mordaunt, the lord president of the council, who hovered around the high altar looking like a deity who had escaped from an ancient Greek urn.\n\nBut the King must have been delighted with the music, not least because he'd chosen it himself, like all of this elaborate ceremony. It was like a big work of art and he was its creator.\n\nAt close quarters in the abbey, the orchestra and choir were remarkable, the music welling up like a tidal wave of sound. It was bouncing off the stained glass windows.\n\nThe piece by William Byrd had all the aching melancholy and stillness that you suspect King Charles would really have enjoyed. Handel's Zadok the Priest, full of drama and anticipation, was a real spine-tingler.\n\nThere was also the most eclectic collection of people in the congregation. There were hundreds of charity workers, US First Lady Jill Biden, President Macron and rows of celebrities, such as Joanna Lumley, Maggie Smith, Stephen Fry, and hello, it's Lionel Ritchie.\n\nMany of the guests had been inside the abbey for hours before it started, which meant some of the best-dressed queues ever seen for the toilets. I'd never really thought about the mechanics of such a visit for a peer in floor-length robes and ermine.\n\nIt was a lavish and colourful spectacle in the Abbey\n\nThere had been stories about MPs complaining about a lack of tickets for the Coronation. Part of the problem might be there are now so many ex-PMs to accommodate. Even Liz Truss got a seat.\n\nBoris Johnson arrived looking like his shirt collars were staging their own backbench rebellion.\n\nThe current PM, Rishi Sunak, had a speaking part, delivering the Bible lesson.\n\nFor those hoping to watch any body language between Prince Harry and his brother Prince William, there was nothing to see, as they may as well have been sitting a continent apart.\n\nHarry arrived looking relaxed and chatty, despite this being a huge transatlantic flying visit, and was seated a couple of rows behind Prince William, the Prince of Wales.\n\nPrince Harry was heading back to the US straight after the service\n\nThe older brother, who must have been thinking that one day he'll face his own Coronation, was more engaged in his own role in the ceremony.\n\nThere seemed to be glances exchanged too between the husband and wife at the centre of this event, who were maybe having the big public wedding they didn't have before.\n\nKing Charles now has his Queen Camilla beside him. It took them about half an hour to get to the Abbey in the morning, but their journey to this point has taken them decades.\n\nIt's impossible to go into Westminster Abbey without feeling the weight of history on every side. It seeps from every plaque and statue. Even the clothes had a story. The King was wearing a robe that had been his grandfather's and Catherine was wearing earrings that had been Diana's.\n\nMany guests might have been remembering being here at the late Queen's funeral, which eight months ago went out through the same doors as today's newly-crowned couple.\n\nThe King and Queen left the Abbey in the Gold State Coach\n\nSuch grand occasions, snapshots for the history books, are where the past, present and future overlap.\n\nWith the music soaring and the guests on their feet, the King and Queen left the Abbey to step inside the crown-on-wheels that is the Gold State Coach, with umbrellas up against the rain.\n\nThe carriage pulled away, past a sea of waving camera phones, and another era had begun.", "Donald Trump is accused of pressuring an employee to delete security footage at his Florida home, in new criminal charges related to his alleged mishandling of classified files.\n\nThe latest indictment adds one count of wilful retention of defence information and two of obstruction, making 40 charges in total in this case.\n\nMr Trump denies any wrongdoing and has called the prosecutor \"deranged\".\n\nHe is fighting multiple legal cases as he runs for president again.\n\nIn a Friday morning interview, he reiterated that he would not end his 2024 campaign even if he is criminally convicted.\n\nMr Trump has pleaded not guilty to earlier charges in the case, alongside his personal aide Walt Nauta, who also received two additional charges of obstruction on Thursday.\n\nThe property manager at the former US president's Mar-a-Lago estate, Carlos de Oliveira, has also now been indicted.\n\nThe revised charge-sheet outlines alleged efforts between Mr Nauta and Mr de Oliveira to obstruct the justice department's investigation.\n\nAccording to the court document, they conspired in an effort to delete surveillance video after the Department of Justice issued a subpoena demanding footage of the area where it said confidential documents were held.\n\nProsecutors claim Mr de Oliveira twice told Mar-a-Lago's director of information technology that \"the boss\" wanted the server deleted, in a conversation he said must remain between them.\n\nThe IT worker responded that he did not believe he had the authority to do so, according to the indictment.\n\nThe employee, who is not named or charged in the indictment, has been identified as Yuscil Taveras.\n\nThe charge-sheet also describes a scene in which Mr de Oliveira \"walked through the bushes\" into a property adjacent to the Mar-a-Lago resort to meet Mr Nauta.\n\nLater, the court filing adds, Mr Trump phoned Mr de Oliveira and promised him legal counsel at Mr Nauta's request.\n\nA lawyer for Mr de Oliveira has declined to comment on the allegations.\n\nThe updated indictment also says that Mr Trump knowingly discussed a top-secret document with biographers visiting Mar-a-Lago to interview him.\n\nThe paper Mr Trump allegedly revealed to the biographers contained possible plans to attack \"Country A\", which refers to Iran.\n\n\"Look what I found... Isn't it amazing? I have a big pile of papers, this thing just came up.

Russia is taking back what belongs to it,\" added Anna, another Russian living in Germany.\n\nAlexander then showed me a cigarette holder and a tobacco box he had decorated by taping portraits of President Putin to them.\n\nBut the events that matter most to Russian speakers were held the following day, 9 May - marked in Russia as Victory Day.\n\nThey kicked off with the Russian ambassador laying flowers to the imposing statue of a Soviet soldier in Treptower Park. Again, the event mostly attracted supporters of the Kremlin's policies and rhetoric.\n\nOne of them, a young Russian called Yevgenia, told me that \"the collective West, particularly America\" were fanning the flames of neo-Nazism in Ukraine.\n\nYevgenia was sporting the St George's Ribbon - a Kremlin-backed symbol often used by Russian troops fighting in Ukraine. Like many at the rally, she and her friend held aloft a Soviet flag, as Russian flags were banned.\n\nYevgenia (right) wears a St George's Ribbon - a Kremlin-backed symbol used by Russian troops in the Ukraine war\n\nBut not everyone supported such views.\n\nThe monument to the grieving mother at the other end of Treptower Park was the meeting point for those who wanted to honour the victims of fascism without supporting Mr Putin's claims that he is fighting \"fascists\" in Ukraine.\n\nAnd many of the people who gathered there were Russians. One of them, Kirill, told me he fled Russia last October to avoid being drafted into the army and being sent to fight in Ukraine.\n\n\"I do not want to become a murderer for Putin. I do not believe the lies I'm told by TV,\" he said.\n\n\"I was very afraid, but I attended anti-war rallies. I did all I could do,\" Kirill told me, standing alongside a poster about political prisoners in Russia.\n\nKirill, with a poster of political prisoners in Russia, says he left the country to avoid being drafted into the Russian army\n\nKirill fled Russia after being arrested, fined and beaten for attending anti-war rallies in St Petersburg.\n\nAnother young Russian in this corner of Treptower Park, an activist called Alexandra, thought President Putin had turned Victory Day into a propaganda tool. \"It is an absolute sacrilege for us,\" she told me.\n\nHer friend Ekaterina chimed in: \"It is important for me to show that not everyone from Russia supports what is happening in Ukraine or what this day has turned into.\n\n\"The way it is marked now is a one big reason why this war started on 24 February last year.\"\n\nAt another important event held by Russians in Berlin on Victory Day, dozens gathered at the Brandenburg Gate for what is known as the march of the Immortal Regiment.\n\nEven though such marches are encouraged by the Kremlin, the one held in Berlin seemed less overly political than the events in Treptower Park, with dozens of Russians solemnly carrying photographs of their ancestors who fought in World War Two.\n\nA group of anti-war Russians demonstrated against Victory Day being turned into a propaganda tool - but their event was outnumbered by the rally sporting Kremlin-encouraged symbols such as St George's ribbons or Soviet flags.\n\nKristina attends a demonstration with a sign criticising the West's supply of weapons to Ukraine\n\nBut what do Germans think of all this?\n\nI was able to find the whole spectrum of opinions among them. Many came to Treptower Park on 8-9 May to offer thanks for the Soviet army liberating Germany from fascism, and were less concerned with the present.\n\n\"What Putin is doing in Ukraine now doesn't change the fact that [Russia did liberate Germany],\" one of them, Wolfgang, told me.\n\nAnother German demonstrator, Kristina, was against weapons deliveries to what she described as the \"fascist regime\" in Ukraine.\n\nBut a young man, Janek, said it was \"shameful\" that President Putin was using the defeat of Nazism as a foreign policy tool.\n\n\"They say they want to free Ukrainians from the Nazis there - but it's just not true, it's propaganda,\" he said.", "A girl has died after a Land Rover crashed into a primary school in Wimbledon, south-west London, on Thursday morning.\n\nThe driver, a woman in her 40s, has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving.\n\nPolice say they are not treating the crash as terror-related.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

The record for the payment describes it as \"legal fees\" and prosecutors could argue this amounts to Mr Trump falsifying business records.\n\nThat is a misdemeanour in New York, typically resolved with a fine. But legal analysts say it could be upgraded to a more serious felony charge, which carries prison time, if prosecutors argue the lie was used in order to violate campaign laws.\n\nThe former president denies any wrongdoing and says he never had an affair with Ms Daniels.\n\nA grand jury was convened in January to determine whether there is enough evidence to indict Mr Trump.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nOn Monday, the grand jury heard from a Trump ally named Robert Costello who was called by the Trump team to undermine the prosecution's star witness, Cohen.\n\nMr Costello told reporters after emerging from two hours of testimony: \"I told the grand jury that this guy [Cohen] couldn't tell the truth if you put a gun to his head.\"\n\nHe claimed Cohen, whom he used to work with, had once told him that Mr Trump was not aware of the payment to Ms Daniels.\n\nAfter Mr Costello's testimony on Monday, Cohen hit back, saying that Mr Costello \"lacks any sense of veracity\".\n\nCohen was jailed in 2018 for multiple offences including violating campaign finance laws by not declaring the payment to Ms Daniels. Mr Trump has said he only learned of the payment much later.\n\nIn a post on his Truth Social platform on Tuesday, Mr Trump said: \"In the history of our Country there cannot have been a more damaged or less credible witness at trial than fully disbarred lawyer and felon, Michael Cohen.\"\n\nThe jury is expected to hear from at least one more witness on Wednesday before any charges are filed.\n\nMr Trump has vowed to continue his campaign for the 2024 presidential nomination even if he is indicted.\n\nBut 44% of Republicans said he should drop out of the presidential race if charged, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found on Monday.\n\nTrump supporters have held protests outside his New York and Florida homes", "The \"Barry Award\" had been named in honour of Barry Humphries\n\nOne of the world's top comedy festivals will no longer use comedian Barry Humphries' name for its chief prize, after he was accused of transphobia.\n\nThe Melbourne International Comedy Festival said its prestigious Barry Award for best show would be renamed.\n\nHumphries, best known for his character Dame Edna Everage, has repeatedly drawn anger for his comments on transgender people - and later defended himself.\n\nHis remarks had \"definitely played a part\" in the change, the festival said.\n\nHumphries, 85, has not responded to the festival's decision.\n\nLast year, he drew criticism for describing being transgender as \"a fashion\".\n\nIn another controversy, he claimed to have been speaking in character when he referred to gender-reassignment surgery as \"self-mutilation\" in a 2016 interview with The Telegraph. He also described Caitlyn Jenner as a \"publicity-seeking rat-bag\".\n\nHe has previously said his comments were misinterpreted, but they have been criticised by other high-profile comedians - including former Barry Award winner Hannah Gadsby.\n\nBarry Humphries claimed he was in character as Dame Edna in a 2016 interview\n\nHumphries co-founded the Melbourne International Comedy Festival in 1987, and it is now one of the world's premier comedy events. Its top prize has been named in his honour since 2000.\n\nOn Tuesday, festival director Susan Provan said in a statement: \"It is time for the award for most outstanding show to be in our name to celebrate the city that inspired the growth of our festival and its outstanding artists.\"\n\nShe told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that Humphries' recent comments were \"not helpful\" and had helped instigate the decision.\n\nGadsby criticised Humphries when she accepted the award in 2017 for her show Nanette, now a worldwide success on Netflix.\n\n\"I don't agree with a lot of the things Barry Humphries has said recently,\" she said at the time.\n\n\"It is not something I will walk past.

The statement from the special prosecutors says the charges against her remain unchanged.\n\nA lawyer for Ms Gutierrez-Reed told BBC News that they \"fully expect at the end of this process that Hannah will also be exonerated\".\n\nAccording to the LA Times, prosecutors had recently learned that the gun used in the shooting, a .45 Colt revolver, had been modified with a new trigger in a way that could have made a misfire more likely.\n\nThursday's statement by prosecutors made no mention of the gun, but said that the newly revealed facts \"demand further investigation and forensic analysis\".\n\nProsecutors had accused Mr Baldwin, 65, of showing a \"reckless\" disregard for the safety of his colleagues.\n\nMr Nikas, a lawyer for the star of The Hunt for Red October, previously called the initial decision to charge his client \"a terrible miscarriage of justice\".\n\n\"Mr Baldwin had no reason to believe there was a live bullet in the gun - or anywhere on the movie set,\" Mr Nikas said.\n\n\"He relied on the professionals with whom he worked, who assured him the gun did not have live rounds.\"\n\nIn an Instagram post after the announcement was made, the 30 Rock actor thanked his lawyer and his wife, Hilaria Baldwin.\n\n\"I owe everything I have to this woman. (and to you, Luke),\" he posted.\n\nIn order to have been found guilty prosecutors would have had to convince a jury that he had acted with \"criminal negligence\".\n\nIf convicted, he could have faced up to 18 months in prison.\n\nThe Santa Fe district attorney had initially added a firearm enhancement charge, which could have added five years to his sentence.\n\nBut it was dropped after prosecutors determined that the enhancement law was not in place at the time of the shooting.\n\nThe decision to drop the charges comes on the same day that Rust resumed filming - 18 months after the shooting.\n\nMelina Spadone, a lawyer for Rust Movie Productions, said new rules on the set \"will bar any use of working weapons and any form of ammunition\".\n\n\"Live ammunition is - and always was - prohibited on set.\"\n\nAccording to Variety magazine, Mr Baldwin is currently filming Rust on location in Montana.\n\nHutchins' widower, Matthew, will be an executive producer. Baldwin last October reached a settlement in a wrongful death lawsuit brought by her family.\n\nRust Movie productions, which Baldwin is part of, said in February the scene that was being rehearsed when Hutchins was shot has now been rewritten.", "The stark, emotional video for Nothing Compares 2 U was an MTV staple in 1990\n\nIn 1990, Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor scored a worldwide hit with Nothing Compares 2 U, a song of unspeakable loss and heartbreak.\n\nIt was the defining moment of her career - one that thrust her unwillingly into the mainstream.\n\nBut the story of the video, and how she came to record it, is full of surprising twists and turns.\n\nAfter her death at the age of 56, here's a closer look at how she recorded her most famous song.\n\nIt's 15 July, 1984 and Prince has just flown back from Dallas, where he watched the Jacksons' Victory tour. As soon as he steps off the plane, he heads to the recording studio.\n\nThere, with only his engineer Susan Rogers in attendance, he writes and records the initial version of Nothing Compares 2 U in a matter of hours.\n\n\"I was amazed at how beautiful it was,\" Rogers told Duane Tudahl, in his book Prince & The Purple Rain studio sessions.\n\n\"He took his notebook and he went off to the bedroom, wrote the lyrics very quickly, came back out and sang it. I was very impressed with it.\"\n\nRogers theorised that the song was written about Prince's housekeeper, Sandy Scipioni, who had been forced to quit when her father died unexpectedly of a heart attack.\n\n\"Sandy was the person who made sure he had his favourite beverage, which was Five Alive, and she made sure the house was clean, and that there were fresh flowers on the piano, and that the socks and underwear were washed,\" Rogers told BBC 6 Music in 2018.\n\n\"She had been gone and Prince's mood was getting darker and darker. He would just ask, 'When is Sandy coming back?' That might have been the inspiration for the song.\"\n\nPrince's friend, Jerome Benton, had a different story - saying Prince wrote the song for him after he split up with his fianc\u00e9e.\n\nEither way, the musician felt the song didn't suit his public image at the time. He decided to give it away to The Family, a band he'd formed around his then-girlfriend Susannah Melvoin, and the singer Paul Peterson.\n\nPrince removed his vocals, added some orchestral overdubs and handed the song over. It was released on The Family's sole album in 1985, which promptly tanked, and the group split up.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Prince's engineer Susan Rogers and The Family's St Paul Peterson speak to BBC 6 Music\n\nNothing Compares 2 U was never released as a single, and seemed destined for obscurity until Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor's manager, Fachtna O'Ceallaigh, remembered it and suggested she cover it for her second album, I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got.\n\nOther accounts suggest she was introduced to the song by Steve Fargnoli, who had looked after Prince in the Purple Rain era, and took over as O'Connor's manager around the time of the recording.\n\nEither way, O'Connor immediately connected with the track. She and O'Ceallaigh were a couple, but their relationship was on the rocks. Prince's lovelorn lyrics matched her own state of mind. If he was gone, she could do whatever she wanted, she could see whomever she chose - but nothing would compare to him.\n\n\"They were in the process of breaking up when we recorded Nothing Compares 2 U,\" said Chris Birkett, who co-produced and engineered the song, in an interview with Sound On Sound.\n\n\"That's probably why she did such a good vocal. She came into the studio, did it in one take, double-tracked it straight away and it was perfect because she was totally into the song. It mirrored her situation.\"\n\nAt this point, it's a good idea to go and listen to The Family's original recording or Prince's demo, which was released in 2018. The song is there, but it's all dressed up in Paisley finery. Every line ends with a baroque piano figure, the bridge is drowning in syrupy strings, there's even a saxophone solo.\n\nWhatever emotion Prince was channelling, he did his best to hide it. O'Connor did the opposite.\n\nWorking with Japanese jazz virtuoso Gota Yashiki and Soul II Soul producer Nellee Hooper, she put a line through all the ornate R&B flourishes and pared the song back its bare essentials.\n\nThe arrangement is simple - a drum loop, some gauzy strings and a haunting choir of backing vocals. They're pushed and pulled by the tidal wave of her voice, like sand on a beach, as she wrestles with various stages of devastation.\n\nShe starts quietly, almost cowering as she sings: \"It's been seven hours and 15 days since you took your love away.\" Then she's defiant: \"Since you been gone, I can do whatever I want\" but her bravado collapses into anguish once she realises that \"nothing will take away these blues\".\n\nBy the chorus, she's face to face with grief. Her voice strives for power, but it cracks again. Then, In a change to Prince's melody, she shifts the pitch of the final \"to you\" to a despondent monotone, the dissonance illustrating her pain.\n\nIt's one of the all-time great vocal performances.\n\nO'Connor's other hits include Mandinka, I Am Stretched On Your Grave and Thank You For Hearing Me\n\nIn O'Connor's hands, Nothing Compares 2 U was always going to be a hit, but the video made it a phenomenon.\n\nDirector John Maybury shot several hours of footage of the singer walking through a washed-out Paris. You can see glimpses of it in the finished promo - O'Connor dressed in black, reflected in the Seine, walking through the stunning Parc de Saint-Cloud.\n\nBut once she'd performed the song to the camera, Maybury knew her close-up had to be the focus.\n\nFrom the beginning, O'Connor stares straight at us, her pale green eyes peering out of the screen, searching for connection. But as she sings, she breaks eye contact, glancing down, as though she's unable to keep her emotions in check.\n\nAt the end, famously, two tears roll down her cheeks.\n\nThose tears were genuine, and they represented a loss Prince could never have imagined when he wrote Nothing Compares 2 U in the middle of his Purple Rain hot streak.\n\nO'Connor's mother had died in a car crash in 1986, when the singer was still a teenager. They had not had an easy relationship. O'Connor later accused her of being mentally and physically abusive. But when she sang Prince's final verse, all that grief came flooding back.\n\n\"All the flowers that you planted, mama, in the back yard / All died when you went away/ I know that living with you, baby, was sometimes hard / But I'm willing to give it another try.\"\n\nThat's the moment that prompted those tears.\n\n\"I didn't know I was going to cry when I sang in the video because I didn't cry in the studio recording it,\" she later recalled.\n\n\"[But] every time I sing that song I think of my mother. I never stop crying for my mother. I couldn't face being in Ireland for 13 years because of it.\"\n\nThis YouTube post cannot be displayed in your browser.

In her 2021 memoir, she said he told her off for swearing in interviews, then challenged her to a pillow fight, only to bash her with something hard he'd slipped into his pillowcase.\n\nDespite that, she still held Nothing Compares 2U in great reverence,\n\n\"It's really about emotions, it's not about notes,\" she told BBC 6 Music in 2016.\n\n\"I think I'm probably similar to millions of people who loved the song, and we're all people who associated the song with a loss of some kind.\"", "The High Court ruled that some lawsuits had been submitted too late to proceed\n\nHugh Grant is set to take the Sun newspaper on in court over claims it used illegal methods to gather stories about him.\n\nThe actor believes private investigators working for the Sun tapped his phone, bugged his house and car, and burgled his home.\n\nThe Sun's publisher News Group Newspapers (NGN) unsuccessfully argued his action should be blocked because he waited too long to launch it.\n\nNGN denies the claims against it.\n\nA judge was asked to rule on whether Mr Grant's lawsuit should be allowed to proceed because it dates back further than six years, the cut-off point for legal action of this kind in civil courts.\n\nThis time limitation has become a major legal battleground in cases against newspapers, because allegations of wrongdoing often go back 30 years.\n\nPublishers attempt to argue that cases should not go to trial because alleged victims of unlawful newsgathering delayed their legal action.\n\nBut Mr Grant argued he should be allowed to bring the case now because material he and his lawyers will rely on only came to light in recent years.\n\nSome of the evidence against the newspaper was contained in a 2021 witness statement made by private investigator Gavin Burrows.\n\nIt was only when NGN disclosed invoices for their payments to Mr Burrows around the same time that Mr Grant had access to potential evidence which could help him win his case in court.\n\nIn his judgement, Mr Justice Fancourt acknowledged that the 62-year-old actor and privacy campaigner had long believed that private investigators had been paid to look into his affairs.\n\nThe judge said there was a realistic chance Mr Grant would establish at trial that, before seeing the 2021 evidence, \"he could not reasonably have believed with sufficient confidence that he may have been targeted by [private investigators] instructed by the Sun\".\n\nThis judgment does not mean the issue of whether Mr Grant's claim is too late has been decided, but it will now be considered at the trial next year.\n\nIn a statement released through his lawyer, Mr Grant said: \"I am pleased that my case will be allowed to go to trial, which is what I have always wanted - because it is necessary that the truth comes out about the activities of the Sun.\n\n\"As my case makes clear, the allegations go far wider and deeper than voicemail interception.\"\n\nMr Grant's statement in the case claims that for years newspaper published News UK lied about its involvement in phone hacking and illegal information gathering.\n\nHe said the company had a \"vast, long-lasting and deliberate policy strategy plan of false denials and other concealment in relation to the Sun, to prevent me, and others in a similar position, from bringing claims against them\".\n\nThis included, he said, false denials to the Leveson Inquiry into Press Standards, a press complaints body, and in public statements.\n\nWhile the actor was successful in securing his day in court on part of his claim, the court refused Mr Grant permission to sue NGN for allegedly hacking his phone voicemails, as the judge ruled he could have brought a case much earlier.\n\nNGN said it was \"pleased that, following our application, the High Court has ruled that Mr Grant is statute-barred from bringing a phone hacking claim against The Sun.\"\n\n\"NGN strongly denies the various historical allegations of unlawful information gathering contained in what remains of Mr Grant's claim.\"\n\nA similar legal argument centred on the claims of the Duke of Sussex is due to be heard by the High Court in July.", "Taylor Swift will be performing in Cardiff next June\n\nTickets for Taylor Swift's 2024 Cardiff gig are already being listed for \u00a33,352 on resale websites.\n\nLabour MP Kevin Brennan expressed his shock in the Parliament, saying his daughter was a \"Swiftie\".\n\nHe asked Commons leader Penny Mordaunt why the UK government \"hasn't done more to protect our daughters from this sort of rip-off merchants\".\n\nMs Mordaunt encouraged him to \"raise that matter with the Secretary of State\" before the summer recess.\n\nThe US superstar will perform at the Principality Stadium on 18 June 2024 as part of her Eras Tour.\n\nThe MP may avoid a cruel summer as Ms Mordaunt told him there was one further Department for Culture, Media and Sport questions before the recess.\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

The road has been subject to regular blockades since 2022.\n\nThe demonstration was called to denounce the Dutch government's tax concessions for companies connected to the fossil fuel industry, including the energy firm, Shell, and the airline, KLM.\n\nActivists hoped to pile pressure on the government ahead of a planned debate about fossil fuel subsidies in June.\n\nExtinction Rebellion organisers say this is the 37th time they have protested on the A12 highway\n\nFlanked by fellow activists, Ms Thunberg marched towards the designated protest spot behind a banner with the words, STOP FOSSIL SUBSIDIES.\n\nThe world's most recognizable climate activist tried to blend in with the crowd, but her star-power meant this demonstration attracted more attention than previous XR blockades of the A12 highway.\n\nA brass band played and the protesters sang traditional Dutch songs given a modern climate-conscious twist.\n\nSome newspapers had claimed local residents were annoyed the climate protest was taking place on the hottest day of the year so far, potentially making it harder for people to reach the beach in The Hague.\n\nA group of activists then marched from the city centre to a field next to the highway, where a wall of local police officers was waiting for them.\n\nA few demonstrators broke through police lines but were quickly picked up and handcuffed.\n\n\"It's important to demonstrate today because we are living in a state of planetary emergency,\" Ms Thunberg told AFP news agency.\n\n\"We must do everything to avoid that crisis and to save human lives.\"\n\nAsked whether she was concerned about police action, she said: \"Why should I be?\"\n\nMs Thunberg was among a small group of climate activists who broke away and managed to reach the road. More than a hundred of them were placed in police-commandeered minibuses.\n\nThe Swedish activist described her arrest as 'peaceful'. She sat at the back and chatted before being driven away.\n\nAt previous protests in The Hague, police have driven detainees away from a protest's epicentre and released them without further consequences.\n\nThose, including Ms Thunberg, who managed to separate from the colourful crowd and sit down cross-legged on the A12 highway, were first asked by police if they wanted to cooperate by boarding the buses. Those who refused were hoisted up by arms and rucksacks and deposited in the vehicles.\n\nGreta Thunberg was loaded into a bus and driven away from the protest, along with fellow detainees\n\nLater on Saturday, reports emerged that Ms Thunberg had returned to the protest and been arrested for a second time.\n\nPolice told the BBC some people who were arrested and released were then arrested again. They did not confirm if Ms Thunberg was among them.\n\nAs of about 14:00 local time (12:00 GMT), traffic was still flowing on the A12, according to the Netherlands' Algemeen Dagblad newspaper.\n\nThe Hague's local police told the BBC: \"While we can't comment on individual cases, we can confirm that all of the people who were picked up by police and put on to minibuses were officially arrested, because they were blocking the highway and that is against the law.\"\n\nMs Thunberg has been a leading climate campaigner since she was 15 years old.\n\nIn February, she and four co-defendants were found not guilty of breaking the law when they refused to follow police instructions during a climate demonstration in London.", "Timothy Schofield has been found guilty of 11 sexual offences involving a child\n\nThe brother of television presenter Phillip Schofield has been found guilty of sexually abusing a boy.\n\nTimothy Schofield, 54, from Bath denied 11 sexual offences involving a child between October 2016 and October 2019.\n\nSchofield, who was a civilian worker for Avon and Somerset Police at the time of the offences, was found guilty of all charges.\n\nPhillip Schofield said after the verdict: \"As far as I am concerned, I no longer have a brother.\"\n\nThe jury at Exeter Crown Court found him guilty with a majority of 10-2 after more than five-and-a-half hours' deliberating.\n\nIn a statement released by his lawyer, Phillip Schofield said his brother had committed a \"despicable\" crime.\n\n\"My overwhelming concern is and has always been for the wellbeing of the victim and his family. I hope that their privacy will now be respected.\"\n\nSchofield arrived each day in court covering his head\n\nDuring the trial, Timothy Schofield denied performing sexual acts on the boy but admitted he had watched pornography with the teenager and they had masturbated while sitting apart.\n\nThe jury previously heard how he had confessed to his TV star brother in September 2021 about watching pornography with the teenager on one occasion, claiming it had happened after the boy was 16, the age of consent.\n\nPhillip Schofield described in a written statement read to the court how his brother had phoned him in an agitated and upset state, and Mr Schofield had invited him to drive to his home in London.\n\nHe told how his brother said \"You are going to hate me for what I am about to say\", with him assuring him there was nothing he could say that would do that.\n\nMr Schofield said in the statement: \"Then he said that he and [the boy] had time together and that last year they had watched porn ... and [masturbated]\".\n\n\"I turned and said, 'What did you just say?' He said it was last year and we were alone together. Tim said it was just this once. I told him it should never happen again.

It is expected to announce another 0.25% increase this week.\n\nThe moves are impacting the US economy, which could hurt banks as businesses and households start to struggle to make debt payments.\n\nMany analysts are worried about risks to banks lurking in the commercial property sector, which has been hit by a fall in demand for office space due to the expansion of remote work.\n\nThe rise in interest rates has put some banks in a bind, as higher rates hurt the market value of some debts issued when borrowing costs were lower.\n\nThe fears intensified in March, when panic sparked by the sudden collapse of Silicon Valley Bank - then the US's 16th largest lender - prompted global sell-offs of bank shares and led many US bank customers to shift their money to firms seen as safer.\n\nBigger banks proved to be the winners, while regional firms came under pressure.\n\nThe fears claimed Signature Bank and ultimately First Republic, which could not survive the loss of funds.\n\nPacWest reported last month that its deposits shrunk 16% from the end of December to the end of March, while Western Alliance shares fell 11%.\n\nBoth banks said they had seen deposits start to increase again more recently as the fears subsided.\n\nJamie Dimon, chief executive of JP Morgan Chase, which bought First Republic from the government, said on Monday that he thought the fall of First Republic marked the end to \"this part\" of the crisis.\n\n\"This part of the crisis is over,\" he said. \"Down the road, there are rates going way up, real estate, recession - that's a whole different issue, but for now, everyone should just take a deep breath.\"\n\nAnalysts have said the US banking system - which has more than 4,000 banks - could be poised for a wave of consolidation as the economy weakens.\n\nThey have compared the situation to the 1980s, when hundreds of lenders closed after being caught off guard by a sharp rise in interest rates and bad commercial property loans.\n\n\"It's primarily been an interest rate problem but if we slide into a recession, it could be a double whammy,\" said banking consultant Bert Ely.\n\n\"I think maybe heads are screwed on a little bit better than they were in the 80s but there's still lots of uncertainty that's out there.\"", "Police moved to arrest a group of protesters in Piccadilly as the annual Pride parade got under way\n\nFive Just Stop Oil protesters have been charged over demonstrations which briefly led to London's annual Pride parade being delayed.\n\nImages on social media on Saturday showed police removing demonstrators who managed to briefly stop the march.\n\nSeven people were arrested by the Metropolitan Police. Five have since been charged and two have been bailed.\n\nThe five people, aged between 20 and 68, have been charged with Public Order offences.\n\nThey are due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Tuesday.\n\nPolice said the five charged are Ben Plumpton, 68, of Underbank Ave, Charlestown, Calderdale; Zosia Lewis, 22, of Melbourne Street, Newcastle upon Tyne; Oliver Clegg, 20, of Olney Street, Manchester; Gosse Bootsma, 25, of no fixed address, and Callum Goode, 23, of Ashbourne, Derbyshire.\n\nOrganisers estimated about 30,000 participants from across 600 organisations took part in the parade\n\nIn addition, two males, aged 19 and 22 have been released on bail pending further enquiries, the Met added.\n\nThis year's Pride procession started at midday at Hyde Park Corner and people peacefully made their way through Westminster's streets before it finished at Whitehall Place.\n\nA number of stages hosted performances from LGBTQ+ acts as part of the celebrations.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "Taylor Swift has joined Elon Musk as ranking among the world's wealthiest people, according to a new rich list.\n\nThe American pop star entered the Forbes World's Billionaires List for the first time with $1.1bn (\u00a3877m), along with Sam Altman, creator of the AI chatbot ChatGPT on $1bn (\u00a3800m).\n\nLVMH French luxury goods titan Bernard Arnault and his family topped the chart with an estimated $233bn (\u00a3185bn).\n\nForbes said there were a record 2,781 billionaires for 2024.\n\nThe figure is 141 more than last year and 26 more than the previous record set in 2021. Forbes added the elite were richer than ever - with a collective wealth of $14.2tn (\u00a311.3tn).\n\nSinger-songwriter Swift entered the rich list after achieving megastar status. She stole the show at this year's Grammy Awards, becoming the first performer to win the prize for album of the year four times.\n\nHer album 1989 (Taylor's Version) was also the best-selling vinyl LP of last year.\n\nSwift's success is not just confined to the world of music. Her mere presence at American football games to watch her boyfriend Travis Kelce has been credited with raising NFL viewing figures.\n\nWhen it comes to the top 10 richest people on the planet, eight listed were from the US - six of whom had made their money in technology industries.\n\nAfter Frenchman Mr Arnault and his family, Mr Musk, the owner of Tesla and X, formerly Twitter, is listed second, with an estimated net worth of $195bn (\u00a3155bn).\n\nHe is followed in third by Amazon owner Jeff Bezos.\n\nMr Musk's riches are up 8% from last year but down on his net worth in November 2021, when he became the first person ever to be worth $300bn (\u00a3239bn).\n\nAlso joining Forbes's list is basketball legend Magic Johnson with wealth of $1.2bn (\u00a3950m) and TV producer Dick Wolf, behind the US Law and Order and Chicago PD series, also on $1.2bn.\n\nChase Peterson-Withorn, senior editor on wealth for Forbes, said it had been an \"amazing\" year for the world's richest people.\n\n\"A record-breaking 14 centi-billionaires have 12-figure fortunes. Even during times of financial uncertainty for many, the super-rich continue to thrive,\" he added.\n\nForbes said the class of billionaires for 2024 were 255% richer than a decade ago, now worth $2tn (\u00a31.59tn) in all, meaning just 0.5% of the world's 2,781 billionaires hold 14% of all billionaire wealth.\n\nGeographically, the US still has more billionaires than any other country, with a record 813 on the list. China remains second, followed by India.\n\nIn the UK, hedge fund manager Michael Platt is the richest person, followed by part-owner of Manchester United Sir Jim Ratcliffe and inventor Sir James Dyson.\n\nForbes said 189 people had fallen off the list including 129 from mainland China, where weak consumer spending and a collapse in the real estate market wiped billions off portfolios.\n\nAnother 32 billionaires died, including Egyptian tycoon Mohamed Al-Fayed, former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, former Chilean President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era and Margaritaville singer Jimmy Buffett.", "One care home in Scotland is closing every week on average, industry leaders have warned.\n\nScottish Care, which represents private operators, said the industry was in an \"incredibly difficult\" position due to funding and staffing challenges.\n\nAnd smaller, family-run homes in rural areas are the most vulnerable to closure, the body added.\n\nA new funding deal between care homes and council umbrella body Cosla has been agreed.\n\nBut care homes argue the 6% uplift does not go far enough to cover increased energy and recruitment costs.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC Scotland Sunday Show, Karen Hedge, deputy chief executive of Scottish Care, said the deal was the best Cosla could realistically offer but still \"doesn't cut it\".\n\nShe said: \"It is incredibly difficult right now, I'm having phone calls from our members in tears who are having to close what has been a family business for them for many years.\n\n\"What we are seeing as a result of that is the impact on the residents and their loved ones, who in some places are having to drive up to two hours to go to another care home in a different community.\"\n\nAs well as more homes closing, Ms Hedge said care at home packages were also being impacted by private operators not being able to meet the increased costs in what she described as another example of \"the way social care is a Cinderella service compared to the NHS\".\n\nAdam Stachura, head of policy and communications at Age Scotland, said the care home closure figures \"should be setting alarm bells ringing across the country\".\n\nHe added: \"Social care is critical to the lives of hundreds of thousands of people - it is incredibly worrying and I actually don't understand how it will get better.\n\n\"The vast majority of care homes are provided by private organisations, there are very few council-run care homes any more.\n\n\"So one closing every week is devastating because where on earth do these people go?\"\n\nThe National Care Home Contract (NCHC) was set up about 15 years ago in response to disputes over rates between care homes, local and central government.\n\nThose fees are now set through annual negotiation between Scottish Care and Cosla, which represents local authorities.\n\nA 6% uplift has been agreed but some in the industry say this was borne out of sheer desperation for more funding to keep going.\n\nPlans for a new national care service in Scotland, which would see a series of regional care boards set up that would operate in the same way as health boards, have been postponed.\n\nThe new service would see Scottish government ministers directly responsible for social care services instead of local councils.\n\nHowever, uncertainty about the costs involved in setting up and running the new service and the implications for local decision-making remain.\n\nA Scottish government spokesman said: \"The national care home rate is not set by the Scottish government and is negotiated by Cosla and Scottish Care.\n\n\"We are pleased that Scottish Care members have agreed to accept the 6% uplift offer from Cosla to agree the national care home contract.\"", "Activists on both sides of the abortion debate outside the Supreme Court\n\nLess than a year after its landmark decision reversing constitutional abortion protections, a majority of the nine justices of the US Supreme Court seem reluctant to jump back into the politically charged subject anytime soon.\n\nThe court was reviewing a decision by a federal judge in Texas that suspended approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the abortion drug mifepristone, one of the most commonly used methods of terminating a pregnancy in America.\n\nThe court threw out that decision, as well as a ruling by a federal appeals court that would have limited use of the drug to women less than seven weeks pregnant, and required three in-person physician visits for those seeking the drug, and prevented its availability by post.\n\nThe court's ruling was short and to the point. The current rules governing mifepristone remain in effect until the Supreme Court eventually does decide on the merits of the original Texas order, or (less likely) lets whatever the appeals court decides stand without review.\n\nThis effectively kicks the can down the road months and possibly well into 2024, when a final court decision could come down in the shadow of the next presidential election.\n\nTwo justices, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, openly dissented from the majority. The latter went into detail on why he would have let the Fifth Circuit's appeal court's ruling stand.\n\nHe wrote that the circuit court's stay would not have caused \"irreparable harm\" to the FDA or to Danco Laboratories, which manufactures the drug.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Why anti-abortion campaigners still march after Roe was overturned\n\nNeither Mr Alito nor the majority decision expressed any opinion about mifepristone's ultimate fate. Given the conservative-leaning court's abortion ruling last year, however, its final decision in the case could very well anger the abortion-rights groups that on Friday were celebrating.\n\nThe case is now back in the hands of the Fifth Circuit appeals court, where six of its 16 judges were appointed by Donald Trump and only four by Democratic presidents.\n\nLast week, two Trump-selected judges on that court issued a lengthy opinion that, among other things, said it was \"unlikely\" that the challenge to at least some of the FDA's decisions authorising mifepristone would fail. A third judge (appointed by former Republican President George W Bush) disagreed.\n\nThose three judges will hear oral arguments in the case in May and could issue a decision weeks or even months later. That ruling could then be reviewed by the full 15-judge circuit before the losing side has the opportunity to appeal to the US Supreme Court.\n\nThere is a likelihood that when this case once again lands on the steps of the high court, it will do so with a ruling that curtails the availability of the abortion drug.\n\nEven that, however, could be just the beginning.\n\nThis current legal battle is just over a temporary hold on the FDA's mifepristone approval. Once this round of appeals has concluded, the case will head back to the Texas court for a trial on the merits of the case, possibly with witness testimony.\n\nAfter that court issues its final decision, the appeals process will start all over again.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nMeanwhile, the opinion of the general public continues to land heavily in favour of existing policies relating to the abortion pill. A recent Ipsos poll found 68% of Americans opposed overturning approval of the abortion drug versus only 28% in favour. Republican voters were split, with 53% in favour and 46% opposed.\n\nA majority of Americans view the Supreme Court sceptically when it comes to abortion, with 57% saying the chamber is politically motivated on the topic, while only 37% trust that the justices will remain \"neutral and impartial\".\n\nFriday's order may allow some of those emotions, and attitudes towards the court, to cool in the coming months. But the court's abortion ruling last June has opened the door to numerous legal challenges to state-level abortion rights and restrictions, as well as to federal policies like the mifepristone rules.\n\nMr Alito, in his opinion last June, wrote that \"it is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people's elected representatives\", but this is far from the last time the nine justices will have to weigh in on the matter.", "More seasonal workers will be allowed into the UK if needed, the prime minister has said after the home secretary said migration must fall.\n\nRishi Sunak told a gathering of farmers and other food producers an extra 10,000 visas will be made available for the agriculture sector.\n\nThis would be on top of the current 45,000 allocated.\n\nBut on Monday, Suella Braverman said there was no reason the UK could not train its own fruit pickers.\n\nAt a speech, the home secretary said it was \"not racist\" to want to control borders and her aim was to reduce net migration.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr Sunak said the government was responding to the needs of farmers by offering the extra visas.\n\nAsked by Farming Today on BBC Radio 4 why the number of visas was not higher, Mr Sunak said: \"I think the number is appropriate.\n\n\"We haven't used the 45,000 allocation last year. Before we start saying we need more it's reasonable to extend the current numbers.\"\n\nThe Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said the extra visa numbers were also offered to the agricultural sector last year.\n\nAround 70 leading members of the food industry, including farmers and supermarket bosses, met with the prime minister and his colleagues to talk about how the UK can improve the way it produces and sells food.\n\nIt comes against a backdrop of continued high prices, and new research from the consumer group Which? that said the price of some goods had jumped by as much as 25% in April, compared with the same month last year.\n\nDairy products such as cheese saw the biggest rise, the group said.\n\nOverall, in a survey of the UK's eight largest supermarkets looking at 26,000 products, it said food prices rose more than 17%.\n\nSupermarkets are starting to bring down the prices of bread and butter but Which? said prices remained at \"shockingly high levels\" compared with last year.\n\nIt also found supermarket own-label budget items were up 25% in April compared with the same period 12 months ago.\n\nThe consumer group said it was \"concerned the voices of millions of people\" struggling with soaring food inflation had not been heard at the summit.\n\n\"Families up and down the country are facing a daily struggle to put food on the table and it's clear the big supermarkets could...make available a range of healthy budget foods available in all shops,\" it said.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Tesco announced that it was cutting prices of vegetable and sunflower oil, as well as pasta by 15p. But a 500g bag of penne pasta is still 80p - in 2021, it was 50p.\n\nHowever, Bill Grimsey, the former boss of frozen food chain Iceland, warned: \"If anybody thinks prices are going to come down quickly anytime soon, well they're not.\"\n\nFarmers and businesses have been hit by rising operating costs, in part caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nOther expenses such as shipping costs - which soared during the Covid pandemic - have since fallen but Mr Grimsey said shoppers are unlikely to see the impact of this on the prices they pay.\n\nThe government also pledged to put greater emphasis on farmers' interests in future trade deals and said it would review horticulture and egg supply chains to \"ensure farmers get a fair price for their produce\".\n\nMany farmers have argued that supermarkets are not giving them a fair deal for certain goods, such as eggs.\n\nAsh Amirahmadi, managing director of the UK's largest dairy producer Arla Foods, attended the summit and told the BBC the meeting was a \"good start\", but added that the government needed to \"follow through\" on its commitment to prioritise the UK's food industry.\n\nArla managing director Ash Amirahmadi said high food price inflation was being felt across the world\n\nMr Amirahmadi said burgeoning costs in the sector were not unique to the UK and were about 40% up before inflation first started rising, though he cautioned against a return to the days of cheap milk.\n\n\"I expect when we fully come out of this prices will be higher than they were before,\" he added.\n\nThe British Retail Consortium (BRC), which represents retailers, has said they are \"doing all they can to keep food prices as low as possible\" and called on the government to streamline regulation around recycling, packaging and Brexit to try to bring down prices for consumers.", "The number of people living with major illnesses in England will rise nine times faster than the healthy working age population, projections show.\n\nBy 2040 nearly one in five will have health conditions such as dementia and cancer, up from one in six in 2019.\n\nThe Health Foundation, which did the analysis, said the population shift would have a major impact on the NHS.\n\nThe think tank said it would require a radical shift, with more care in the community, rather than hospitals.\n\nThe projections suggest there will be 9.1 million people with a major health condition by 2040, a 37% rise in the latest data from 2019.\n\nBy comparison, the number of healthy working-age people will increase by just 4%.\n\nMost of the increase is being driven by the ageing population, but there will be growing numbers of young people living in ill health too, the report said.\n\nThere will be particularly big increases in people living with anxiety and depression, chronic pain and diabetes.\n\nObesity is one of the major factors that will drive rises in illnesses.\n\nThis will more than offset the gains made by fewer people smoking, and lower cholesterol levels.\n\nLead researcher Anita Charlesworth said: \"The challenge of an ageing population with rising levels of major illness is not unique to the NHS.\n\n\"Countries across the globe face the same pressures. How well prepared we are to meet the challenge is what will set us apart.\n\n\"Over the next two decades, the growth in major illness will place additional demand on all parts of the NHS.\n\n\"But the impact will extend well beyond the health service too - and has significant implications for other public services, the labour market and the public finances.\"\n\nShe said while living with a major health condition would not necessarily exclude everyone from the workforce, many would be excluded.\n\nDr Layla McCay, of the NHS Confederation, which represents health managers, said the projections were \"worrying\" given the increased pressure and demand on the NHS which the changes would lead to.\n\nShe said there needed to be a greater focus on prevention to reduce the numbers living in ill health.\n\nAnd she added that investment in social care to support older people would also be needed: \"We know that investment in health will support our ageing population to live well with illness, as well as support economic growth.\"", "Stephanie Duthie and her 18-year-old daughter Bryony (right)\n\nThe family of a teenager put in a coma after developing pneumonia while on holiday in Spain have booked a \u00a333,000 medical flight to bring her home.\n\nBryony Duthie, who suffers from a rare chronic kidney condition, fell ill on 16 July on the Costa Del Sol.\n\nThe 18-year-old stirred from her coma on Friday but slipped back into unconsciousness.\n\nDoctors at Vithas Xanit International Hospital Benalmadena have so far been unable to remove her from life support.\n\nHer family hope she can be flown from Malaga to Dundee on Thursday on an IAS Medical plane.\n\nIt will be equipped like an intensive care unit to keep her alive during the journey.\n\nHer mother, Stephanie Duthie, 37, from Dundee, said: \"I'm just in a million pieces. We just need to get her home.\n\n\"The hospital have told us that they want her to be ventilated when she flies.\n\n\"We found a flight company who are willing to fly her home for \u00a333,000 but it's not until next Thursday.\"\n\nMs Duthie, who recently completed a degree in social work, said the pilot plans to fly to Dundee, their nearest airport, provided there is no rain.\n\nIf not, a longer runway at Aberdeen, Edinburgh or Glasgow will be used, although this would complicate the journey.\n\nThe family is also facing a second estimated medical bill of 27,000 euro (\u00a323,400) for another nine days of private healthcare in Spain after already being charged more than \u00a313,000 for her first two nights in hospital and initial treatment. The cost was not covered by their travel insurance policy.\n\nThey have set up a fundraising page which has surpassed \u00a350,000.\n\nThe Duthie family thought Bryony, who lost her father when she was three, had become ill because of her chronic kidney problems.\n\nBut a CT scan later revealed she had pneumonia.\n\nWhile doctors have been trying to cautiously bring her out of the coma, they fear she could suffer another seizure at any time.\n\nMs Duthie added: \"She's starting to wake up but when I say that, I mean she's opening her eyes, she's not compos mentis.\n\n\"She can't follow commands, like squeeze my finger or anything like that.\n\n\"They have now put her back into a coma. It's really horrible to watch.\"\n\nMs Duthie is also concerned that her daughter will have to be moved to a state hospital in Spain if she cannot be flown home because the family cannot afford to keep her in private care.\n\nShe said: \"I'm scared to move her now but it's three grand a day just to be there.\n\n\"Her condition, renal tubular acidosis, is so rare and unique that it's taken them so long to get her stable.\n\n\"We just need to get her home.\"\n\nMs Duthie thanked the public for their generosity and kind wishes.\n\nShe added: \"From the bottom of my heart, I just want to say thank you to everybody who has sent anything, from a penny to \u00a3100, to those who have shared, who have retweeted.\n\n\"We are forever indebted to these people who have donated, we could never say thank you enough.\"", "UK nationals have to make their own way to an airstrip near Sudanese capital Khartoum to be evacuated\n\nThis is a race against time, circumstances and numbers.\n\nAnd all three are bleak. Time is ticking down to the ceasefire ending.\n\nThe circumstances are grim: unpredictable, volatile and dangerous.\n\nAnd the latest numbers published by the Foreign Office make it look, on the face of it, like it will be very difficult to get every Brit out in time before the fighting resumes.\n\nThe Foreign Office have said 536 people have now been evacuated from Sudan on six UK flights as of 21:00 GMT on Wednesday evening.\n\nEstimates as to how many British passport holders there are in Sudan vary considerably, but it is widely expected to be a few thousand at least.\n\nAnd the Foreign Secretary, James Cleverly, has candidly spelt out that the ceasefire ends on Thursday night and \"we cannot guarantee how many further flights will depart once the ceasefire ends\".\n\nBut, having spoken to people across government, they feel things are going as well as could be hoped. A phrase I keep hearing is the \"calibration of risk.\" Rolling risk assessments of what is possible. How to help, without jeopardising the safety of the rescuers or the rescued.\n\nIt should not be a \"race to get it wrong\", as one figure put it. But being the last to get it right is not a prize anyone wants either.\n\nYou can hear the exhaustion and sleep deprivation in the voices of those working on this. There is talk of people sleeping on sofas in between long stints in the Foreign Office's Crisis Centre.\n\nSources tell me there is the capacity to increase the frequency of flights out of Khartoum, if needs be. There is also the option of taking people out by ship from Port Sudan. But the focus is on those flights, for now.\n\nContingency planning is under way for what to do when the ceasefire ends.\n\nAll this, as the government faces criticism from some that they have been too slow.\n\nSome of those flown out of Sudan have expressed gratitude at being rescued in their first sentence, and criticism at its lack of pace in their second.\n\nAnd there have been comparisons with how other countries have managed things.\n\nFrance, for instance, collected some of its people who wanted to leave, rather than asking them to make their own way to the airfield. One of their soldiers was seriously injured in the process.\n\nUK Special Forces were used to extract British diplomats. But the government argues it would be hugely dangerous to provide what would amount to an armed taxi service to take people to the airport, as it would risk drawing the UK into the conflict.\n\nAnd the numbers of citizens it is attempting to help is far greater than other comparable countries.\n\nForeign Secretary James Cleverly said the UK can not guarantee how many more flights will depart Sudan when the ceasefire ends\n\nIncidentally, as my colleague, the BBC Berlin correspondent Jenny Hill, has reported, there has been something of a spat between the German government and the UK government, with Berlin accusing London of delaying the evacuation of its own citizens by landing in Sudan without permission at the weekend.\n\nThere is private shock here that Germany went public with this and a desire not to be drawn into a diplomatic tit for tat over it. The Foreign Office and Ministry of Defence are denying the allegation.\n\nIt is worth mentioning too that there is not a domestic political row here at Westminster about how the government is handling things.\n\nPrivately some Labour figures think it has been too slow. But they are not leaping to criticise ministers - perhaps conscious any critique would, by extension, be seen as undermining the armed forces, diplomats and others doing all they can in very difficult circumstances.\n\nThe political argument may, of course, change, as that race against time, circumstances and numbers continues with the prospect it gets considerably more difficult.", "The film's marketing campaign has been huge - and hugely successful - with debut takings worldwide of $337m (\u00a3293m)\n\n'Barbenheimer' fever took hold in the UK as Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer and Greta Gerwig's Barbie took \u00a330m on their opening box office weekend.\n\nAccording to the UK Cinema Association, that makes it the most successful weekend for UK cinema-going since 2019.\n\nThat year, Disney blockbuster Avengers: Endgame opened with takings of \u00a343.7m.\n\nThe Vue cinema chain said this weekend marked the second biggest in its history by admissions.\n\nBarbie is now on track to become the biggest film released so far this year, ahead of Super Mario Bros.\n\nA more detailed breakdown of the weekend's UK box office figures will be published later on Monday.\n\nBarbie's marketing campaign has been huge - and hugely successful - with debut takings worldwide of $337m (\u00a3293m).\n\nUS and Canada takings were enough to make it the biggest opener of 2023 so far in that region.\n\nThe film took an estimated $155m (\u00a3120m) according to distributor Warner Bros, while Oppenheimer made $93.7m (\u00a372m), Universal Pictures said.\n\nThe North American box office figure broke the opening weekend record for a female director, easily overtaking the $103.3m opening of Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman.\n\nBoth films have been a welcome relief for cinemas who are battling against the juggernaut of streaming.\n\nOppenheimer's plot is centred on the development of the first atomic bomb, starring Cillian Murphy and directed by Christopher Nolan.\n\nBarbie tells a coming-of-age story of the children's character where she explores her identity and encourages friend Ken to establish individuality.\n\nAccording to Billboard, film polling service PostTrak reported that women made up 65% of the Barbie audience, while 40% of ticket-buyers were under the age of 25.\n\nIt wasn't all plain sailing for Barbie, however.

We now need to come together - fans, players and staff - and show the poise, quality and fight to secure our position as a Premier League club.\"\n\nThere have now been 12 managerial departures in the Premier League this season, and of the bottom nine teams in the league, only West Ham and Nottingham Forest have not made a change.\n\nSpeaking on Radio 5 Live, former Leicester midfielder Robbie Savage said: \"Brendan has been unbelievable at Leicester. He had options to go elsewhere but stayed loyal. Results haven't been good enough, though. So is it the right thing? Inevitably the manager takes responsibility. The big question is: Do they have a plan?\"The short-termism in management is remarkable. If you have an chance to move to bigger clubs but stay loyal to the club, where is the reward in that? The inevitability is you will be sacked.\n\n\"It's not a decision the board will have taken lightly. You do it with the best interests of the club at heart. If they stay up, it would be the right decision.\"\n\n'His place in Leicester history is assured'\n\nRodgers, 50, led Leicester to consecutive fifth-place finishes in his first two full seasons, and they also beat Chelsea to lift the FA Cup in 2021.\n\nBut his side began the 2022-23 campaign with seven defeats from their opening 10 Premier League games, slumping to the bottom of the table before a run of four wins from five games going into the World Cup break.\n\nThey have struggled since the season resumed, collecting just seven points from 33 available.\n\nLeicester exited the Carabao Cup against Newcastle and the FA Cup against Blackburn during that run.\n\nThe Foxes rallied in January when a 2-2 draw with Brighton was followed by impressive wins over Aston Villa and Tottenham - scoring four goals in both of those victories.\n\nBut results again dipped, with the club failing to win in eight games in all competitions since the victory over Spurs on 11 February.\n\nRodgers won 92 of his 204 games in charge - a win percentage of 45.1%.\n\nSrivaddhanaprabha added: \"The achievements of the team under Brendan's management speak for themselves - we've experienced some of our finest footballing moments under his guidance and will always be grateful to him and his staff for the heights they helped us to reach on the pitch.\n\n\"Off the pitch, Brendan embraced the culture of the club and helped cultivate an outstanding developmental environment, particularly during the transition to Seagrave, and provided strong leadership during the unprecedented challenge of the coronavirus pandemic. His place in Leicester City history is assured.\"\n\nClub have had to balance the books\n\nEarlier in the season, Rodgers said Leicester was not the club \"that it was a couple of years ago\" after a frustrating summer transfer window.\n\nOnly defender Wout Faes and goalkeeper Alex Smithies were brought in during the summer, with Rodgers saying the club had to balance the books.\n\nIn January, they signed defender Harry Souttar from Stoke City, left-back Victor Kristiansen from Copenhagen and brought in winger Tete from Ukrainian club Shakhtar Donetsk on loan.\n\nIn March, Leicester announced pre-tax losses of \u00a392.5m for the year up to 31 May 2022 - an increase of \u00a361.3m compared to the previous 12 months.\n\nThere have been some high-profile departures, with defender Wesley Fofana joining Chelsea for about \u00a370m last summer and goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel, a key figure in their title-winning side, leaving for Nice.\n\nReaction - 'Panic stations among so many teams'\n\nFormer England winger Chris Waddle on BBC Radio 5 Live: \"No-one expected Leicester to be near the bottom three. It is a surprise. They have had problems, key players have left - Schmeichel was a massive loss.\n\n\"They have had financial problems, and have brought players in perhaps not to the standard they wanted. He's done a very good job with the players he has to work with. But a lot of teams have pressed the panic button and you can't afford to drop out of this league.\"\n\nFormer Liverpool midfielder Jamie Redknapp on Sky Sports: \"He hasn't had that spark this season. Something wasn't right. I'm a big fan of Brendan and no doubt he will get back in football. Look at what Crystal Palace have done - it is panic stations among so many teams.\"\n\nFormer Newcastle goalkeeper Shay Given on Sky Sports: \"I feel for Brendan. In the past two years, he has not been backed by the owners and that is not Brendan's problem. He got the rug pulled from under his feet. He is a top manager and will get another top job.

The computer's version of her appeal successfully got her out of a \u00a360 fine.\n\nAlso this week, without much fanfare, the government published draft proposals on how to regulate this emerging technology, while a letter signed by more than 1,000 tech experts including Tesla boss Elon Musk called on the world to press pause on the development of more advanced AI because it poses \"profound risks to humanity\".\n\nYou are not alone if you don't understand all the terms being bandied about:\n\nIt's the speed at which the technology is progressing that led those tech entrepreneurs to intervene, with one AI leader even writing in a US magazine this week: \"Shut it down.\"\n\nTwitter, Tesla and SpaceX mogul Elon Musk is one of those calling for a pause to the development of advanced AI\n\nEstonian billionaire Jaan Tallinn is one of them. He was one of the brains behind internet communication app Skype but is now one of the leading voices trying to put the brakes on.\n\nI asked him, in an interview for this Sunday's show, to explain the threat as simply as he could.\n\n\"Imagine if you substitute human civilisation with AI civilisation,\" he told me. \"Civilisation that could potentially run millions of times faster than humans... so like, imagine global warming was sped up a million times.\n\n\"One big vector of existential risk is that we are going to lose control over our environment.\n\n\"Once we have AIs that we a) cannot stop and b) are smart enough to do things like geoengineering, build their own structures, build their own AIs, then, what's going to happen to their environment, the environment that we critically need for our survival? It's up in the air.\"\n\nAnd if governments don't act? Mr Tallinn thinks it's possible to \"apply the existing technology, regulation, knowledge and regulatory frameworks\" to the current generation of AI, but says the \"big worry\" is letting the technology race ahead without society adapting: \"Then we are in a lot of trouble.\"\n\nIt's worth noting they are not saying they want to put a stop to the lot but pause the high-end work that is training computers to be ever smarter and more like us.\n\nThe pace of change and its potential presents an almighty challenge to governments around the world.\n\nWestminster and technology are not always a happy mix and while politics moves pretty fast these days, compared to developments in Silicon Valley, it's a snail versus an F1 car.\n\nThere are efforts to put up some guard rails in other countries. On Friday Italy banned ChatGPT while the EU is working on an Artificial Intelligence Act. China is bringing in laws and a \"registry\" for algorithms - the step-by-step instructions used in programming that tell computers what to do.\n\nBut the UK government's set of draft proposals this week proposed no new laws, and no new watchdog or regulator to take it on. Even though the White Paper is an effort to manage one of the biggest technological changes in history, blink and you might have missed it.\n\nThe government wants, for now, to give existing regulators like the Health and Safety Executive the responsibility of keeping an eye on what is going on. The argument is that AI will potentially have a role in every aspect of our lives, in endless ways, so to create one new big referee is the wrong approach. One minister told me that \"it's a whole revolution\" so \"identifying it as one technology is wrong\".\n\nMinisters also want the UK to make the most of its undoubted expertise in the field because AI is big business with huge potential benefits.\n\nThe government is reluctant to introduce tight regulation that could strangle innovation. The challenge according to the minister is to be \"very, very tough on the bad stuff\", but \"harness the seriously beneficial bits\" too.\n\nThat approach hasn't persuaded Labour's shadow digital secretary Lucy Powell, who says the government \"hasn't grappled with the scale of the problem\" and we are \"running to catch up\".\n\nAre existing regulators really up to the task? The Health and Safety Executive wouldn't say how many staff it had ready to work on the issue or are being trained. \"We will work with the government and other regulators as AI develops and explore the challenges and opportunities it brings using our scientific expertise,\" they told me.\n\nShould we be as worried about AI as clerics were about the printing press in the 15th Century?\n\nHow on earth can any government strike the right balance? Predictions about the potential of technology are often wildly wrong. One MP familiar with the field reckons: \"The tech bros have all watched a bit too much Terminator - how does this technology go from a computer program to removing oxygen from the atmosphere?\" The MP believes heavier regulation won't be required for a few years.\n\nOne tech firm has told us there is no need to panic: \"There are harms we're already aware of, like deep fake videos impersonating people or students cheating on tests, but that's quite a leap to then say we should all be terrified of a sentient machine taking control or killing humanity.\"\n\nAnother senior MP, whose been studying the UK's proposals, says the risks are not yet \"catastrophic\" and it's better to take a careful and gradual approach to any new laws than \"take a running jump, and splash into the unknown\".\n\nBut to worry about big changes is part of human nature. Clerics worried the printing press would make monks lazy in the 15th Century. Weavers smashed up machines in the 19th Century fearing they'd lose their livelihood.\n\nEven your author snubbed the offer of a mobile phone in 1997 convinced they'd only be for \"show-offs\" and would never really catch on.\n\nWhat is certain, is that this generation of politicians and those who follow will increasingly have to spend their time grappling with this emerging frontier of technology.", "A joint funeral service has taken place for brother and sister Dan and Christine McKane who died in the collision\n\nThe hearts of a community have been \"torn apart\" by the deaths of two siblings in a crash in Strabane, County Tyrone, a priest has said.\n\nBrother and sister Christine and and Dan McKane died along with their aunt Julia McSorley, 75, in the collision on the A5 last Thursday,\n\nThe minibus they were travelling in was in a collision with a lorry.\n\nMourners have heard how Dan McKane was \"a big-hearted\" man who lived for his family.\n\nChristine McKane was described as \"small in stature but big of heart\".\n\nFr Declan Boland told mourners in The Church of The Immaculate Conception, she was \"a pocket rocket\" whose children and grandchildren were \"everything to her\".\n\nBrother and sister Dan and Christine McKane died in the collision\n\nThe mother-of-three was described as a \"chocoholic\" who was \"so proud of her two wonderful little grandchildren\".\n\n\"Her wonderful children and beautiful grandchildren, they were everything to Christine.

She is reported to have asked civil servants about a one-on-one course, citing security concerns about doing one as part of a group. She was told it was not a matter for the civil service.\n\nShe then asked a special adviser to try to arrange a private course.\n\nWhen the speed course provider said there was no option to do this, Mrs Braverman opted to pay the fine and accept the points, because she was \"very busy\" a source told the BBC. By this point she had been reappointed as home secretary in Mr Sunak's government.\n\nThe same government source refused to say whether Mrs Braverman's motivation to do the course in private was to reduce the chances of her being recognised by members of the public.\n\nSpeeding awareness course providers are contracted by individual police forces. According to UK Road Offender Education, the not-for-profit organisation responsible, these contracts make \"no provision for private one-to-one courses\" at the request of the driver.\n\nThe ministerial code requires ministers to ensure \"no conflict arises\" between their public duties and their private interests.\n\nRepeatedly asked in an interview whether she instructed officials to arrange a one-on-one speeding course, Mrs Braverman said: \"Last summer, I was speeding, I regret that, I paid the fine and I took the points.\"\n\nAsked whether she would welcome an investigation into what happened or if she had spoken to the prime minister about it, Ms Braverman said: \"I am focussed on working as the home secretary.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Yvette Cooper claims Suella Braverman is \"not answering basic factual questions\" about her 2022 speeding fine\n\nSpeaking to the Westminster Hour on BBC Radio 4, former senior civil servant Sir Philip Rycroft said Mrs Braverman's reported actions appeared to be a \"real lapse of judgement\".\n\n\"Obviously, there's still investigations to be done and so on but the code is very clear. Ministers must ensure that no conflict arises or appears to arise between their public duties and their private interests.\n\n\"Even asking a question of a civil servant as to how she might go on one of these courses puts them in an impossible position.\"\n\nThe ministerial code sets standards of conduct expected of ministers, including that they must uphold the political impartiality of the civil service.\n\nFormer business secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg told Radio 4's World at One, he was confident Ms Braverman had not broken any rules.\n\n\"What goes on in private offices is a minister is busy and has many things to do and sometimes will ask for something the civil servants can't do,\" he said.\n\n\"As soon as once they say no, and you accept it, you haven't done anything wrong.\"\n\nIn the Commons, Mr Sunak told MPs he has \"asked for further information\" and will update MPs \"on the appropriate course of action in due course\".\n\nThe prime minister's official spokesman said Mr Sunak \"wants to avail himself of all the information before he makes a decision\". The prime minister still has confidence in the home secretary, the spokesman added.\n\nMrs Braverman was in Downing Street on Monday lunchtime, and afterwards headed to the House of Commons for a scheduled question session from MPs on Home Office issues.\n\nDuring the session, Mrs Braverman was repeatedly pressed on whether she had asked civil servants to arrange a private speed awareness course.\n\nLabour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: \"If the home secretary can't grip on her own rule-breaking behaviour how can she get a grip on anything else.\"\n\nThe home secretary told MPs she had paid the speeding fine and had not sought to avoid any sanction.\n\nLabour Leader Sir Keir Starmer said the prime minister should order his adviser, Sir Laurie Magnus, to investigate whether ministerial rules were broken.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Breakfast, Sir Keir said it looked like \"inappropriate action took place\" from the home secretary that \"needs to be fully investigated\".\n\n\"The usual consequence of breaking the ministerial code is that you'll go,\" he added.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats are also calling for an investigation and said Mr Sunak needed to make a statement in Parliament about the claims.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. \"Did you have any questions about the summit?\" Rishi Sunak asks the BBC's Chris Mason\n\nAnswering questions at the G7 summit over the weekend, Mr Sunak apparently did not know anything about the story the until it was first reported in the Sunday Times. and he declined to say whether he would be ordering an investigation.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference, he also declined to say he backed Mrs Braverman - but a Downing Street source later said that \"of course\" he did.\n\nAfter serving as attorney general between February 2020 and September 2022, Mrs Braverman was promoted to home secretary under Liz Truss.\n\nShe resigned on 19 October after sending an official document from a personal email to a backbench MP - describing it as a \"technical infringement of the rules\". But she was reappointed to the same role by Mr Sunak six days later following the collapse of Liz Truss's government.", "The whales stranded on Lewis will be moved to a landfill in Stornoway for post-mortem examinations\n\nScientists are carrying out a \"monumental\" post-mortem investigation on a pod of 55 whales that became stranded in the Western Isles.\n\nOnly 15 were alive after they washed on to Traigh Mhor beach at North Tolsta on the Isle of Lewis on Sunday morning.\n\nOne is believed to have been successfully refloated, but the rest were euthanised on welfare grounds.\n\nIt is the highest number of deaths following a mass stranding of animals in the UK for at least 70 years.\n\nLeading veterinary pathologist Dr Andrew Brownlow said the investigation would be a \"monumental task\".\n\nHe is director of the Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme (SMASS), whose team will carry out the post-mortem examinations.\n\nAttempts were made to give surviving whales first aid on Sunday\n\nThey will gather data from a select number of the whales as they would be unable to examine all 55.\n\nWeather could also impede the process though Dr Brownlow said conditions had improved since Sunday.\n\nHe told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"It's going to be a monumental task.\n\n\"There are more animals sadly which are awaiting necropsy now than all of the mass strandings put together for the last decade.\n\n\"What we will try and do is triage these animals - we will select those animals that we think best represent the rest of the pod and make sure that we take samples and as much data that we can.\n\n\"Then it's simply a race against time, energy and weather. We will do the most that we possibly can to find out what's been going on here.\"\n\nPilot whales are known for their strong social bonds, so often when one whale gets into difficulty and strands, the rest follow.\n\nBetween 60-70 of the animals came into shallow waters in Sutherland in 2011 while 21 died during a stranding at Pittenweem in 2012.\n\nAccording to the Natural History Museum, the largest UK stranding took place in 1927 when 126 out of more than 130 false killer whales died in the Dornoch Firth in the Highlands.\n\nThere are also accounts of a mass stranding of pilot whales at Dunbar, East Lothian, in May 1950 with some reports saying 147 were found on the beach.\n\nMarine charity British Divers Marine Life Rescue (BDMLR) said the pod on Lewis could have followed a female on to the beach when she became unwell while giving birth - as happened at Staffin on Skye in 2015.\n\nHowever Dr Brownlow said there are a number of reasons behind strandings and his team will be looking to rule out human impact.\n\nHe said: \"Pilot whale strandings have happened for centuries - it's not necessarily the case that it's because of human impact.\n\n\"But that's one of the things we want to try and investigate and rule out - to see whether or not some of the things that can affect these animals such as underwater noise, interaction with fishing gear, accumulation of toxins or disease may have played a part.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. About 55 whales were stranded on Sunday morning\n\nOn Sunday attempts were made to give the surviving whales first aid.\n\nBDMLR attempted to refloat two of the more active whales - one successfully got away but another was later found further down the beach.\n\nThe whales are now being moved to a landfill in Stornoway where they will be buried after investigations take place.\n\nDr Brownlow said whales can be left to decompose on beaches as they form part of the natural nutrient cycle - but it the decision to move them was \"understandable\" as Traigh Mhor is one of the more popular beaches on the island.\n\nWestern Isles Council - Comhairle nan Eilean Siar - has asked people to avoid the area as the operation to remove the whales takes place.\n\nLast year more than 200 of the same species of whales were found stranded on a remote beach on the west coast of Tasmania, Australia.\n\nDr Brownlow said although 55 whales was a large stranding for Scotland, it was \"not unprecedented\" - but had nevertheless attracted interest from scientists around the world.\n\n\"Although this is pretty grim and a relatively challenging thing to do, you can actually learn a lot from these animals,\" he said.\n\n\"There is interest from all over the world - we've been contacted from the guys in Tasmania who have offered us support and best wishes but are also very interested to know what we find out.\n\n\"From the process of examining these animals we can learn a lot about the threats and pressures that affect not just the animals in our waters but globally.

The bare numbers of his story versus Rangers reveal how much of a bogey man he's been to the Ibrox club.\n\nIn the December meeting at Celtic Park, Kyogo had two shots on target and scored with one of them, which turned out to be the decisive goal.\n\nIn September at Ibrox, he had just nine touches of the ball in 76 minutes, one of them being the match-winner.\n\nLast April, in a 3-2 win, he had two shots on target and two goals from only 17 touches.\n\nA few months earlier, just when it looked like Rangers were going to win 2-1 at Ibrox, Kyogo poked in the equaliser with two minutes left. It was his only attempt on target. He had 15 touches and was largely anonymous, until he wasn't.\n\nThis time last year he was on 26 goals. Now he's on 16.\n\u2022 None Rodgers has no issue with 'top referee' Beaton\n\u2022 None What do the numbers tell us about derby?\n\nHe's had those Old Firm highs, but it's not been a vintage season for Kyogo. He's missed the service of Jota on one side and Liel Abada on the other, the holy trinity of the Ange Postecoglou years.\n\nHe's playing deeper under Rodgers and has suffered from the musical chairs on either side of him, the constant changing of the wide players and the lack of fluency it has brought at times. Some of that has been down to injury.\n\nHe'll still occupy the every waking thought of the Rangers defence in the build-up to Sunday.\n\nThey all know about his stealth, they've all been burned by his capacity to appear under the thumb for large parts of a game before, metaphorically, breaking free and thumping them in the face. In Kyogo, Celtic will continue to trust.\n\nIf Kyogo has inflicted pain on Rangers, then Brendan Rodgers has really been torturer-in-chief.\n\nFifteen games with 12 victories and only one defeat. A 4-0, a 5-0 and a 5-1. A total of 34 goals scored and only eight conceded. 1,350 minutes played and behind for only 108 of those. Eight clean sheets to Rangers' two.\n\nEven when his team have looked shaky, they've still done the job.\n\nGoing into the first meeting of the season, Celtic had drawn with St Johnstone and had lost to Kilmarnock in their previous two games. Rangers smelt blood at Ibrox that day. Celtic won 1-0.\n\nEarlier in December, they lost to Kilmarnock and Hearts before facing Rangers. Philippe Clement's side had gone unbeaten in 16 matches, winning 13, one of which was away to Real Betis in the Europa League. A Betis team who five days before had drawn 1-1 with the Real Madrid of Jude Bellingham, Luka Modric, Toni Kroos and Federico Valverde.\n\n'It wasn't supposed to be like this for prodigal son'\n\nRodgers' dominance has entered the history books. With an 80% win rate, he has the highest win return of any Old Firm manager in major competitions.\n\nDoubt from the outside world accompanied all the way to kick-off in both of his games against Rangers this season but Rodgers - and Kyogo - came up with the solutions. But there's doubt again now.\n\nThis season has not been the Celtic procession that some might have thought it was going to be. Rangers have got their act together while Celtic have bobbed along on choppy waters.\n\nA poor summer transfer window followed by a poor January transfer window. The sound of booing at Celtic Park. The sound of Rodgers having a go at those booing. The endless grief with the Green Brigade. The \"good girl\" saga that saw Rodgers slammed by a women's campaigning group. The Scottish FA charge - and subsequent touchline ban - for accusing officials of incompetence.\n\nIt's been a grind. Five draws and three defeats. Ninetieth-minute wins against Hibs and Motherwell twice. It wasn't supposed to be like this for the prodigal son.\n\nAnd yet, they're still top of the league, albeit with Rangers having a game in hand.\n\nThey've scored more goals than their city rivals, have a higher expected goals count and have created more big chances.\n\nThey've not been fluent nearly as often as Rodgers would have liked - he's had some harsh words to say about their negativity and their lack of speed of thought and movement along the way - but they're still there.\n\nAnd if they win, or even draw, on Sunday you'd make them favourites to win the title because they'll have Rangers at Celtic Park post-split, a Celtic Park that will be heaving to the sound of 60,000 fans getting on the backs of visiting players, many of whom have never closed a deal as big as this one.\n\nRangers will be encouraged by Callum McGregor's absence since the end of February and hopeful that, even if he is ready to play, then he won't be at his totemic best.\n\nFor Rodgers, it's bigger this time. He has never faced this kind of game in Scotland before, a game that if lost could - and most probably would - cost him the title.\n\nThat's alien territory for the Celtic manager. In his previous incarnation they'd have been organising the party by now.\n\nIt's what makes Sunday so intoxicating. Rodgers, and how he will be viewed by Celtic fans in victory or in defeat, is a drama unto itself. Given their complicated feelings about him, it's a love-in or a pile-on balanced on a knife edge.\n\nAll 15 of his Old Firm games have been important, but this one holds more peril than any of the others.\n\nHave your say on Rodgers & Celtic\n\nIf the form doesn't load properly, go straight to it here...\n\u2022 Celtic is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment\n\u2022 None Everything Celtic - go straight to all the best content", "The co-founder and guitarist of Irish rock band The Script, Mark Sheehan, has died.\n\nThe 46-year-old died in hospital on Friday following a brief illness, the band announced.\n\nSheehan formed the group in 2001 alongside vocalist Danny O'Donoghue and drummer Glen Power.\n\nA statement on the band's social media pages said Sheehan was a \"much loved husband, father, brother, band mate and friend\".\n\nIt asked fans to respect the privacy of his family and bandmates.\n\nIreland's president Michael D Higgins said Sheehan was an \"outstanding\" example of Irish musical success on the world stage.\n\n\"It was a mark of the originality and excellence that Mark and his bandmates in The Script sought that they saw such success across the world, including six number one albums in the UK and a number three album in the United States - a truly remarkable achievement,\" he said.\n\nContemporaries of Sheehan's in the entertainment industry were quick to honour his memory.\n\nIn a statement posted on Instagram, Irish presenter Laura Whitmore wrote: \"Thinking of you all at this time.\n\n\"Mark was one of the nicest and most talented men you could meet.\"\n\nFellow Irish rock band Kodaline have also paid tribute, posting on Twitter: \"So sorry to hear (of) the passing of Mark Sheehan.\"\n\nIn an Instagram tribute, Irish pop duo Jedward said: \"Everyone in the Irish music industry and worldwide mourn your loss RIP Mark such a talented musician from The Script one of the most iconic Irish groups of our generation.\"\n\nFellow musicians and celebrities have come forward to pay tribute to Mark Sheehan\n\nSheehan was born on 29 October 1976 in Dublin in Mount Brown in The Liberties area, and was married to Reena Sheehan with whom he had three children.\n\nHe was a singer, songwriter and guitarist, and passionate about music from a young age.\n\nFrom 1996-2001 he was a member of the band Mytown, alongside The Script's frontman O'Donoghue.\n\nThe Script started in Dublin in 2001 with Sheehan as guitarist, O'Donoghue as singer songwriter and Power as drummer.\n\nThe band moved to London after signing a record contract with Sony Music Group.\n\nIt was there that they released their first full album, \"We Cry\", which went on to reach number one in both Ireland and the UK.\n\nAfter that their next three albums Science & Faith, #3 and No Sound Without Silence, all topped the album charts in both countries.\n\nScience & Faith reached number three in the United States and number two in Australia.\n\nSince then the band have continued to tour the world and release original music albums, combining Irish themes with pop-rock nuances.\n\nThey have been known for their writing from the heart, including \"If You Could See Me Now\", addressing the death of vocalist O'Donoghue's father and both of Sheehan's parents.\n\nFans over the last year have wondered why Sheehan had a short break from the stage.\n\nIn 2022, Sheehan missed the US leg of the band's tour.

I thought it was good to get involved because of the concern about lots of sports having problems with concussion\".\n\nHe cited \"serious worries, particularly with the laws of the game now, where they stand right on top of each other\".\n\n\"There seems to be a bit of a conflict between the laws, and the early onset of cognitive degeneration,\" he said.\n\nHe said cognitive health was not really known about when he played, but much less time was spent training.\n\n\"The game was amateur, we only probably had physical contact once a week. Now they have it every day, the brain needs time to recover, it's like any organ in the body, it is quite a worry, it's repetitive, not even huge bangs but repetitive small injuries to the brain can be a problem in later life.\"\n\nThe 55-cap full-back wants the game to return to how it was in the 1970s, with more space for players, \"to decrease the ferocity of the hits\". He also wants reduced tackling and contact in training.\n\nHe urged governing bodies \"to take more notice than they do\" of studies such as this.\n\nWilliams reflected on an infamous moment of his career when he was stamped on by New Zealand prop John Ashworth while playing for Bridgend against the All Blacks in 1978.\n\nKnowing what he knows now, he probably would not have returned to the field after having his face stitched up by his father at the side of the pitch.\n\nScientists at USW's neurovascular research laboratory analysed the brain health of 20 retired players aged between 60 and 80 who had suffered concussions.\n\nFor the first time, researchers found they had reduced blood and oxygen flow to the brain due to less nitric oxide, which helps blood vessels regulate blood around the body.\n\nSome exhibited signs of mild cognitive impairment and all were outperformed by the control group in cognitive function tests.\n\nThe researchers said this was the first study to determine mechanisms that may cause cognitive decline and has implications for other contact sports.\n\nIt is hoped the research may contribute to improving protection for players and help with the introduction of pitch-side blood or saliva tests for concussion.\n\nJPR Williams (third from right) with fellow ex-rugby stars at the launch of BBC Wales series Slammed\n\nMr Owens said: \"It's important to note that we don't want to stop players playing rugby, but we want to make them inherently aware of the risks associated with forms of brain trauma and concussion.\n\n\"Make them aware, improve the way that we detect concussion at the pitchside and then improve the way we care for players following retirement.\"\n\nFormer Bridgend RFC captain Meredydd James also took part in the study, and said there was no knowledge about the dangers of concussion in his era, but he started to feel the effects later in life.\n\n\"Initially you have some aches and pains, I used to have a bit of back trouble,\" he said.\n\n\"I think for the first 20, 30 years you just go along with it and you can't say it was definitely related to rugby.\n\n\"But I think when you get to 55-plus, a little bit of memory loss, perhaps the recall, perhaps balance, those are some things starting to kick in, and you think: 'Concussion, dementia could it be something like that'?\"\n\nThere are other studies taking place investigating the health of former players. Lifestyle changes, including poor diet, alcohol dependency and lack of exercise may also accelerate the cognitive decline of former athletes.\n\nUSW researchers said they recognised this study had limitations in the relatively small sample size and it relies on participants remembering past concussions.\n\nBut they are aiming to carry out a larger study and investigate the potential differences in brain health between male and female athletes in contact sports.\n\nWorld Rugby previously said it \"welcomes all research that can inform and support our recently launched strategy to cement rugby as the most progressive sport on player welfare\" and undertook \"a wide-ranging evaluation of contact training\".\n\nIn 2021 it said: \"It is at the heart of everything that we say and do as a sport. World Rugby recently committed to double our investment in player welfare and new concussion research and initiatives.\"\n\nThe WRU has been asked to comment.", "A ban on fees to get rid of DIY waste in England will push up costs for all households, councils have warned.\n\nCurrently around a third of local authorities charge to dispose of DIY waste at recycling centres.\n\nThe government said the ban, which is expected to come into force later this year, aims to deter fly-tipping.\n\nBut the Local Government Association (LGA) said the costs would still be passed on, for example through higher council tax.\n\nThe organisation, which represents councils in England, said the change would cost many councils more than \u00a31m a year.\n\nSuffolk County Council said scrapping the charges would cost an estimated \u00a3500,000 a year, while Norfolk County Council said the cost would be more than \u00a31m a year.\n\nCharges to dispose of materials like paving slabs, plasterboard and bricks can be up to \u00a310 an item.\n\nThe LGA's environment spokesman, Darren Rodwell, said: \"Where councils are no longer able to charge for DIY waste at recycling centres the cost will be passed to all householders, including households that do not have a car and those with no possibility of carrying out building works, for example people living in rented accommodation.\"\n\nHe added: \"Manufacturers should also contribute to the costs to councils of clear up, by providing more take-back services so people can hand in sofas, old furniture and mattresses when they buy new ones.\"\n\nThe government said the change was part of its wider action to tackle fly-tipping, which costs the economy an estimated \u00a3924m a year in England.\n\nHowever, Mr Rodwell said evidence from councils and recycling campaign group Wrap did not show a link between charges and fly-tipping.\n\nEnvironment Minister Rebecca Pow said: \"We want to make it as easy as possible for people to dispose of their waste properly and that's why we are removing the financial burden on doing the right thing with DIY trash.\"\n\nJacob Hayler, executive director of the Environmental Services Association, which represents the waste management industry, said: \"We welcome any measures that make it easier for householders to dispose of waste correctly and responsibly at their local Household Waste Recycling Centre, which in turn reduces the chance of it falling into the hands of criminals or being fly-tipped.\"\n\nIn 2015, the government banned charges on local residents disposing of household rubbish at household waste centres.\n\nGuidance made clear this includes DIY household waste.

I sent personal letters explaining the situation and it wasn't good enough.\n\n\"In the end they said 'sorry' you have to leave the country.\n\n\"Then they wanted us to book her a flight to the UK, which we refused. So now the British embassy are having to look for accommodation and the police are on their backs.\n\n\"I think it's disgraceful really how you can deport somebody who is sick and take her from her family. She's one of the nicest people you will ever meet.\"\n\nThe family are now hoping a sick note from a doctor, who has visited Mrs Poole in person at her care home, will persuade the Swedish Migration Agency to reopen the case. But in the meantime, Angelica said her children remain worried sick that the grandmother may be sent away from them.\n\n\"It's not human to split somebody bedridden from her family,\" Angelica added.\n\n\"All this is due to Brexit. The way I see it she's lived here for 19 years this year.\"\n\nThe grandmother-of-four has been living in a care home in Sweden for the last ten years\n\nMP Hilary Benn, former Brexit Select Committee chair, has urged the UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, to intervene in the case.\n\nHe said: \"The continuing threat by the Swedish authorities to deport this frail elderly woman is heartless and inexplicable.\n\n\"It is also in clear breach of the EU/UK Withdrawal Agreement which promised to protect citizens' rights.\"\n\nThe follow-on legislation from Brexit, which ended freedom of movement, allowed EU citizens resident in Britain to apply to permanently live in the UK. Some EU nations also opted for this system to allow Britons to remain resident in their country.\n\nDavid Milstead, part of the British in Sweden campaign group, told the BBC he was disappointed but not surprised by Mrs Poole's case and that the UK and European Commission needed to look at the wider issue in the Scandinavian nation.\n\nHe said: \"Sweden's approach to implementing the Withdrawal Agreement has led to a lot of long-standing residents being forced out of their homes.\n\n\"Sweden has issued more deportation notices to UK nationals during 2021-2022 than any other EU country.\n\n\"This is in spite of the Withdrawal Agreement containing protections that should ensure that people like Mrs Poole get to stay. These protections clearly aren't working.\"\n\nSweden has expelled 1,100 British nationals since Brexit, according to the Guardian, which first reported Mrs Poole's case.\n\nJane Golding, chair of the British in Europe group and a Berlin-based lawyer, has written to the European Commission about Mrs Poole and said she understands they are following up the case with Swedish authorities.\n\nShe told the BBC: \"The problem that Kathleen Poole's family has come up against is that the UK and some EU countries including Sweden, decided to go for a system where citizens had to reapply for their status post-Brexit.\n\n\"We warned that it would be vulnerable and elderly people who would suffer as a result. People like Kathleen Poole - someone who has lived in another country for years and whose residence now depends on a successful application and is not capable of making the application herself.\n\n\"Each EU country implements the Withdrawal Agreement nationally and there are differences in approach. That is why guidance across the EU on cases involving the vulnerable and elderly who have problems applying would help.\"\n\nIn a statement, Sweden's Minister of Migration Maria Malmer Stenergard said: \"Decisions related to residence applications are applied directly by the Swedish state agencies and courts in line with the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement.\n\n\"As laid down in the constitution, the Swedish government is not permitted to interfere in or comment on individual decisions taken by these independent state bodies.\n\n\"With regard to the case in question, I have been informed that the Swedish Migration Agency is in contact with the family concerning additional information.\"\n\nA UK Foreign Office spokesperson said: \"We are supporting a British woman and her family in Sweden.\"", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: Biden spells out new path for student loan relief\n\nThe US Supreme Court has struck down US President Joe Biden's proposal to wipe out billions in student debt.\n\nThe 6-3 ruling effectively cancels the plan, which would have forgiven about $10,000 (\u00a37,800) per borrower - and up to $20,000 in some cases.\n\nThe decision affects the loans of more than 40 million Americans.\n\nIt has left the US public \"angry,\" Mr Biden said. He pledged to put in place new measures to reduce university debt using other existing laws.\n\nThe loan forgiveness plan has been in limbo since some conservative states sued, arguing the president overstepped his authority. The Supreme Court agreed.\n\nIn the wake of the decision, Mr Biden spoke from the White House, saying: \"I know there are millions of Americans in this country who feel disappointed and discouraged or even a little bit angry. I must admit I do too.\"\n\nBut he vowed to work with the Department of Education to find other means to help people ease the financial burden.\n\n\"Today's decision has closed one path. Now we're going to start another,\" he said.\n\nThe total federal student debt has more than tripled over the past 15 years, rising from about $500bn in 2007 to $1.6tn today.\n\nLast year, the US Treasury took a $430bn charge to cover $300m in costs associated with the loan forgiveness programme, as well as additional costs associated with an extension of a Covid-era moratorium on payments through the end of the year.\n\nThe Biden administration faced plaintiffs in two separate cases, one involving six Republican-led states - Nebraska, Missouri, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas and South Carolina - and the other involving two individual student loan borrowers.\n\nIn both cases, plaintiffs argued the executive branch did not have the power to so broadly cancel student debt.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled the two individual borrowers did not persuasively argue they would be harmed by the loan forgiveness plan, effectively ruling that they had no legal standing to challenge the Biden administration's proposal.\n\nDuring arguments in February, the Biden administration said that under a 2003 law known as the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act, or Heroes Act, it had the power to \"waive or modify\" loan provisions to protect borrowers affected by \"a war or other military operation or national emergency\".\n\nIn its ruling, the Supreme Court ruled that while the act allows Mr Biden's education secretary, Miguel Cardona, to \"make modest adjustments and additions to existing provisions, not transform them\".\n\nJustice John Roberts wrote that the modifications made by the Biden administration \"created a novel and fundamentally different\" loan forgiveness programme that \"expanded forgiveness to nearly every borrower\" in the US.\n\nHe added that the administration's use of the Heroes Act \"does not remotely resemble how it has been used on prior occasions\".\n\nThe high court's ruling fell along ideological lines, with its three liberal judges dissenting.\n\nIn her dissent, Justice Elena Kagan wrote that \"the result here is that the court substitutes itself for Congress and the Executive Branch in making national policy about student-loan forgiveness\".\n\n\"Congress authorised the forgiveness plan... the [education secretary] put it in place; and the president would have been accountable for its success or failure,\" she wrote.\n\n\"But this court today decides that some 40 million Americans will not receive the benefits of the plan (so says the court) that assistance is too 'significant'\".\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThe White House had previously estimated that almost 90% of US student borrowers would have qualified for relief under the plan.\n\n\"This decision is going to impact a lot of people in this country. But it's disproportionately going to impact people who are already historically marginalised,\" Ranen Miao, a 22-year-old recent graduate told BBC News outside the Supreme Court.\n\n\"The people who take out student loans are not the children of millionaires and billionaires. They're the children of working families,\" added Mr Miao, who declined to disclose how much student debt he has.\n\nClegg Ivey told CBS, the BBC's US partner, the Supreme Court had \"made the right decision\" and that he disagreed with the Biden administration's approach to the issue.\n\n\"I have student loans and I certainly would have benefited,\" he said. \"But if that's what we want, let's talk to our congressman. Congress... should actually do its job.\"\n\nPolling data shows that support for the student loan forgiveness proposal largely fell along political lines.\n\nOne poll conducted by Marquette Law School in May found that 31% of Republicans favoured the proposal, compared to 69% of independents and 87% of Democrats.\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling on Friday was swiftly applauded by senior Republican lawmakers.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said the loan initiative is \"unlawful\" and would mean that Americans without student loans \"are no longer forced\" to pay for those who do.\n\nIn total, approximately 43 million people in the US owe money for student loans - or about one-in-six US adults with at least some post-secondary education.\n\nFederal reserve data shows that the median student loan is about $17,000. About 17% of borrowers owe less than $10,000, while about 7% owe over $100,000.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nAmong those on the high end of the debt spectrum is Satra Taylor, a part-time student and campaigner for the group Young Invincibles who owes about $103,000. She told the BBC she expects the figure to grow as she continues a doctoral programme.\n\n\"My family does not come from generational wealth. I had no other option but to take out student loans to ensure I could put food on my table and pay my rent,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm deeply saddened by this decision... but I'm also hopeful that President Biden will ensure student debt cancellation happens.\"", "Tim Westwood worked for BBC Radio 1 for nearly 20 years\n\nFormer Radio 1 DJ Tim Westwood has been questioned for a third time under police caution over alleged sex offences, BBC News understands.\n\nIn a statement, the Metropolitan Police confirmed they are investigating five accusations of non-recent sexual offences, alleged to have taken place in London between 1982 and 2016.\n\nDetectives say they interviewed a 65-year-old man under caution on 15 March, 4 April, and 11 July this year.\n\nThere has been no arrest.\n\nThis comes after BBC News and Guardian investigations uncovered multiple allegations from 18 women of serious sexual misconduct and abuse by Tim Westwood. He denied those allegations.\n\nIn April 2022, a number of women accused Mr Westwood, who also worked as a DJ on BBC Radio 1Xtra, of predatory and unwanted sexual behaviour and touching, in incidents between 1992 and 2017.\n\nThey also accused him of abusing his position in the music industry. Some of the women told BBC News they encountered Mr Westwood when they were under 18. One said that she was only 14 when Mr Westwood first had sex with her.\n\nThe DJ stepped down from his Capital Xtra radio show in April last year.\n\nAn external report, by KC Gemma White, looking at what the BBC did and did not know about Mr Westwood's conduct during his near 20-year employment with the corporation, is due to be published this year.\n\nBBC News has tried to contact Mr Westwood for comment.", "Stephen Tompkinson told his trial he had acted in self-defence\n\nActor Stephen Tompkinson has been found not guilty of causing grievous bodily harm to a drunken man making noise outside his home.\n\nThe 57-year-old actor was accused of punching the man in the early hours of 30 May 2021 in Whitley Bay, North Tyneside.\n\nNewcastle Crown Court had heard Mr Tompkinson's actions caused Karl Poole to fall and fracture his skull.\n\nThe DCI Banks star said he acted in self-defence.\n\nProsecutors claimed he had \"snapped\" and \"lashed out\" at Mr Poole in \"disgust\" at his behaviour.\n\nBut Mr Tompkinson told jurors the contact \"wasn't enough to knock a sober man off his feet\".\n\nMr Tompkinson nodded but showed no visible emotion when the verdict was announced following just under two hours of jury deliberations.\n\nAsked for his reaction as he was leaving court, he told reporters: \"I just want to go home.\"\n\nThe trial heard Mr Poole and his friend Andrew Hall had been drinking since midnight that bank holiday Sunday and had gone to the beach before walking back.\n\nMr Tompkinson, who was living with his partner and her seven-year-old son at the time, heard \"strange noises\" at about 05:30 BST.\n\nJurors were told he called 999 after seeing the two men try to stand up and fall several times while drinking from a bottle of Jagermeister at the bottom of the driveway.\n\nWhile waiting to be connected, Mr Tompkinson went outside wearing pyjamas and a dressing gown and told the \"heavily intoxicated\" men who he was calling.\n\nHe said the pair \"took great objection to me complaining about them being there\" and had started to move towards him.\n\nKarl Poole had told the court he suffered a brain injury after his head hit the pavement\n\nNeighbour Caroline Davidson, who was watching from her bedroom window, told the court she saw Mr Tompkinson slap and punch Mr Poole, causing him to stumble and fall backwards, hitting his head on the ground.\n\nHowever, Mr Tompkinson, who was born in Stockton-on-Tees, said he could not have punched him because he was holding his phone.\n\n\"I didn't want to hurt him, I wanted to stop him to change his mind about coming towards me and further on to my property,\" he said giving evidence.\n\nHe told jurors punching a drunk man would have been \"career suicide\" and that he had already lost acting work since being charged.\n\nHe told the court he was \"not responsible\" for the brain injuries Mr Poole sustained but that he accepted some accountability.\n\nIn his closing speech, prosecutor Michael Bunch had said the actor was \"an expert in playing a part\" and his \"obvious talent makes him convincing in putting across a story\".\n\nSpeaking after the jury delivered its verdict, Mr Poole said he was shocked and disappointed.\n\nFollow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

The BBC has not commented.\n\nHe wrote on social media: \"Happy that this ridiculously out of proportion story seems to be abating and very much looking forward to presenting [Match of the Day] on Saturday. Thanks again for all your incredible support. It's been overwhelming.\"\n\nSuella Braverman told the BBC's Political Thinking podcast the Nazi comparison used by Lineker was \"lazy and unhelpful\".\n\nThe home secretary said her family \"feel very keenly the impact of the Holocaust\" as her husband is Jewish and said it was \"offensive\" to draw the comparison.\n\nWhen it was put to her by host Nick Robinson that Lineker was passionate about the rights of asylum seekers, she said the Germany comment was an \"unhelpful way to frame the debate\".\n\nThe BBC said on Wednesday it was having a \"frank conversation\" with Lineker about the BBC's guidelines on remaining impartial following his Twitter remark.\n\nAsked by a reporter if he regretted the post, the host answered: \"No\".\n\nPressed on whether he had spoken to the BBC director general, he said he had and that they \"chat often\". Asked if he stood by the tweet, he said: \"Course\".\n\nSpeaking in the Commons earlier on Thursday, Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer said Lineker's remark was \"disappointing and inappropriate\" and referenced her grandmother who escaped Nazi Germany.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

government to ensure \"all those who are presenters on the BBC\" - including freelancers like Lineker - were covered by impartiality rules when the charter was reviewed.\n\nBut Richard Sambrook, the BBC's former director of global news, said on Twitter it had \"become unsustainable for the BBC to force freelance presenters to fall in line with BBC policies in their non-BBC activities\".\n\nHe added that the policy was \"full of fudge\" and the BBC needed to clarify \"to what extent impartiality rules extend beyond news\".\n\nOn Tuesday, Suella Braverman outlined the government's plans to

against a number of associated companies and business directors.\n\nThe Home Office said the plans were necessary and that the asylum system was under \"incredible\" strain.\n\nThe local authority argued using the hotel for asylum seekers would be a breach of planning conditions.\n\nAt a High Court hearing on Friday, Carmarthenshire council failed to get an interim order stopping migrants being sent to the hotel while their asylum claims are processed by the Home Office.\n\nThe local authority claimed sending them to the 77-bed site was a change of use from hotel to hostel and a breach of planning rules.\n\nIt said the change, which is set to take effect from Monday, would \"undoubtedly\" harm the economy.\n\nThis included potentially losing more than 25% of the town's hotel rooms, job

the hotel would shut without its contract with accommodation provider Clearsprings Ready Homes.\n\nCraig Howell Williams KC, for the council, said there were \"good reasons\" to doubt Mr Horwood's claims the business could face closure.\n\nThe barrister said the former Edwardian stately home played a \"fundamental\" role in tourism.\n\nThe court was told there was limited information about how the site would be operated for migrants.\n\nThe use of bodyguards and perimeter patrols would be \"alien\" in the neighbourhood, Mr Howell Williams said.\n\nHe added there were \"concerns\" about community feeling, including the \"potential for unrest\".\n\nJenny Wigley KC, for Clearsprings, Gryphon, Mr Horwood and co-director Gareth Street, said in written arguments using the hotel was \"a

intensive care, was appointed as medical director and assistant chief executive of the NHS trust, in August 2018.\n\nHer arrival came a month after nurse Lucy Letby was arrested on suspicion of murdering seven babies and attempting to kill 10 others at one of the trust's hospitals in Cheshire. Ms Letby's trial is ongoing and she denies the charges.\n\nWhen the chief executive resigned in September that year, Dr Gilby was promoted to the role.\n\nAccording to documents prepared for a forthcoming employment tribunal, Dr Gilby alleges the problems began when a new chairman, Ian Haythornthwaite, was appointed in late 2021.\n\nShe claims that soon after joining the trust, Mr Haythornthwaite - a former BBC accountant - sought to \"intervene and influence, and ultimately to control, many operational matters\" beyond the scope of his job.\n\nDr Gilby's claim alleges that the chairman had an \"extremely and unnecessarily aggressive\" approach, with subordinates \"increasingly frightened of crossing him\".\n\nShe also accuses him of appointing friends to the trust's board and putting finance above patient safety.\n\nDr Gilby claims the chairman was \"highly aggressive and intimidatory\" in meetings, that he banged his hand on a desk to emphasise his point, and oversaw a climate where \"offensively sexist comments and ferocious and repetitive criticisms\" were made by either him or his associates.\n\nDr Gilby's complaint accuses the chairman of putting finance above patient safety at the hospital trust\n\nShe made a formal whistle-blowing complaint against the chairman in July 2022, raising her concerns about his behaviour to both the trust and NHS England.\n\nThe trust responded to her concerns, Dr Gilby claims, by proposing that she be seconded to a senior advisory role within NHS England on the condition she withdrew her allegations.\n\nNHS England also contacted her about a role. Dr Gilby responded to the offer in November saying she was not willing to withdraw her allegations; she was suspended by the trust on 2 December. On 5 December, she gave the trust six months' notice of her intention to resign.\n\nDr Gilby is suing the trust and Mr Haythornthwaite for constructive unfair dismissal.\n\nIn a statement, the Countess of Chester NHS Trust said: \"There are significant points of dispute between Dr Gilby and the trust and the trust denies all allegations that she has raised.

One local, Sean Montague, said people \"have to put your health first and be cautious\".\n\nAt the city's Inner Harbour, friends Sharifah and Sheila disembarked from a water taxi, eager to hurry indoors.\n\nThey said they originally planned to spend the day in Baltimore's Fells Point, a waterside neighbourhood known for its galleries, shops and outdoor seafood restaurants.\n\nBut once on the water, their eyes stung and the smoke was so thick, so they agreed the ride was \"miserable\" and decided to return home.\n\nMuch of the smoke is coming from Quebec, where 150 fires are burning. It is already Quebec's worst fire season on record.\n\nSome areas of Canada continued to experience very high levels of contamination on Thursday. The city of Janvier in Alberta, for example, had an AQI of 338, far above Washington DC's 293.\n\nMr Biden said he spoke to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Thursday and deployed more than 600 firefighters to help battle the blazes in Canada.\n\nOn a typical Thursday, Washington DC's Union Market would usually be packed with customers, dining al fresco in the afternoon sun.\n\nBut with smoke thick in the air, dozens of tables and chairs sat empty.

Watch: All sides should be responsible and protect civilians - UK PM\n\nRishi Sunak has urged all sides in Russia to \"be responsible and to protect civilians\", as mercenaries from the Wagner group seize military sites from Russia and Vladimir Putin vows to \"punish\" those involved in the move against his government.\n\nIn the UK, a meeting of the emergency committee, Cobra, was chaired by Foreign Secretary James Cleverly on Saturday afternoon.\n\nWe don't get to hear much about what is said in those meetings, but the government says Mr Cleverly received all the latest information and particular attention was paid to the situation of British nationals still in Russia.\n\nMr Sunak has also spoken to US President Biden, French President Macron and German Chancellor Scholz about the situation.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Sunak suggested the government has been watching the internal threats to Vladimir Putin for some time.\n\nHe told me: \"We have been monitoring for a while the potentially destabilising impacts of Russia's illegal war in Ukraine.\"\n\nAnd he said the situation was \"evolving on the ground as we speak\".\n\nBut he urged calm on all sides, saying: \"The most important thing I'd say is for all parties to be responsible and to protect civilians\", a clear hint that the UK is concerned about how conflict inside Russia's borders could spiral, when for months the focus has naturally been on fighting in Ukraine.\n\nThe prime minister did not repeat a more candid assessment from the Ministry of Defence, which said on its official Twitter feed that \"this represents the most significant challenge to the Russian state in recent times\".\n\nBut Mr Sunak did not deny that was the case.\n\nWith so much unclear, it is evident that Number 10 does not yet want to give an official verdict on what is happening.\n\nYet it is clear from the Ministry of Defence's comments that the government sees the action taking place as a potential game changer.\n\nThe situation is volatile and no-one in Westminster would predict with any certainty what will happen next.\n\nIt is not clear exactly what Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin's motives are.\n\nNor is it certain how many resources and men Wagner really has at their disposal.\n\nBut one of the questions being asked in Westminster this afternoon is how Ukraine can make the most of what seems like disarray inside Russia to make progress in what is now a long-running conflict.\n\nOur politicians, like the rest of us, are watching events and wondering what on earth is going on, and unable to be sure what will happen next. But they are watching with eager attention.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has had such enormous implications for politicians in the UK, because it has indirectly affected every family, every firm, and every household in the country by driving up the cost of energy.\n\nThat's one of the biggest factors in high inflation the prime minister describes as the \"number one enemy\".\n\nWe talk to the prime minister about that, his plans for the NHS and Boris Johnson in an exclusive interview you can watch on Sunday morning.\n\nBut as events unfold in Russia, remember that the actions of one man, Vladimir Putin, upended so much here.\n\nMoscow may be nearly 2,000 miles away, but what happens in the next few days to stability in Russia matters hugely to our politicians in Westminster, and to us all.", "Formal identification of the boy who died has yet to take place\n\nAn 18-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a 17-year-old boy was stabbed following a birthday party in north-west London.\n\nPolice and London Ambulance Service were called to Granville Road, Kilburn, at 23:22 BST on Friday following reports of a fight and a stabbing.\n\nA 17-year-old boy was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nAnother teenage boy and a woman in her early 20s were treated at the scene before being taken to hospital.\n\nFormal identification of the boy who died has yet to take place.\n\nDet Ch Insp Mark Rogers said: \"We believe that there was a fight following a birthday party, which would have been attended by a number of people.\n\n\"I would urge anyone who was there, and who has not yet spoken with officers, to please come forward.\n\n\"It is vital that we establish what happened.\"\n\nCh Supt Dan Knowles, in charge of the North West Command Unit which polices Kilburn, said: \"I know that the community will be shocked by this incident in which a young man has lost his life.\"\n\nFollow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Substitute goalkeeper Archie Mair, brought on to replace Sam Slocombe in the 120th minute, crucially saved spot-kicks from Darren Oldaker and Jeff King before Cedwyn Scott sealed a dramatic 4-3 shootout triumph. Victory for the 161-year-old Magpies, who were founder members of the Football League in 1888, ended their four-year non-league exile while defeat consigned Chesterfield to a sixth season in the National League. Ruben Rodrigues had bounced a volley off the turf and over goalkeeper Ross Fitzsimons to level at 2-2 in the second half of extra time to ensure the showdown would be decided from the spot. Armando Dobra's curled finish had restored Chesterfield's lead in the first period of 15 additional minutes after an enthralling game ended 1-1 at the end of normal time. A calamitous start from Notts goalkeeper Slocombe - which had the Magpies defending a rare indirect free-kick inside the box after just two minutes - cost them dearly as his challenge on Andrew Dallas allowed the striker to put Chesterfield ahead from the spot. The Spireites had Notts scrambling to stay in touch at the break as the side that won a club-record 32 league games during the regular season struggled to muster a meaningful response. Sam Austin sent a shot over the bar from the edge of the area and Connell Rawlinson wastefully steered a header wide for a much-improved Notts after the break. Liam Mandeville squandered a late chance to seal victory moments before experienced Notts midfielder John Bostock caught Fitzsimons out with a set-piece that skipped in at the near post. Dobra edged the Derbyshire club back ahead three minutes after the restart and, after Macaulay Langstaff and Rawlinson went close to again restoring parity, it was Rodrigues who sent the final to a shootout.\n\u2022 None Relive the National League promotion final as it happened After four years and three failed play-off attempts - including defeat by Harrogate in a 2020 promotion final played behind closed doors at Wembley during the Covid-19 pandemic - Notts finally secured their English Football League (EFL) return at the end of a record-breaking season. Luke Williams' side were pipped for automatic promotion and the title by Hollywood-funded Wrexham, who topped the table with an all-time high 111 points. The 107 points the Magpies collected to finish second would have got them straight up as champions in every other season before this one. The club-record wins total and 117 goals in a campaign - which included a record 25-game unbeaten league run between September and February - would have counted for nothing if they had lost at the national stadium. Chesterfield finished one spot below Notts in the table, but the gap between the two was 23 points. They were the only side, other than Wrexham and Notts, to have a spell at the top of the table after the first month of the season - and they pushed Notts to their limits at Wembley in an incredible energy-sapping game. Chesterfield were presented with a bizarre chance almost immediately after kick-off when County conceded an indirect free-kick in the penalty area. Notts set their entire side up a yard in front of the goalline to block King's effort from the left of the penalty spot, but the uncertain start by the Magpies quickly got worse. Slocombe raced out to try shut Dallas down on the edge of the area, but caught the Spireites forward as he tried to lift the ball beyond the keeper. Dallas collected himself and went straight down the middle to beat Slocombe from the spot to put Chesterfield ahead after five chaotic minutes. Nervy Notts struggled to match frenetic Chesterfield for much of the first half, but Austin had a chance to level from close range in the 17th minute when he stretched to meet a lofted cross from Aaron Nemane. Dallas continued to torment Notts' backline down the left, calling Slocombe into action as the forward attempted pull a dangerous ball back across goal. It was not until the 37th minute that Notts managed to register a shot on goal with Nemane sending an effort directly into Fitzsimons' hands. Austin and Rawlinson were off target in search of a second-half equaliser, only for Bostock to deliver with a clever free-kick after a Slocombe error at the other end almost gifted Chesterfield the win in normal time. Dobra had Chesterfield ahead again in extra time and while Langstaff went close to adding to his National League record 42 goals and Rawlinson also flashed a chance wide, it was Rodrigues who salvaged Notts' hopes. On-loan keeper Mair, in just his fifth game for Notts, played an instrumental role off the bench with his penalty saves and, after Bostock made a mess of his spot-kick to seal it, Scott kept his cool to secure victory.\n\u2022 None Penalty missed!

If anyone wants to try and beat the record, I'm willing to help them,\" he said.\n\nAs for his plans on completing the marathon, he said: \"The first thing I'll be looking to do is find somewhere comfortable to sit down and probably just fall asleep.\"", "All except the shortest wars have times when killing is an unchanging, grim routine. There are also moments, like the last few days in the Middle East, when events leave belligerents and their allies at a crossroads with big decisions to make.\n\nChoices are confronting leaders in the governments and armed forces in Israel and Tehran, at Hezbollah's HQ in the southern suburbs of Beirut and further afield in the Gulf, Europe and America.\n\nThe killing of foreign aid workers in Gaza might finally exhaust the considerable patience of Israel's allies, led by the United States.\n\nIsrael and Egypt have banned foreign journalists from entering Gaza, except on occasional, highly controlled and brief visits with the Israeli military. Belligerents need to win the media battle in an age of asymmetric warfare where victory or defeat can rely on perceptions as much as the realities of battle. Journalists are also denied access to a war when the parties fighting it have something to hide.\n\nBut even without foreign reporters on the scene, evidence is piling up that Israel is not, as it claims, respecting its obligations under the laws of war to respect civilian lives, or allowing the free movement of aid in a famine created by Israel's own actions. After the World Central Kitchen team was killed in Gaza, President Biden used his strongest language yet in public statements to condemn Israel's actions.\n\nThe president and his aides have now to decide whether words are enough. So far, they have resisted calls to put conditions on the use of American weapons in Gaza, or even to turn off the supply line.\n\nWhile the weapons still arrive, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who depends on hardline Jewish ultranationalists to stay in office, might feel he can still afford to defy President Biden. A major test will be the offensive Israel wants to attack Hamas in Rafah, plans the US believes would compound the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. American interests and Joe Biden's political prospects in an election year have already been damaged by what is seen in many countries as complicity with Israel.\n\nIn another change this week, Mr Netanyahu has come back to work after two days off for hernia surgery to huge demonstrations demanding his resignation and early elections for a new parliament. Deep cultural and political fissures between Israelis that were put to one side after 7 October are wide open again and being shouted about in the streets. The prime minister is in political trouble, blamed by his opponents for letting down Israel's guard so badly that Hamas detected a chance to attack.\n\nMillions of Israelis who believe they are fighting a just war against Hamas have no confidence in Mr Netanyahu. Their charge sheet includes prolonging the war to put off the moment when he is held accountable for his mistakes, failing to bring Israel's hostages home safely, and alienating vital allies starting with President Biden. Add to that the fact that after a huge onslaught over six months Hamas is still fighting, and its senior leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar is still alive somewhere in the Strip.\n\nAnother new set of calculations about the next stages of the crisis in the Middle East arise from the assassination of a senior Iranian general in Damascus, widely assumed in Israel to be the work of its air force. It was a coup for intelligence services that missed or ignored the Hamas attacks six months ago. It was also an escalation in the wider war in the region that will have consequences.\n\nSome of them may happen close to where I'm writing this, looking across the Sea of Galilee towards the Golan Heights, the large swathe of southern Syria that Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed. As the crow flies, Damascus is less than 50 miles from here. The border with Lebanon is close by. At night, especially, there is constant Israeli air activity, with the roar of jets on patrol, or heading off to bomb Lebanon or Syria.\n\nA shadow war has been fought here in parallel with the war in Gaza since last October. It started with Hezbollah, the powerful Lebanese militia and political movement attacking Israel, in support of Hamas in Gaza. It was not the onslaught that the Hamas leadership was hoping for - neither Hezbollah or its patrons in Tehran wanted an all-out war with Israel and, indirectly, its American backers. The Americans did not want that either and restrained Israel's instinct to respond in full force.\n\nBut Hezbollah still tied down thousands of Israeli troops and forced the evacuation of something like 80,000 civilians from the border areas. Israel's response, limited compared to earlier border wars, forced the displacement of at least as many civilians on the Lebanese side.\n\nSince the start of this year it has been different. Israel has been setting the pace, bombing its enemies deeper inside Lebanon and Syria. The biggest leap up the ladder of escalation came on Monday with the assassination by air strike on the Iranian diplomatic compound in the Syrian capital.\n\nIran accuses Israel of carrying out the deadly air strike on its consular building in Damascus\n\nIn interviews here in northern Israel local officials and residents have expressed strong support not just for the assassination but for an invasion of south Lebanon to destroy Hezbollah and force them back from the border.\n\nThey were not put off by Israel's experience in the last two decades of the 20th Century, when it occupied a broad strip of South Lebanon to try to protect northern Israel. It even created its own Lebanese militia to help with the fighting. The Israelis pulled out in 2000, under constant military harassment from Hezbollah, after prime minister Ehud Barak, a former head of the army, decided that occupying south Lebanon (Israel called it the \"security zone\") did not make Israelis any safer and wasted the lives of its troops.\n\nI walked through the ruins of the Avivim winery, which is right on the border wire. It was destroyed in a Hezbollah strike last week. Its owner Shlomi Biton showed me through the wreck of his business. He is 47 and was born in Avivim, which like the rest of northern Israel has become a ghost town after the evacuations. Shlomi fought in Lebanon during his military service, and now believes that the only way to restore a decent and safe life is for Israel to return to Lebanon for a decisive battle with Hezbollah.\n\n\"There's no other choice,\" he told me next his burnt-out business. \"Otherwise, the community won't return to live here, maybe just a few crazy guys like me - the children won't come back.\"\n\nIn Kiryat Shmona, a border town where 25,000 Israelis lived, no more than 3,000 people, mostly soldiers and essential workers, are left. The Mayor, Avichai Stern, showed me deserted districts and wrecked buildings. He believes that Israel can remove Hezbollah's threat to the north with a decisive and destructive invasion on the lines of the Gaza war.\n\nThe Mayor of Kyriat Shmona, Avichai Stern shows fragment of shrapnel from a Hezbollah strike on residential buildings in the town\n\nMayor Stern said last year 10,000 Hezbollah fighters practised taking over northern Israel.\n\n\"It can happen here\" he told me, \"just like Gaza. They weren't training to direct traffic in Beirut. The only way to stop it is to go into Lebanon eliminate this threat as soon as possible.\"\n\nExactly six months ago, in deadly secrecy, Hamas was putting the finishing touches to the battle plan it called Operation al-Aqsa flood. The killing on 7 October and everything that has followed destroyed lazy, wishful thinking that it was possible to manage the century-long conflict between Arabs and Jews for control of the land between the river Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nHamas thrust the conflict back to the top of the world's agenda when it killed around 1,200 people, mostly Israeli civilians, and took more than 250 Israelis and foreign citizens into Gaza as hostages. Many of the 134 Israelis still there are thought to be dead. It was Israel's worst single day since it won its independence war in 1948.\n\nThe \"mighty vengeance\" that Mr Netanyahu promised has so far killed more than 32,000 Palestinians, a majority of whom were civilians. Israel's American-supplied firepower has flattened most of Gaza. The war has spread across the Middle East. It might now be entering a new phase.\n\nThe borderlands between Israel and Lebanon are deceptively beautiful in the first few weeks of spring. Wild flowers and pinecones, not shrapnel, were underfoot as I walked along a stretch of the border with Israeli military officers. Any sense of peace was, of course, an illusion on one of the most dangerous borders in the Middle East. Iran and Hezbollah are making decisions about how to respond to the assassinations in the Damascus and the way Israel is increasing the military pressure in Lebanon. The two allies will want to calibrate their response to avoid a wider, devastating war that neither want.\n\nIsrael does not want that war either. But the audacious assassination at the Iranian diplomatic compound in Damascus could be a sign that Israel believes Iran and the network it calls its axis of resistance might blink first. If so, it is a risky strategy. Iran will want to restore its ability to deter Israel, which is clearly not working. It will try to respond in a way that will catch Israel by surprise.\n\nThe empty overgrown border communities are not likely to be Iran's first choice for retaliation. They could try an Israeli target in another country, or cyber-attacks rather than missiles. Or intensify their nuclear programme.\n\nAn American envoy, Amos Hochstein, is trying to find a way to revive the UN Security Council resolution that ended the last big war between Hezbollah and Israel in 2006. Neither side has respected it, but it provides a framework for negotiation.\n\nAt this crossroads, neither Israel, Iran nor Hezbollah wants an all-out war that would have terrible consequence for all of them. But no side seems ready to stop the slide towards it.", "Don't trust anyone who tells you they know the political implications of this indictment.\n\nI certainly don't, and nor do they.

I really do think we will make it [money] back.\"\n\nAn independently club-owned, club-run body is poised to take over the Women's Super League and the Women's Championship next year as the English women's game looks to capitalise on its rapid rise, accelerated by the Lionesses' success at Euro 2022.\n\nA recent report by Deloitte showed Women's Super League club revenues rose by 60% in the 2021-22 season, showing signs of growth before even England's historic Euro 2022 victory.\n\nCombined revenue for the WSL clubs was \u00a332m, an increase of \u00a312m on the previous season thanks in part to a new broadcast deal, however clubs still recorded an aggregate pre-tax loss of \u00a314m.\n\nCarney's findings have focused on several areas including audience reach and growth, the financial health of the game, its long-term financial sustainability and its existing structures - leading to 10 major recommendations, that include:\n\u2022 None World leading standards for players, fans, staff, and everyone in the women's game.\n\u2022 None To restore the talent pathway needed to create future generations of Lionesses.\n\u2022 None Professionalisation across the top two tiers to attract and develop the best players in the world.\n\u2022 None To address the lack of diversity across the women's game - in on- and off-pitch roles.\n\u2022 None The game's governing bodies to work with broadcasters to create a new dedicated time slot.\n\u2022 None More investment in grassroots facilities and better access for females.\n\nCarney, who has worked in the media since her retirement from playing in 2019, was asked to examine issues affecting the game at elite and grassroots levels in September 2022. by the UK government.\n\nThe women's game has made huge progress in recent years and, at grassroots level, has become the most played team sport for women and girls in England, with three million registered players and over 12,000 registered teams.\n\nHowever, both the Covid-19 pandemic and the men's game fan-led review highlighted the shallow resources within women's elite football.\n\nShe appointed a number of experts from across sport and business, including a senior NFL executive, with the UK Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer calling it an opportunity to \"revolutionise the game\" in a positive and sustainable way.\n\nIn a statement the chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) Maheta Molango called the report a \"brave, ambitious and detailed plan for the future of women's game\".\n\nAn FA spokeswoman said they would help \"address the challenges and opportunities in the report\" to \"deliver the changes needed\".\n\nThey said: \"These are exciting times for the development of the women's game and we share Karen's vision of creating world leading standards for players, fans, and everyone involved in women's football.\"\n\nWhile the 12-club WSL is fully professional that does not extend to English women's football's second tier.\n\nA significant drop in broadcast fees and FA central funding means that turnovers can be as high as around \u00a37m in the WSL but as low as \u00a3150,000 in the Women's Championship, where player wages can be below \u00a35,000 per year.\n\nReading's recent relegation from the WSL saw them revert to part-time football due to the financial implications.\n\nWhen it was put to Carney that more than \u00a310m would be required to redress some of that balance, she passionately defended the need to attract additional income to the game.\n\n\"Do I want players to have to go on the NHS [for treatment of injuries]? No. Do I want players to have to use bin bags for curtains? No,\" she said.\n\n\"I don't want any of this situation any more. There was a lot of evidence in the review of the marketing strategy in place not being able to help the revenues grow.\n\n\"It is what is needed. It is not a negative to invest in women's sport, we have to change the mindset. I understand there is a reality to it.\"\n\nOn proposals to provide one source of funding from levelling FA Cup prize money across the men's and women's game, she added: \"I'd hope there would not be a backlash.\n\n\"There are so many issues and women's sport has struggled for so long I'd hope there'd be an understanding but with anything there'll always be someone who will challenge it.\n\n\"I could have said equalise prize money right now but that would have taken down the pyramid of men's football. We should absolutely be going for equal prize money [in the future] from the FA Cup and the FA should be putting a timescale on that.\"\n\n'Five weeks out can turn into five months' - injury improvements\n\nA long-standing issue that Carney is keen to see addressed urgently is the relative lack of medical support offered to female players in comparison to their male counterparts.\n\nA Fifa report in 2021 showed that a quarter of top-division women's clubs around the world do not employ a physio or team doctor and while there have been improvements Carney says there are still issues around the quality and continuity of care provided.\n\n\"There was a player who should have been out for five weeks and was out five months,\" Carney said.\n\n\"We've seen players pretty much say we are going to have to go into early retirement because of the medical situation. It is a systemic issue about women's health not just in sport but outside, it has to be better.\n\n\"Don't forget in the Championship there are players working three of four jobs. They are never going to be able to compete and it is not because they don't have the ability, it is the resources.\n\n\"Are they hydrated? Are they getting the right nutrients to perform? Are they fatigued? That is why we want minimum standards to come in to keep that competitive nature.\n\n\"We want all our players to be fit, available and playing because then the product is at its best because that's what the fans, broadcasters and players want.\"\n\nFootball's governing bodies have talked of exploring whether WSL fixtures can be televised on Saturday afternoons to help grow the audience.\n\nLast term, WSL matches consistently kicked off at 11.30am on Saturdays and 6.45pm on Sundays to avoid scheduling clashes with men's games.\n\nNo matches are currently shown during the '3pm blackout' slot in order to encourage attendance at games.\n\nHowever, Carney believes there is no simplistic solution: \"It's very clear we need to find a slot specific for women's football.\n\n\"Men's football is really easily signposted, it is really difficult for women's football to have a slot and stand out.\n\n\"We have to look at it, it is a really saturated market and this is what we are up against.\"\n\n'We need to keep pushing' - improving diversity\n\nCarney's 'raising the bar' review also identifies the need to create a workforce strategy for the women's game and the need to create greater diversity on and off the pitch.\n\nFormer Brighton defender Fern Whelan, who is now an equalities executive at the PFA, echoed those comments in response to the report.\n\n\"We can all see that there is a lack of representation across the women's game,\" Whelan said.\n\n\"That isn't by design, or something the game needs to be defensive about. It's something where we've acknowledged there is an issue and begun to take action, but we need to keep pushing.\n\n\"It's positive that the review has highlighted the lack of diversity across the women's game as something that needs to be urgently addressed.\n\n\"Are we doing enough to encourage girls and young women from diverse backgrounds into the game? Are we making the professional pathway accessible enough? It's often about practicalities as well as culture.\"\n\nThis is a highly significant moment in English women's football.\n\nThe report has strong backing from the PFA and FifPro, who have worked closely with the review board to ensure players from all backgrounds have been able to share their experiences in confidence.\n\nThere is a range of issues which will need long-term vision and patience to adapt to, but there are also clear short-term recommendations.\n\nAmong the most crucial are improved medical support, calls for fully funded union representation, better prize money and a dedicated WSL broadcast spot - all of which can be addressed immediately.\n\nThere are no legal enforcements given its an independent report, but the simple fact so many have come together to provide a detailed review suggests it will be hard for the likes of the FA - and the WSL takeover company - to ignore.", "Ukraine found the remains of British World War Two Hurricane aircraft in a forest outside Kyiv\n\nThe rusting remains of eight British Hurricane fighter planes dating back to World War Two have been found buried in a forest in Ukraine.\n\nThe aircraft were sent to the Soviet Union by Britain after Nazi Germany invaded the country in 1941.\n\nThey were part of a package of allied military support for the USSR, paid for by the United States under the so-called Lend-Lease scheme.\n\nSimilar legislation is being used by the US government today to send military aid to Ukraine as it seeks to expel Russian forces from its country.\n\nAviation experts say this is the first time the remains of so many Hurricanes have been found in Ukraine.\n\n\"It is very rare to find this aircraft in Ukraine,\" says Oleks Shtan, a former airline pilot who is leading the excavation. \"It's very important for our aviation history because no Lend-Lease aircraft have been found here before.\"\n\nThe UK sent some 3,000 Hurricanes to the Soviet Union during the war against Nazi Germany\n\nThe Hawker Hurricane was the workhorse of the Battle of Britain - the air campaign of 1940 when the Royal Air Force (RAF) defeated German attempts to invade the UK. Although its role has often been overshadowed by the newer and more adaptable Spitfire plane, the Hurricane actually shot down more than half of all enemy aircraft during the battle.\n\n\"The Hurricane was a strong, easy to fly machine,\" Mr Shtan says. \"It was stable as a gun platform and suitable for inexperienced pilots. A reliable aircraft.\"\n\nIn total, about 3,000 Hurricanes were sent to the USSR between 1941 and 1944 to support the Soviet war effort. Most were either destroyed in combat or dismantled later for parts.\n\nBut some Hurricanes were deliberately broken up and buried after the war so the Soviets did not have to pay back the United States. Under the Lend-Lease legislation, the USSR was required to pay for any donated military equipment that remained intact after hostilities ended.\n\nThis was the fate of the eight Hurricanes found buried in woodland south of Kyiv - now the capital of independent Ukraine, but until 1991 part of the USSR.\n\nUkraine is now painstakingly cleaning and repairing the planes, so they can be put on display\n\nThey had been stripped of their instruments, radios, machine guns and any useful scrap metal. They were then dragged by tractors from a nearby airfield, broken up and dropped without ceremony into a shallow ravine. It is thought they were then covered with earth by bulldozers.\n\nThe remains were discovered recently after an unexploded bomb dating from the war was found nearby. The rest of the ravine was checked using metal detectors and the Hurricanes were found.\n\nThe National Aviation Museum of Ukraine is now in the process of painstakingly excavating the site by hand. Staff there aim to identify as much of the aircraft as possible so they can be reassembled and put on display.\n\nValerii Romanenko, head of research at the museum, says the Hurricanes played an important part in Ukraine's history.\n\n\"The Hurricanes are a symbol of British assistance during the years of the Second World War, just as we are very appreciative of British assistance nowadays,\" he says. \"The UK is one of the largest suppliers of military equipment to our country now.\"\n\nThe Hurricanes are a symbol of British assistance... just as we are very appreciative of British assistance now\n\n\"In 1941 Britain was the first who supplied fighter aircraft to the Soviet Union in mass scale. Now the UK is the first country which gives Storm Shadow cruise missiles to our armed forces.\"\n\nIt is thought there are just 14 restored Hurricanes able to fly in the world today.\n\nAfter the German invasion, the USSR lost many warplanes and was in desperate need of fighter aircraft. Initially several RAF Hurricane squadrons were sent to the Arctic to help.\n\nBut soon the British pilots left and the aircraft were taken over by Soviet airmen. Records show that many disliked the Hurricane, considering it under-powered, under-armed and under-protected.\n\nBy the end of the war it was considered obsolete and was used mainly for air defence work. The eight Hurricanes found south of Kyiv were used to defend major transport hubs - especially railway stations and junctions.", "Bryn Parry founded Help for Heroes with his wife Emma\n\nThe Prince of Wales has paid tribute to a co-founder of Wiltshire-based veterans' charity Help for Heroes following his death from pancreatic cancer.\n\nBryn Parry passed away on Wednesday at the age of 66, the charity said.\n\nMr Parry and his wife Emma founded Help for Heroes in 2007 after learning about ex-servicemen's struggles to access rehabilitation treatment.\n\nPrince William described him as \"a life-affirming and inspirational man\".\n\nIn a tweet, the prince said he was \"deeply sad to hear that Bryn Parry has passed away\".\n\n\"A life-affirming, inspirational man, his work with @HelpforHeroes made a difference to so many and his legacy will be its continuing impact.\"\n\nPrince William visited a Help For Heroes Recovery Centre in Tidworth in 2013\n\nPrince Harry also expressed his condolences in a statement published on his own veteran's charity, the Invictus Games Foundation.\n\n\"Today is a truly sad day for the military community as we bid farewell to a man who, alongside his wife, completely transformed the UK charity sector for the benefit of those that have served,\" he wrote.\n\n\"His vision, determination and brilliance provided a lifeline for thousands of veterans, as well as their families, when they needed it most.\"\n\nThe minister for veterans' affairs, Johnny Mercer, also paid tribute, saying Mr and Mrs Parry had \"revolutionised veterans' care in the UK\".\n\nThe MP for Plymouth, Moor View, added: \"(Mr Parry) inspired me with his unapologetic determination to do the right thing by these men and women who serve.\n\n\"He will never be forgotten.\"\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

It is described as a mountain range roughly 10km from the closest inhabited area, at an altitude of around 1,000m (3,280ft).\n\nNobody was injured and no material damage has been reported.\n\nThe scientific instrument onboard the rocket, known as the payload, weighs 387kg (853lbs) and has since been recovered in \"good condition\" and returned to Esrange by helicopter, according to the SSC.\n\nSSC spokesman Philip Ohlsson explained that while the first stage motor of the rocket had landed close to the Esrange base site in Sweden, the second stage motor and the payload had parachuted on to Norwegian territory.\n\n\"This is a deviation that we take seriously,\" said Marko Kohberg from the Esrange Space Center. \"It is still too early to speculate about the cause, and we await more information from the current investigation.\"\n\nAccording to Esrange, Norway's armed forces and Swedish authorities were contacted shortly after the incident, and it followed the routines laid out for rocket launches after Monday's flight.\n\nLocal authorities in Malselv have told public broadcaster NRK they were told about the incident and asked if a helicopter could be sent to retrieve the rocket.\n\nBut Norway's foreign ministry has said it received no formal notification either of the rocket's landing or the recovery of its payload.\n\n\"For our part it's important to remember that a rocket and incident like this can contribute to large damage. The fuel might be contaminated and there might be poisonous material. We just want to expect the proper rules are followed,\" said Ms Simenstad.\n\nThe rocket, known as Texus-58, is part of a European programme commissioned by the European Space Agency.", "Researchers say the new genetic map of humanity is more representatives of variety\n\nScientists have produced an updated map of all human DNA which could help to transform medical research.\n\nThe original human genome, published 20 years ago, is mostly from one person, and does not represent human diversity.\n\nThe latest version - dubbed the pangenome - is made up of data from 47 people from Africa, Asia, the Americas and Europe.\n\nIt is hoped it will lead to new drugs and treatments that work for a much wider range of people.\n\nAccording to Dr Eric Green, who is director for the National Human Genome Research Institute in Bethesda Maryland, the research, which has been published in the journal Nature, has the potential to transform medical research.\n\n\"This represents a tremendous scientific achievement. A pangenome that better reflects the diversity of the human population will enable scientists to better understand how genetic variation influences health and disease and moves us to a future in which genomic medicine benefits everyone\".\n\nThe genes that make up human DNA are made up of of sequences of chemicals.\n\nThe pangenome consists of 47 separate DNA maps of the people from different ancestries, which can also be combined and compared with new software tools to find important genetic differences.\n\nThe aim is to develop more effective treatments for more people, but genetic scientists are aware that the research has the potential to be misused. Prof Muzlifah Haniffa, of the Sanger Institute in Newcastle, who was not part of the research team, said that the science should not be misinterpreted,\n\n\"Genetic information about diversity should be used responsibly and not to provide evidence of differences in race, which is a social construct. We have to understand what it shows and, importantly, what it doesn't show. We have to make sure that taking information very superficially to establish false racial characteristics does not happen\".\n\nThe human genome was largely completed in 2003. It is a map of the basic chemical building blocks that make up human DNA. Researchers use it to identify genes involved in diseases so as to develop better treatments. It has led to improved cancer therapies and the development of tests to predict the onset of inherited conditions, such as Huntington's disease.\n\nIt took hundreds of machines 13 years to read all the DNA that makes a human\n\nBut the downside is that 70% of the genome came from a single individual: an American man with European and African ancestry. This therefore misses important genetic differences that play an important part in diseases in people from other backgrounds, according to Dr Karen Miga of the university of California in Santa Cruz.\n\n\"Having one map of a single human genome cannot adequately represent all of humanity. This reboot can be the foundation for the scientific community to have more equitable healthcare in the future\".\n\nAlthough the map of the human genome currently used by researchers has a lot of African DNA in it, counterintuitively it is the population that is one of the most lacking, according to Dr Ewan Birney, deputy Director General of the European Molecular Biology Lab near Cambridge.\n\n\"The most important place in the World to get genomes from is sub-Saharan Africa. It is where we started as a species, and it has the greatest genetic diversity. So, one African American genome is not enough to represent that diversity\".\n\nDr Zamin Iqbal, a senior researcher at EMBL's European Bioinformatics Institute near Cambridge, believes that a more representative genome will lead to better treatments for more people.\n\n\"Expanding the range of populations present in the human reference genome will reduce a long-standing implicit bias in studies of human genetics. Humans are diverse, and it's important that our analytical methods incorporate that.\n\nTwo recent studies in the US and in the UK and Ireland found that children of European ancestry were twice as likely to be diagnosed with genetic tests than those of African ancestry.\n\nDr Alexander Arguello, who is the programme director at at the National Human Genome Research Institute, says the aim of the new project was to change those outcomes.\n\n\"The hope is that once you capture sufficient diversity you will get the same diagnostic results whatever the population\".\n\nThe new pangenome is made up from 47 people, half of whom have ancestry from sub-Saharan Africa, a third from the Americas, 13% from China and 2% from Europe, with representation of indigenous people.\n\nBut this is just the start of an ambitious programme to better represent the diversity of the world's population. The initial aim is to increase the number to 350. After that the scientists leading the largely US programme plan to increase numbers and diversity further by working with organisations from other countries in what they hope will become phase two of the human genome project.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "The settlement is separate from the Grenfell Tower Inquiry, which started in September 2017\n\nLawyers acting for survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire and bereaved family members have been outlining the details of a civil damages claim settlement.\n\nAt the High Court, barrister Richard Hermer KC said a compensation sum of about \u00a3150m had been awarded across 900 cases in the \"global settlement\".\n\nThe June 2017 fire at the west London tower block killed 72 people.\n\nMeanwhile, it has now been confirmed the Grenfell Inquiry report is unlikely to be published until 2024.\n\nThe panel and team working on the phase two report have insisted they will \"spare no effort\" to finish it as soon as possible.

although the UK has no supply of the drug yet.\n\nThe new scheme will test how GPs could safely prescribe such drugs and the NHS provide support in the community or digitally, contributing to the government's wider ambition to reduce pressure on hospitals and give patients access to the care they need where it is most convenient for them.\n\nSemaglutide injections will be approved under NICE guidance\n\nMr Sunak said: \"Obesity puts huge pressure on the NHS.\n\n\"Using the latest drugs to support people to lose weight will be a game-changer by helping to tackle dangerous obesity-related health conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes and cancer.\"\n\nProfessor Kamila Hawthorne, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, welcomed the move but said there would need to be \"sufficient resource and funding to account for the increased workload\".\n\nShe added that there also needs to be enough of the drug available \"so as not to raise patients' expectations, as there may be a significant number of people who would benefit from it\".\n\nSpeaking to BBC Breakfast, Health Secretary Steve Barclay pointed to the impact obesity has on rates of cancer and diabetes.\n\nHe continued: \"We recognise it's often a real challenge for people to lose weight or keep the weight off, and that's why we're embracing the latest medication and making sure the NHS is at the front of the queue.\"\n\nMr Barclay also said there could be \"potential economic benefits\" from reducing the numbers of people absent from work because of health issues linked to obesity.\n\nThe government says obesity costs the NHS in England \u00a36.5 billion a year, with more than one million hospital admissions linked to obesity in 2019-20.\n\nMore than 12 million adults in England are obese, estimates suggest.\n\nAnd some High Street chemists are set to sell Wegovy to customers, prescribing and dispensing a weekly jab they can inject themselves using pre-filled pen devices.\n\nAs with any medication, there can be side-effects and risks.\n\nThe most common are nausea or an upset stomach, bloating and gas.\n\nNHS medical director Prof Sir Stephen Powis said: \"Pharmaceutical treatments offer a new way of helping people with obesity gain a healthier weight and this new pilot will help determine if these medicines can be used safely and effectively in non-hospital settings as well as a range of other interventions we have in place.\"\n\nHe said NHS England was negotiating with the manufacturer to secure long-term supplies at prices representing value for money for taxpayers.", "Pupils were allowed to leave the school after being locked down for the morning\n\nA teenage boy is being questioned on suspicion of the attempted murder of a teacher who was stabbed at a school.\n\nThe male teacher was taken to hospital with a single wound after being attacked at Tewkesbury Academy in Gloucestershire just after 09:00 BST.\n\nFirearms officers arrested the suspect two hours later in Stoke Orchard, about three miles (4.8km) away, and a knife was seized.\n\nThe injured teacher was discharged from hospital on Monday evening.\n\nTewkesbury Academy has said it would reopen on Tuesday.\n\nGloucestershire police received a call from the ambulance service on Monday morning saying a teacher had been injured in a corridor at the school.\n\nOfficers said a \"thorough\" search was conducted after initial reports suggested the boy was still on the school's property.\n\n\"It was initially thought that the suspect had fled the scene and hidden himself within the school grounds,\" said Assistant Chief Constable Richard Ocone, of Gloucestershire Police.\n\n\"This search was both complex and meticulous in nature as we sought to ensure there were no further injured parties as well as seeking the arrest of the suspect,\" he added.\n\nTwo other schools also went into lockdown following the stabbing and further searches were conducted to make sure no-one else was hurt.\n\n\"Specialist resources including the National Police Air Service and plain-clothed officers were deployed to search the wider area,\" said ACC Ocone.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

bringing up mixed emotions about what happened back in 1992 and since.\n\n\"I feel sadness, disgust, anger, betrayal by people I expected to tell the truth (especially the original investigating officers).\"\n\nFollowing Boyd's conviction, the force apologised to Mr Heron and to Ms Henderson, although she rejected their words as \"hollow\".\n\nShe has called for a public inquiry into the force's \"historic failures\" in her daughter's case, and has been backed by the legal charity Centre for Women's Justice.\n\nNikki's family lived in the same block of tenement flats as Boyd which was just a few hundred yards from the murder scene\n\nProsecutor Richard Wright KC said the 1992 investigation was \"utterly misconceived\" and made multiple errors, but the team who re-opened \"the troubled and challenging\" case started from scratch with \"no assumptions\".\n\nPolice collected DNA samples from more than 800 men from around the country, took 1,200 statements and produced 2,500 documents.\n\nThe judge commended the \"Herculean\" effort and said the DNA evidence gathered had been \"critical\" in convicting Boyd.\n\nDavid Boyd admitted to having sexual fantasies about young girls\n\nThe court had heard Boyd was a neighbour of Nikki's in the Wear Garth flats, he knew how to navigate the Old Exchange building and had sexual fantasies about young girls.\n\nHe also had 22 convictions for 45 offences including sexual crimes.\n\nIn 1986, he exposed himself to a woman. He later told a psychiatrist he had been doing it since the age of 16 and \"couldn't control\" the urge.\n\nThat same year he was convicted of breaching the peace in Sacriston, County Durham, when he grabbed a 10-year-old girl in a park and tried to kiss her.\n\nIn 1997, he admitted to police he exposed himself to three teenage girls but was not charged.\n\nTwo years later he groped a nine-year-old girl in a park in Stockton and confessed to a probation officer that he had \"dirty thoughts\" and \"sexual fantasies\" about young girls.\n\nBoyd, seen here at about the time of Nikki's murder, has a history of sexually motivated crimes\n\nIn mitigation, Jason Pitter KC, for the defence, said Boyd had a history of mental illness, learning difficulties and an IQ level \"in the bottom 2% of the population\".\n\nHowever, the judge dismissed that as irrelevant because he used \"sufficient guile\" to lure Nikki away from her home and was quick to cover his tracks by conjuring a false alibi.\n\nShe said there was no guarantee Boyd would be released from prison and it would be up to the parole board to decide.\n\nFollow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

The government has said that junior doctors' pay demands are \"unreasonable\" and that talks can only happen if the BMA union moves \"significantly\" away from their current position.\n\nSpeaking on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) spring meetings in Washington DC, Mr Hunt said agreeing pay awards without making inflation worse was an \"incredibly difficult balancing act that we have to get right\".\n\nInflation, which is the rate prices rise at, is currently near a 40-year high in the UK. Prices in February were 10.4% higher than they were in the same month a year earlier.\n\nThat has prompted workers in many sectors to call for higher wages, bringing a wave of strikes. Official figures revealed industrial action held back economic growth in February.\n\nBut Mr Hunt told the BBC the government's aim was to \"put this high inflation period behind us\".\n\nHe said if the government stuck to its plans inflation could be brought below 3% by the end of the year.\n\n\"The worst possible thing that we can do for junior doctors, nurses, train drivers, teachers is to manage the economy in a way that they are still worried about 10% cost of living increases, in a year's time,\" he added.\n\nThough the government has pledged to cut inflation, many economists have said that inflation is due to fall naturally in the coming months, as a result of energy prices falling.When asked about the junior doctors' pay demands, the chancellor pointed out that when nurses, who started out asking for a 19% rise, publicly committed to a much lower number \"that became the basis of a fruitful discussion\".\n\nFollowing an IMF forecast suggesting that the UK would be one of the worst performing major economies in the world this year, Mr Hunt hit back, saying that the IMF had \"undershot on the British economy for quite a long time\".\n\nThe IMF now believed the British economy was \"on the right track\", he added, and had praised his recent Budget.\n\nOther G7 finance ministers at the Washington gathering warmly welcomed what they saw as a remarkable change in tone and engagement from the UK, from the last set of IMF meetings, which occurred in the middle of the mini-Budget crisis, under the previous chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng.", "Hail storms, heavy rain and flash flooding have battered towns across Spain, days after a heatwave.\n\nVideo recorded in the north of Spain shows icy water running through the streets, past chairs outside a cafe. The south east also saw heavy rain and strong winds.", "A truck carrying 102,000 live salmon in the US state of Oregon crashed last week on a creek bed, inadvertently releasing thousands of the juvenile fish into the water.\n\nThe young Chinook, also known as King, salmon were being taken from the Lookingglass Hatchery in the state's north, to the Imnaha River, where they are listed as threatened.\n\nBut the crash caused some 77,000 fish to splash into the Lookingglass Creek, boosting the population of that waterway instead.\n\nWildlife officials said on Tuesday that the driver lost control around a tight turn, causing the fish tanker to roll down a rocky embankment. The driver sustained minor injuries, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) said in a statement.\n\nThe crash happened on a tight corner on 29 March, the statement says, with the 53-ft (16m) truck \"rolling onto the passenger side, skidding on its side on the pavement, and then going over a rocky embankment causing it to roll onto its roof\".\n\nWhile thousands of fish made it into the water, many more were left stranded on the bank\n\nOver 25,000 of the salmon smolts - fish that are around two years old - died either inside the truck's tanker or on the creek bank.\n\nThe local sheriff's office responded to the crash, officials said. \"Small amounts of diesel fuel were quickly contained,\" the release said, adding that there was no need for a hazardous material spill response.\n\nThe Nez Perce Tribe and the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation also responded and helped by collecting and scanning transponders on the dead fish.\n\nSalmon are anadromous, meaning they spend much of their lives in the ocean but return to freshwater rivers to spawn. Many are now raised in government-run hatcheries before being released back into their native waters to later return to those same hatcheries.\n\nODFW officials say the loss represents about 20% of the fish it intended to release into the Imnaha River this year.\n\nThey expect that around 500-900 fewer adult fish will return to spawn in 2026-2027 due to the loss.\n\nThe 77,000 smolts in the Lookingglass Creek will likely lead to around 350-700 additional adults returning there.\n\n\"We are thankful the ODFW employee driving the truck was not seriously injured,\" said ODFW fish hatchery coordinator Andrew Gibbs.\n\n\"This should not impact our ability to collect future brood stock or maintain full production goals in the future.\"", "The mausoleum features a mosaic surrounded by a raised platform, which archaeologists believe was for burials\n\nA \"completely unique\" Roman mausoleum has been discovered by archaeologists in south London.\n\nThe remains of the structure at the Liberty of Southwark site in Borough have been described as \"extremely rare\" and feature preserved floors and walls.\n\nArchaeologists think the site was used as some form of burial ground or tomb for wealthier members of Roman society.\n\nWork on creating a permanent display is planned, says the team behind the find.\n\nThe discovery was made at the Liberty of Southwark excavation site\n\nThe dig was led by the Museum of London Archaeology (MOLA) on behalf of Landsec and Transport for London (TfL).\n\nMOLA believes the quality of preservation makes it the most intact Roman mausoleum ever to be discovered in Britain.\n\nAlongside the central mosaic, raised platforms were found and steps on the lowest side were still intact.\n\nExcavators were surprised to find two layers to the site, with another similarly designed mosaic found beneath the first floor. They believe that the building was modified at some point, with the floor raised.\n\n\"All signs indicate this was a substantial building,\" says MOLA, \"perhaps two storeys high.\"\n\nA second mosaic was found beneath the first, suggesting the floor was raised at some point\n\nWhile the site is believed to be a burial location, no coffins were found. However, more than 100 coins, fragments of pottery, roofing tiles and pieces of metal were discovered.\n\nThere has been a sustained period of excavation at the site, where the largest Roman mosaic found in London for over 50 years was uncovered in 2022.\n\nAntonietta Lerz, senior archaeologist at MOLA, says the site is a \"microcosm for the changing fortunes of Roman London\" and provides \"a fascinating window\" into the life of its settlers.\n\nThe aim is to preserve the area alongside continued urban development\n\nArchaeologists from MOLA hope to pinpoint the age of the mausoleum and have provided a three-dimensional model of the site.\n\nLandsec and TfL say they are committed to restoring and retaining the mausoleum for permanent public display.\n\nFollow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Most musicians who enter the Rock Hall attend and perform at the ceremony, although some have declined.\n\nBush's Hall of Fame nomination prompted some controversy, after one of the voters admitted they were not acquainted with her songs. Bush's career in the US was never as mainstream as the UK.\n\nSpeaking anonymously to Vulture about the 2023 nominees, the voter said: \"I've got to admit that I'm not too familiar with her music, so I don't know if I would vote for her. I want to make sure I know the catalogue.\"\n\nTheir comment sparked an angry response from fellow singer Courtney Love, who tweeted: \"Bro! The rest of us have been LIVING KATE BUSH since 1977!\"\n\n\"Too much power in the hands of IDIOTS,\" she added.\n\nCourtney Love was incensed that Kate Bush had not been inducted to the Hall of Fame on her previous three attempts\n\nIn a later column for the Guardian, Love argued that the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which was established in 1983, was guilty of marginalising female artists.\n\nThe musician noted that only nine of the 31 people on the nominations committee are women, and claimed that 90% of the voters are male.\n\nOf the 13 artists being inducted this year, four are women - with soul legend Chaka Khan receiving the musical excellence award, which recognises artists \"whose originality and influence creating music have had a dramatic impact on music\".\n\nNominees who didn't make the cut this year included Cyndi Lauper, the White Stripes, Joy Division/New Order and A Tribe Called Quest.\n\nGeorge Michael won a fan vote, which was counted alongside official ballots in deciding this year's inductees. The former Wham! frontman picked up 1.04 million votes, putting him just ahead of Lauper, who received 928,000 votes and Warren Zevon, on 634,000.\n\nMichael's induction comes on the 40th anniversary of Wham's debut album, Fantastic.

It appears to be the first evacuation of non-diplomat Americans from Sudan.\n\nBritish nationals and the NHS doctors hoping to leave Sudan had until midday local time (11:00 BST) to reach the Wadi Saeedna airfield.\n\nThey were instructed to make their own way to the airfield.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence has told the BBC flights will continue to leave Sudan until all those people who registered at the airfield before the deadline have been evacuated.\n\nMore than 1,650 people have been evacuated from Khartoum and more than 1,000 have been flown to the UK, it added.\n\nThe Foreign Office has also announced consular support in the coastal city of Port Sudan, with an office established at the Coral Hotel.\n\nIt advised British nationals to visit the team for help or call the 24-hour helpline on +441908 516 666.\n\nThe Foreign Office said the last flights marked \"the end of a successful evacuation operation\" and it was winding up evacuations due to \"declining demand for seats\".\n\nIt added that the UK has \"set up a limited consular presence at Port Sudan to signpost British nationals to available options for departure\".\n\nStories emerged this week of National Health Service doctors being turned away from the airport in Khartoum - and the Foreign Office repeatedly told the BBC that only British passport holders and their dependents were able to get on the flights.\n\nThey insisted anyone with a work permit was welcome in the UK, but must make their own way there.\n\nOn Friday evening, a message was circulated by the Department of Health and Social Care to NHS doctors in Sudan, telling them to make their way to Wadi Saeedna airfield, just north of the capital, for evacuation.\n\nThe text, seen by the BBC, tells any medical staff with leave to remain to bring dependents and proof of NHS employment.\n\nThe change comes after the case of Sudanese doctor Dr Abdulrahman Babiker, who was initially refused a place on a British evacuation, made headlines.\n\nDr Babiker landed back in the UK on Saturday after he was successfully evacuated on a flight to Cyprus which landed there on Friday evening.\n\nHe told the BBC he was \"really glad\" that the UK government had changed its guidance - but said there was \"just one day only\" for his colleagues in Sudan to make the last flights.\n\nAfter he landed in Cyprus, he said he had \"mixed feelings\", saying: \"I am happy that I am finally in a safe place, away from a war and on my way back to the UK.

The parents of missing Jack O'Sullivan say it's \"hell on earth\" without him\n\nThe parents of missing student Jack O'Sullivan say they are living in \"hell on earth\" without him.\n\nCatherine and Alan O'Sullivan's 23-year-old son has not been seen or heard from by his family since he went to a house party in Bristol on 2 March.\n\nMrs O'Sullivan said: \"I want the world to try and give me an answer to where Jack is. It's horrific.\"\n\nThe family is urging anyone in the Hotwells area on that date to come forward with information.\n\nMr O'Sullivan was last seen at 03:15 GMT in the area of Brunel Lock Road and Brunel Way in Bristol on 2 March and his family have been searching each day since then.\n\nJack O'Sullivan was last seen on CCTV in the Cumberland Basin area of Bristol\n\nMrs O'Sullivan said it was very out of character for Jack to go missing suddenly and that his 23rd birthday on 28 March was \"horrific\" without him.\n\n\"Jack's birthday was hell on earth and this last few days it's getting harder because the answers are just not coming,\" she said.\n\nShe said when she realised Jack had not come home after the house party, she knew \"instantly\" something had happened.\n\n\"Jack had been out, he had messaged me, everything seemed fine we weren't expecting him to be that late but when we awoke at 5.25am I instantly knew there was a problem because it was so unlike Jack.\n\n\"We could only go by phone messages that we were getting on my phone from a family group chat and it was giving me a location in Hotwells as to where Jack was.\n\n\"So we go there and really nothing came to light, and here we are nearly 30 days after that moment with no further information or sighting.\"\n\nAlan and Catherine O'Sullivan have retraced their son's last known steps at different times of the day to try to work out what might have happened\n\nShe said they were \"at a loss\" as to what could have happened to him for three and a half hours between when he left the party and his last phone signal.\n\n\"There is not a lot of sense to it,\" she said.\n\nThe family has been out many times in the night searching for him and retracing his last known steps.\n\n\"It just doesn't add up. We were very shocked to see how well lit the area was in the middle of the night.\n\n\"I was expecting it to be really dark and then to think well someone could trip but it's lit up like in the middle of the day,\" Mrs O'Sullivan said.\n\nDet Insp Jason Chidgey said Avon and Somerset Police is still trying to establish Jack's movements following the last sighting of him on CCTV.\n\nSpecialist officers have carried out \"a significant number of searches\" in the area with support from the dive team, drones and dogs.\n\n\"Public awareness is key to this case,\" Det Insp Chidgey said.\n\n\"We're trying to establish what happened and exactly where Jack might be to try and answer some of those questions that the family have.\n\n\"They're going through a very difficult time and they're suffering quite a lot.\"\n\nJack O'Sullivan was last seen on 2 March leaving a house party in Bristol\n\nPolice have appealed for anyone who was driving in the Cumberland Basin area, or who may have dashcam footage, to make contact.\n\nJack O'Sullivan is described as white, about 5ft 10ins (1.7m), of slim build, with short brown hair.\n\nHe was wearing a quilted green/brown Barbour jacket over a beige woollen jumper, with navy chinos and brown leather trainers with white soles.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "The chancellor has praised a Tory MP for apologising after he admitted he gave other MPs' personal phone numbers to someone on a dating app.\n\nJeremy Hunt said William Wragg had been \"courageous\" in telling the Times he was sorry for the \"hurt\" he had caused.\n\nMr Wragg told the newspaper he had been \"scared\" because the individual had \"compromising things on me\".\n\nIt follows reports at least 12 men in political circles received unsolicited messages, raising security concerns.\n\nThe men are reported to include a government minister, advisers and political journalists based at Westminster.\n\nSome had been sent naked images, and two MPs are reported to have responded by sending images of themselves.\n\nMr Wragg has not been suspended as a Conservative MP and the party's whips office - in charge of party discipline - is not commenting, citing an ongoing police investigation.\n\nHowever, some MPs have privately expressed surprise that Mr Wragg has not lost the Conservative whip. At least one Tory MP has contacted the whips' office to say he should be suspended from the parliamentary party.\n\nThe BBC has attempted to contact Mr Wragg, who is standing down as an MP at the general election, for comment.\n\nA Leicestershire Police spokesperson said the force was \"investigating a report of malicious communications\" that had been made to them last month.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police said it was in contact with Leicestershire Police and Parliament's security team, adding: \"We will assess any reports made to us accordingly.\"\n\nOne former MP, who is gay, has told the BBC he was targeted by someone calling themselves \"Charlie\", who claimed - wrongly - that he had previously worked for Mr Wragg.\n\n\"The last part of that message was 'Westminster misses you\u2026' and that was basically something that friends usually do say anyway to make me feel better,\" he added.\n\n\"I was starting to feel bad actually. I was embarrassed thinking I'm speaking to someone who knows who I am and I'm trying desperately not to come across as rude.\"\n\nThe next message said: \"I've just become single so I'm hanging out with the Westminster gays.\"\n\nThe former MP explained he was in a relationship, but further flirtatious messages followed. After \"Charlie\" sent an explicit image, the former MP blocked him.\n\nBBC News has also seen similar messages sent from the same number to a political journalist.\n\nThe BBC has also spoken to a man who works for an MP, who was messaged \"out of the blue\" last autumn by someone calling themselves \"Abi\" with a female profile picture.\n\nThe staffer said they claimed to know him from work, and mentioned an event he had attended.\n\nBut he grew suspicious when he asked who they were, and they replied with information that was \"clearly wrong\".\n\nHe said he ignored them, but they continued to message him. He told the BBC he learned five or six months later that someone else had received messages from a person with the same number and similar picture.\n\nThe MP's staff member said he would be \"very surprised\" if Mr Wragg had his number, and he cannot recall ever having met him.\n\nShadow chancellor Rachel Reeves says Mr Wragg's future is a 'question for the Conservatives'\n\nSpeaking to reporters earlier, Mr Hunt said the reports of unsolicited messages were a \"great cause for concern\" but Mr Wragg had \"given a courageous and fulsome apology\".\n\nHe added that the reports should be a \"lesson\" to both MPs and members of the public that they need to be careful about cyber-security.\n\nIt is unclear who is behind the unsolicited messages. Some MPs have expressed concerns that a foreign power, such as China and Russia, could be involved.\n\nCommons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has written to MPs telling them it would be \"unwise\" to speculate, and promising to keep them \"updated on developments\".\n\nMr Wragg, who is vice chair of the influential 1922 committee of backbench Tory MPs, told the Times said he had sent intimate pictures of himself to a man he met on gay dating app Grindr.\n\n\"They had compromising things on me. They wouldn't leave me alone,\" added the 36-year-old, who has been MP for Hazel Grove in Greater Manchester since 2015.\n\n\"They would ask for people. I gave them some numbers, not all of them. I told him to stop. He's manipulated me and now I've hurt other people.\n\n\"I got chatting to a guy on an app and we exchanged pictures. We were meant to meet up for drinks, but then didn't. Then he started asking for numbers of people. I was worried because he had stuff on me. He gave me a WhatsApp number, which doesn't work now.\n\n\"I've hurt people by being weak. I was scared. I'm mortified. I'm so sorry that my weakness has caused other people hurt.\"\n\nConservative MP Sir Charles Walker said it would be \"madness\" for Mr Wragg, a friend of his, to quit as an MP.\n\nHe told BBC Radio 4's PM programme Mr Wragg had \"been subject to a sting operation by a very clever and manipulative operator\".\n\nHe added: \"I think a lot of people may think that what Will did was misguided, and even stupid, but I also believe that there's a lot of compassion out there.\n\n\"I'm not excusing what Will has done, but I do think that he is a victim in this along with all the others.\"\n\nLabour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the incident was \"incredibly concerning,\" and the police investigation \"should be able to take its course\".\n\nShe declined to offer a view on whether Mr Wragg, who also chairs the Commons constitutional affairs committee, should resign, adding it was a \"question for the Conservatives\".\n\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey would not be drawn on whether Mr Wragg should be suspended, adding it was a question for the Tories.\n\nHe added that he did not believe any of his party's MPs had been involved in the apparent phishing incidents.\n\nA House of Commons spokesperson said it took security \"extremely seriously\" and provided MPs and staff with \"tailored advice\" to make them aware of risks online.\n\n\"We are encouraging anyone affected who has concerns to contact the Parliamentary Security Department,\" they added.", "This content is currently not available\n\n...but we'll be back tomorrow, and we'll have a wealth of music legends to get our ears around.\n\nSir Elton John will be headlining the Pyramid Stage on Sunday night and has promised to create a \"brand new show\" for Glastonbury.\n\nHis set will wrap up his touring commitments in the UK, and Sir Elton has told Radio 1's Clara Amfo it \"couldn't be a more perfect ending\".\n\nElsewhere, in the coveted Sunday afternoon Legend slot Yusuf, also known as Cat Stevens, will take to the stage.\n\nGlasto festival-goers will also be treated to Lil Nas X, Blondie, Queens of the Stone Age, Rudimental, Phoenix, Alt-J, and many, many more.\n\nToday's coverage was brought to you by myself, Christy Cooney, Imogen James and Jasmine Taylor-Coleman in London, as well as our reporters in Glastonbury.\n\nGoodnight and see you tomorrow!", "A 15-year-old girl has died after being pulled from the sea at Cleethorpes beach, police have confirmed.\n\nHumberside Police said the girl and a boy, also 15, were airlifted to hospital at about 19:30 BST on Saturday.\n\nThe boy received treatment but was later discharged, the force said.\n\nBoth children had been reported missing at about 14:00 BST, prompting a search that involved an HM Coastguard helicopter and RNLI lifeboat.\n\nFlowers have been left at the scene of Saturday's tragedy\n\nFlowers and tributes to the girl have been left at the scene.\n\nPolice said the girl would not be officially named, at the request of her family.\n\nDet Insp Nathan Reuben said: \"Our thoughts and sincere condolences are with the family at this incredibly difficult time.

The England goalkeeper then made two excellent saves - to block Jacob Murphy's volley and then acrobatically tip over a powerful effort from Isak.\n\nBoth sides had chances in an open second half, with substitute James Garner hitting the post for Everton within six minutes of his introduction.\n\nNewcastle thought they had got a second goal when a quickly taken free-kick released Isak and he crossed for Burn to convert, only for the goal to be ruled out after a VAR review with Isak narrowly offside.\n\nA failure to kill off the game proved costly as Dummett's needless foul gave Everton and Calvert-Lewin the chance to snatch a draw, which they duly took.\n\nSince the Toffees beat Burnley just before Christmas, Sean Dyche's side have lost in the league against Tottenham, Manchester City (twice), Wolves, West Ham, Manchester United and Bournemouth and drawn with Aston Villa, Fulham, Tottenham, Crystal Palace, Brighton and now Newcastle.\n\nEverton have only had one longer top-flight winless run - 14 games from March to September in 1937 - and will be looking to avoid an unwanted piece of history when they entertain Burnley on Saturday.\n\u2022 None Attempt missed.

It cannot justify the defendant's offending in any way.\"\n\nBorrington told the trial she had never harmed Harvey, maintaining he had fallen off a sofa and banged his head.\n\nHowever, an expert witness called by the prosecution said she believed Harvey had died as a result of \"direct blunt force trauma\", sustained after Borrington assaulted the youngster.\n\nSentencing Borrington, Mr Justice Nicklin told her: \"Precisely what happened to Harvey only you know, but by their verdict the jury were sure that your account of Harvey having fallen, hitting his head on the floor, was not the truth or at least not the full truth.\n\n\"The jury's verdict shows they were sure you had assaulted Harvey, causing the very serious head injuries that led to his death.\"\n\nBorrington was also convicted of inflicting grievous bodily harm for previously breaking Harvey's arm, and assault occasioning actual bodily harm for an incident in which she squeezed his cheeks.\n\nShe was given a two-year prison sentence and a six-month term for these offences, to be served concurrently with her manslaughter sentence.\n\nThe judge also said she would serve two-thirds of the 15-year sentence in prison before being released on licence.\n\nHarvey's mother described him as \"my world\" and a \"treasured grandson\" to her parents.\n\n\"To have it confirmed that Harvey before his death had been assaulted by Leila Borrington will be a life-long trauma for me, a recurring nightmare which I will never be able to wake from,\" she told the court.\n\nShe cried as she explained that her son's disability meant he could not tell her about the abuse being inflicted by his stepmother.\n\n\"He couldn't tell me he didn't want to go [to stay with Borrington],\" she said.\n\nAn NSPCC spokesperson said the case \"highlighted the vulnerability of young children and those with disabilities, who are entirely dependent on those who care for them and are at increased risk of abuse\".\n\nDona Parry-Jones, a senior crown prosecutor at CPS East Midlands, said Harvey had \"died at the hands of someone who should have been there to care for him and nurture him\".\n\nDet Insp Simon Harrison, of Nottinghamshire Police, said the case had been \"disturbing and upsetting\" to work on.\n\n\"The death of any child is a tragedy, but there is something especially awful about cases of this nature,\" he said.\n\n\"As a police officer I am pleased that justice has now been done, but I am aware that no custodial sentence can adequately reflect the pain and anguish felt by Harvey's family.\n\n\"My thoughts, and the thoughts of my colleagues, remain with them today.\"\n\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

Now there are four, some of them falling on the day of major sport and music events.\n\nAny hopes the RMT's dispute with 14 train companies was close to being solved, have now been dashed. It's very much not over - unlike the dispute with Network Rail, which saw signallers and maintenance staff accept a deal in March.\n\nThe dispute with the train operators always looked harder to resolve than Network Rail, because of the changes to working conditions involved - the strings attached, from the unions' perspective.\n\nThere's more misery for passengers on the way - hitting confidence in railway travel again - and workers will lose more pay.\n\nTrain companies' separate dispute with the train drivers' union Aslef has never looked close to a resolution, and today it announced three more strike dates.\n\nBut today's announcement from the RMT was a surprise, and makes it hard to see how their dispute goes from here.\n\nThe RMT's strikes have less impact than they did when Network Rail was involved too. But right now, it looks like there's still plenty of disruption ahead.\n\nThe government has a significant role - it holds the purse strings. It has shown no sign recently of being prepared to allow the train companies to put more money on the table.\n\nThe last rail strike on 18 March meant only 40% to 50% of trains could run as workers across 14 train operators walked out.\n\nThe ongoing dispute has affected services since June last year.\n\nHow are you affected by the latest round of rail strikes?

It is independent of the university and the student union.\n\nIt said the move is a \"a profound failure to live up to\" ideals of \"free inquiry and the disinterested pursuit of the truth by means of reasoned argument\".\n\nIn its response, the Oxford University Student Union said national press coverage \"erroneously\" conflated the opposition to Prof Stock and the decision to split with the Oxford Union.\n\nIt said the debate prior to the decision made no mention of Prof Stock or any other speaker, and was due to \"long-standing concerns\" about \"alleged bullying, sexual harassment, discrimination, and data privacy breaches\".\n\nIt added: \"[The student's union] will defend the right of people to freedom of expression, and will defend the right of people to have controversial and unpopular ideas debated as part of an integral part of university life\".\n\nThere has been ongoing tension in UK universities over freedom of speech on the issue of transgender rights.\n\nLast month, a second attempted screening of a controversial film about gender-critical issues was cancelled due to protest at the University of Edinburgh.\n\nThe Oxford Union is celebrating its bicentennial year in 2023, and has a history of welcoming some of the world's most high-profile figures.\n\nIts debating chamber has previously heard from a host of American presidents, and figures like Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking.\n\nIt has also drawn controversy, having extended invites to the likes of far-right activist Tommy Robinson and French far-right former politician Marion Marechal-Le Pen.\n\nTheir appearances were marked by protests.\n\nUpdate 5 June: This article originally described the free speech letter as having been signed by 44 academics, and this was amended with a note of correction on 27 May to say it was signed by academics and staff.

It said this was \"slightly higher than last winter\" and \"broadly in line with those of recent winters\".\n\nHowever, its \"base case\" scenario assumes normal energy market conditions with no disruptions to supplies.\n\nNational Grid said it was taking steps to \"minimise the potential impact to electricity customers\" in Britain if supplies were disrupted again.\n\nAlongside maintaining its energy-saving scheme for households to get discounts on bills, it said it was holding discussions about having two coal power stations on standby. The amount available to the grid if required has fallen from five in 2022 to two, with two now closed down and one other unable to be called upon.\n\nThe UK is heavily reliant on gas to produce electricity, with gas-fired power stations generating more than 40% of the country's electricity.

The impact of the 7.4 magnitude earthquake in Taiwan\n\nRescuers in Taiwan are working to reach more than 600 stranded people, a day after the island experienced its worst earthquake in 25 years.\n\nOne survivor has recounted how tremors unleashed rockslides \"like bullets\" around the coal mine he was working at.\n\nThe 7.4 magnitude earthquake hit near the eastern county of Hualien, killing nine and injuring more than 1,000.\n\nSome stuck in tunnels and near a national park have been rescued by helicopters, but 34 are still missing.\n\nThe official number of people trapped or stranded rose considerably - from about 100 to 660 - on Thursday as people started getting phone signal back in the mountainous regions.\n\nAlmost all are guests and staff of a remote hotel who cannot leave because of damaged roads. Officials are now trying to work out the best way to get them out.\n\nFood supplies have been air-dropped to dozens trapped in these areas, local reports say.\n\n\"The mountain started raining rocks like bullets, we had nowhere to escape to, everyone ran beside the sandbags for cover,\" the survivor, identified by his surname Chu, told Taiwan's Central News Agency.\n\nThree of the nine who died were hikers on a trail leading towards Taroko National Park, named after a landmark gorge, just outside Hualien.\n\nIn Hualien city, the capital of the county where the earthquake struck, relief efforts are proceeding quickly, with workers using excavators and other heavy equipment to demolish several damaged buildings.\n\nOn Thursday morning, the BBC also witnessed relief workers removing huge boulders - the size of cars - that had fallen close to railway lines so as to get normal train services running again.\n\nThey are also using large amounts of gravel and rocks to shore up a 10-storey structure known as the Uranus building, which has been leaning downwards since the quake struck - to prevent it from falling over in case of another aftershock.\n\nLocal reports said one female teacher had died in the building when she returned to rescue her cat.\n\nThe red brick Uranus building is seen leaning precariously\n\nHsu Chiu-yueh, who was working opposite the Uranus building when it collapsed, told the BBC: \"It was so shaky I could barely walk. I was really scared. I felt my legs were not in control anymore. Thanks to my colleagues, they dragged me so we could get out.\"\n\n\"There was a lot of dust coming into our building on our way out... We [later] realised that it came from the building across the street that had partially collapsed,\" said the 50-year-old.\n\nAnother Hualien resident recounted how the quake threw her home into disarray.\n\n\"I was just getting out of bed when a clothes rack and a low cabinet fell over,\" Ocean Tsai told BBC Chinese.\n\n\"It kept getting stronger, and I started worrying about our belongings at home. Fortunately, apart from the motorcycle tipping over, the damage was minimal.\"\n\nThe earthquake, which struck 18km (11mi) south of Hualien, was followed by more than 200 aftershocks, dozens of which were at least 6.5 magnitude or more, hindering search and rescue efforts. Taiwanese authorities expect there to be more aftershocks in the next few days.\n\nPictures show how the road outside Hualien's Qingshui tunnel - one of many winding roads that run along Hualien's rocky coastline - had simply fallen away.\n\nRoutes like Qingshui are popular among tourists because of their spectacular views from the mountains out across the Pacific Ocean. But they are also known to be treacherous, not least because of the possibility of landslides.\n\nFurther north, the capital Taipei was also shaken violently with footage showing damaged buildings and people being evacuated. Local TV stations aired clips of smashed vehicles and stores in disarray.\n\n\"The earthquake is close to land and it's shallow. It's felt all over Taiwan and offshore islands... It's the strongest in 25 years,\" Wu Chien Fu, the director of Taipei's Seismology Centre said on Wednesday.\n\nPower cuts and internet outages were reported across the island.\n\nThe earthquake also triggered tsunami alerts earlier in the day on Wednesday in nearby Japanese and Philippine islands, but these alerts were later downgraded.\n\nWhile Taiwan has a history of quakes, both locals and foreigners who have lived in Taipei for years say this is the strongest quake they have experienced in decades.\n\nThe last major quake at 7.6 magnitude hit in September 1999, killing 2,400 people and destroying 5,000 buildings.\n\nAdditional reporting by Fan Wang in Singapore and BBC Chinese's Tzu-Wei Liu in Taipei", "Shifting debris could become dangerous for salvage crews above and below the water's surface.\n\nUS Army Colonel Estee Pinchasin looks out at the thousands of tonnes of twisted, broken steel and concrete jutting out from the dark waters of Maryland's Patapsco river, and delivers her assessment: an \"unforgiving mangled mess\".\n\n\"That's the best way to describe this,\" the fatigue-clad veteran says from the deck of an Army-operated salvage vessel, the Reynolds. \"It's hard to explain steel that is cantilevered, bent and smashed with so much force.\"\n\nThe \"mess\" Col Pinchasin has been tasked with clearing is the tattered remnants of Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge, strewn around - and embedded into - the Dali, a massive 948ft (289m) cargo ship that now sits motionless under an expanse of shredded metal, with partially crushed shipping containers hanging from its sides.\n\nThe mangled mess is self-explanatory. But why unforgiving? Because, put simply, anything and everything here is a potential threat to the lives of salvage crews.\n\nThe Dali's collision with the bridge in the early hours of 26 March brought the structure down in a matter of seconds, leaving six workers dead and the ship stuck. This has prompted a huge response that has included the US Army Corps of Engineers, Navy, Coast Guard, Maryland authorities and specialist private firms.\n\nThe effort aims to unblock the 700ft (213m) wide and 50ft (15m) deep shipping channel, re-float and remove the Dali and clear whatever remains of the estimated 3,000 to 4,000 tonnes of debris from the wider Patapsco.\n\n\"Those things are happening simultaneously,\" Col Pinchasin, the Army Corps of Engineers Baltimore district commander, told the BBC. \"But the priority is for the channel, because we need to get those people back to work and help all the businesses that are affected.\"\n\nThe port is one of the busiest on the East Coast of the United States and a key regional hub for goods including steel, aluminium and agricultural equipment. It is used by car-makers including General Motors and Honda. As many as 15,000 jobs depend on it, including 8,000 directly employed there.\n\nSonar images taken by the US Navy show vast quantities of debris sitting underwater (highlighted in yellow)\n\nThe mission has turned the area into a hub of activity, buzzing with small US Navy sonar vessels and police boats, workers testing spark-emitting hydraulic shears, and - so far - seven huge crane barges, including the Chesapeake, a 1,000-tonne capacity crane once used by the CIA to build a ship used to recover a Soviet submarine from the bottom of the Pacific.\n\nPiece by piece, debris will eventually be disassembled and lifted onto barges to be taken away.\n\n\"With every layer of debris they remove, they have to go back in and survey the wreckage to see if it reacted the way we thought it was going to,\" Col Pinchasin said. \"Are there any instabilities? Are they things we missed? What did we not see?\"\n\n\"They need to have discipline and be very self-critical.\"\n\nThe dangerous work of making these determinations has so far fallen on teams of divers who inspect both the ship and the vast, unseen debris field beneath the surface.\n\nThey are often unable to see more than a foot or two in the muddy brown waters of the Patapsco, forcing them to be guided by operators in nearby surface vessels.\n\nTheir assessments, Col Pinchasin said, are essential to ensuring that larger pieces of debris can be dismantled and removed safely.\n\n\"The pieces might be mangled, but there's a lot of force pent-up in how they're sitting right now,\" she said, gesturing at a large chunk of metal protruding from the shipping channel.\n\n\"If you were to cut one of those things, and there's tension there you don't know about and it snaps, people can be in a lot of danger,\" she added. \"We need to know what's connected, and that's why the divers have to go in. They have to feel and reach to verify\u2026 but it's like they have their eyes closed.\"\n\nA separate team of divers, drawn from the ranks of the Maryland State Police, stands ready to dive if and when investigators believe they have found the remains of the three men still missing from the collapse.\n\nThe continued search for those men, she added, continues to weigh heavily on the minds of those involved in the salvage operation.\n\n\"These are families that did not get to celebrate Easter together,\" she said. \"This is very solemn ground.\"\n\nThose involved in the operation and maritime experts say that the scope of the operation has few, if any comparisons.\n\nAn initial $60m (\u00a347.4m) in emergency funds have been earmarked to cover the work. The true cost may be much higher, with one politician, Maryland Democrat David Trone, telling CBS that the cost could eventually rise to $1bn.\n\n\"The scale is the biggest challenge, but also the complexity,\" said Captain Dan Hoban, a British Royal Engineer who was on a routine exchange with the US Army Corps of Engineers when the bridge collapsed.\n\n\"It's a really messy situation. From an engineering perspective, we are trying to figure out where the cuts are going to be made and then incorporate that into a lifting plan,\" added Capt Hoban, who has been helping with the mission.\n\n\"But it needs to be safe for all those operating out there,\" he added. \"Everyone wants to get going quickly, but trying to do so safely and efficiently. We don't want to create a more difficult situation. That's the key.\"\n\nLarge crane barges are also serving as launch pads for extensive dive operations around the Dali\n\nPeter Ford, a long time merchant mariner whose firm SkyRock Advisors specialises in infrastructure projects, said that the \"intricacies\" of the Baltimore operation made it considerably more hazardous than other complex operations, such as that which freed the Ever Given, after it got stuck in the Suez Canal in 2021.\n\n\"This is beyond anything we've seen,\" he said. \"It's all going to be hard. It's the mixture of the infrastructure above and below water and the fact that debris is literally draped over and balancing on the vessel.\"\n\nOnce salvage crews begin cutting larger pieces of the debris, Mr Ford predicts that the constant shifting and movement of the debris and the vessel alike can become a potentially dangerous challenge.\n\n\"God forbid that somebody miscalculates and this very sharp steel ends up cutting into a part of the ship where the bunker fuel is, or some sort of hazardous commodities on the vessel are breached and leaked into the ocean,\" he said.\n\n\"This is a game of Jenga you don't want to lose.\"\n\nWorkers plan to use specialised cutting tools and hydraulic shears to remove parts of the Key Bridge\n\nFor now, the salvage operation is still in its early stages and is largely focused on assessing the scene and the bridge, removing smaller pieces and have so far opened smaller temporary shipping channels to allow limited maritime traffic to pass through the area.\n\nBy the end of April, the Army Corps of Engineers plans to open a limited access channel 280ft (80m) wide and 35ft (10m) deep to allow one-way traffic for barge containers and some roll-on-roll-off vessels that carry cars and equipment.\n\nThe entire, permanent channel is expected to be clear and ready for use by the end of May, the \"unified command\" responsible for the operation said in a statement on 4 April.\n\nThat target date, however, may change because of the weather or unforeseen problems with the clearance operations.\n\n\"We have to go slow to go fast. Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast,\" she said. \"This is a long haul.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Gaza is on the brink of famine, with Oxfam reporting that 300,000 people trapped in the north have lived since January on an average of 245 calories a day.\n\nLt Col Lerner said troops would rotate out because the military had completed its mission in Khan Younis.\n\nKhan Younis has been under Israeli bombardment for months, and the city and surrounding area are largely destroyed.\n\nLt Col Lerner said: \"The war is not over. War can only be over when they [hostages] come home and when Hamas is gone.\"\n\n\"It is a decline in the forces but there are more operations that need to be conducted. Rafah is clearly a stronghold. We need to dismantle Hamas' capabilities wherever they are.\"\n\nUS National Security spokesman John Kirby said it appeared to be a \"rest and refit\" and \"not necessarily... indicative of some coming new operation for these troops\".\n\nBut later Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said the troops were leaving to \"prepare for their follow-up missions\".\n\nHe said their achievements in Khan Younis were \"extremely impressive\", adding that Hamas had ceased to function as a military organisation throughout Gaza.\n\nIsrael has long warned of a planned ground offensive in the southern city of Rafah, where more than a million displaced Palestinians are sheltering.\n\nBut international pressure for a ceasefire is mounting, and the US - Israel's closest and most powerful ally - warned earlier this week that its ongoing support for the Gaza war is dependent on \"specific, concrete steps\" to boost aid and prevent civilian deaths.\n\nMarking six months of the war, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was \"one step away from victory\" but insisted there would be no ceasefire without the release of Israeli hostages.\n\n\"The achievements of the war are considerable: we have eliminated 19 of Hamas's 24 battalions, including senior commanders,\" he said.\n\nIsraelis have been marking six months since the 7 October attacks by Hamas\n\nTens of thousands of Israelis rallied against Mr Netanyahu on Saturday, demanding a deal to free the hostages held in Gaza.\n\nThe rallies in Tel Aviv and other cities came hours after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) recovered the body of hostage Elad Katzir.\n\nOrganisers said the protest in Tel Aviv had drawn 100,000 people, while other counts put attendance at around 45,000.\n\nMore demonstrations took place on Sunday evening, with thousands protesting in Jerusalem.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.", "Passengers flying into the UK faced hours of delays at airports across the country where passport e-gates were not working.\n\nTravellers told of their anger at being stuck in queues at airports including Heathrow, Manchester and Gatwick.\n\nThe Home Office said on Saturday evening that all e-gates were now operating as normal.\n\nThe disruption, which began on Friday night, had been due to an IT issue, a source told the BBC.\n\nAll airports across the country using the technology were affected.\n\nThe e-gate system speeds up passport control by allowing some passengers to scan their own passports. It uses facial recognition to verify identity and captures the traveller's image.\n\nPeople flying into the UK had to have their passports checked manually, with larger airports with e-gates most affected.\n\nMarc Baret had been booked on a flight from Chicago to Manchester via Heathrow, but told BBC News he had changed his plans after he was left waiting for more than two hours at the London airport.\n\nHe said: \"It was absolute chaos at passport control.

I was so uncomfortable I just couldn't concentrate,\" she said.\n\nShe and other pupils had been told tampons and pads would be available in the toilets.\n\nBut when she could not find any, Tilly spent the next two hours panicking and unable to concentrate on her exam paper, as she leaked on to her chair.\n\nAs the other pupils filed out of the exam hall, Tilly waited behind, too upset to leave, then went home early as she could not face staying at school.\n\n\"I broke down to my head of year - and he didn't give me any support,\" she says. \"He told me to be more discreet about it.\"\n\nTilly's school, in Cardiff, said it could not comment on the incident but the accessibility of products in the school had improved in the past year.\n\nNow in Year 11, Tilly runs a Love Your Period campaign with her sister Molly\n\nPeriod-product schemes are in place across the four UK nations.\n\nThe Welsh government wants to achieve \"period dignity\" by 2027, improving access to products and reducing stigma.\n\nEarlier this year, it committed to ensuring free period products were available at every school and college in the country.\n\n\"Guidance issued to schools states period products should be easily accessible in toilets, in a basket or free to use dispenser,\" an official said.\n\nThe Scottish government made history in 2018 by becoming the first in the world to make period products free to school, college and university students.\n\nIn England, the Period Products Scheme has been in place since 2020. And the government says its funding will continue until at least July 2024.\n\nBut in Northern Ireland, Department for Education funding to provide period products in schools has been cut by 40%.\n\nIn some schools and colleges, the Period Products Scheme is working well.\n\nAt Harlow College, in Essex, a tote bag filled with pads and tampons hangs on the back of unisex toilet cubicle doors.\n\nGill Atkinson, from the college's wellbeing and safeguarding team, says access to products has not only removed stigma and shame around periods, it has also helped improve attendance.\n\nThe college has spent its allocated \u00a37,000 on products this year and is hopeful funding will continue.\n\n\"I don't think the college would be able to fund it themselves,\" Gill says.\n\nAs well as providing free tampons and sanitary pads, Gill's team distributes other products, including period underwear, which she says are increasingly popular\n\nStaff at Portland College, in Mansfield, Notts, a residential college for young disabled people, say the Period Products Scheme has helped their students to feel comfortable talking about periods.\n\nSpeech-and-language therapist Amy Smith-Patrick says some pupils need support to use the period products, so it would not be appropriate to leave pads in toilets for students to help themselves to.\n\nOthers are non-verbal, so used to struggle to know how to ask for the products they needed.\n\nNow, students on their period can hand in a slip at reception or in class, in exchange for products - removing communication barriers and embarrassment.\n\nPeriod underwear has been a \"real positive\" for students with autism, Amy adds, as it can be more comfortable for those with sensory-processing difficulties.\n\nIn some situations, it can be hard to cater for everybody's needs.\n\nMinnie, 13, from Sheffield, tells BBC News she feels \"very embarrassed\" she has to go to a staff office on the top floor of school if she needs products - and it would be better to have them in cubicles.\n\nBut the head teacher at Minnie's school, who BBC News has decided not to identify, says if pupils have to ask for products, staff can discreetly keep track of which students might need additional support.\n\nMinnie says the security cameras covering the sink area in school bathrooms also make her feel uncomfortable.\n\nBut the head teacher says these are for pupils' safety.\n\nHarlow College buys in eco-friendly period products, using funds from England's scheme\n\nIrise International chief executive Emily Wilson says while England's scheme is an \"amazing\" policy commitment, \"we've got to get it working in schools, so that when a young person needs a product it's there, available, ideally in the toilets, in a shame-free way\".\n\nEmily Wilson's charity is preparing for a parade in Westminster on Sunday\n\nPHS Group supplies schools with products in England and Wales and works independently of government.\n\nInterim findings from its 2023 Period Equality White Paper suggest students are missing school or college because period products are unavailable or too expensive.\n\nOf the 546 13-18-year-olds surveyed who had missed school because of their period:\n\n\"Our initial results show progress has been made since the pandemic but the cost-of-living crisis is having an effect,\" head of commercial Clare Hughes says.\n\n\"It's clear many learners are relying on free period products they're accessing at school - and for the next year we will work with governments and local authorities to highlight these issues.\"\n\nA Department for Education official said: \"Since the launch of our free period-products scheme, in January 2020, 97% of secondary schools and 92% of post-16 organisations in England have ordered free period products for pupils - and we're encouraging more primary schools to sign up.\n\n\"School leaders and teachers know their pupils best and our guidance provides advice and support on ways to promote the scheme to pupils that avoids embarrassment or stigma.\n\n\"It also encourages schools to involve pupils in deciding which period products are ordered.\"\n\nHave you had difficulty accessing free period products in school?

She was laid off work during the pandemic and has been freelancing ever since. She brings in about \u00a32,000 per month, but her income can be irregular.\n\nShe lives with her husband - who is starting a business - and their two children. Their monthly mortgage payment is \u00a3996.00 per month. They also pay \u00a3130.00 for energy, \u00a342.00 for water, \u00a3139.00 for council tax and \u00a359.73 for a Sky subscription.\n\nJanine's job situation has meant a big change for the family. She can no longer save and has to stick to a strict budget.\n\nThe kids are on school holiday, so I need to keep them entertained.\n\nI've been taking advantage of the Easter sales to buy things we need. I picked up 10 pairs of underpants in Asda for \u00a34.80 for our youngest boy, saving \u00a31.20.\n\nWe went to Sports Direct to buy outdoors shoes for the kids for \u00a35.99.\n\nWe're eating together as a family tonight, so I bought some flowers for Mum for \u00a36.00 at Asda. She deserves a treat because she really helped us out last week when our little boy had his tonsils and adenoids out.\n\nOver the weekend, we spent money on an Easter trail, so we're trying to keep the costs down today.\n\nJanine tried to keep her kids entertained during school holidays without breaking the bank\n\nThe weather was nice, so we dashed out to the park in the morning. I use vouchers, coupons and promotions for little treats like coffee, or eating out.\n\nWe needed some food from Tesco so I tied it into the day out. I spent just under \u00a315.00 on bits for tea. I bought the kids a slice of pizza and a sausage roll for \u00a33.55 at Greggs. My coffee was free from my O2 app so that kept me going until we got home.\n\nMy \u00a313.49 gym membership went out today. A woman came round to buy a post box shape sorter I sold on Facebook for \u00a33.00.\n\nMy husband took the kids to the cinema this morning because I needed time to shoot some videos. I opened The Thrifty Family blog and Tiktok account back in October to talk about the financial challenges we face. This brings in around \u00a31,600 per month.\n\nWe had two free tickets on our Vitality Life insurance app so I paid \u00a35.99 for one ticket and we took our own snacks in. I had my MoT today and thankfully the car gods were with me. It cost \u00a354.00 and everything was ok. We bought the car on finance and we pay \u00a3205.00 per month. It won't be paid off for another couple of years.\n\nI organised a trip to Grandma's for the kids today. In the past I would have probably booked a holiday somewhere, but now we've got to stick to budgets.\n\nShe kept costs down by organising outdoor activities with her sons\n\nI managed to get my hair cut - the first time I've had chance to go since January. It cost \u00a335.00 for a cut and blow dry. I colour it myself and spend a fiver every couple of months.\n\nThis is turning out to be an expensive week. My spending today was \u00a335.00 plus \u00a33.00 tip.\n\nIt was big shop day today. The Tesco delivery arrived and it cost \u00a3139.88. We pay \u00a37.99 for a delivery saver every month which means I can track how much we spend each week and there's no temptation to load up the trolley with things we don't need. If we run out in between we go to Aldi.\n\nIt rained all day in Manchester, typical in the school holidays. I took the kids for lunch to M&S because kids eat for free. It cost \u00a319.51.\n\nI met some friends today. We all live in different parts of the country so Birmingham was the middle ground.\n\nI made sandwiches for the train to save on money and took a bottle of water with me. I had an iced coffee for \u00a33.50. My train ticket cost \u00a336.29.\n\nWe wandered around town then headed to Dishoom for food and cocktails. We split the bill and it's was \u00a350.50. I also had a cheeky beer in Wetherspoons for \u00a32.69.\n\nToday was the first day this week that we didn't spend any money.\n\nThe kids wanted a pyjama day so we watched films and ate Easter eggs. I think shared experiences are all that matters. You don't have to throw loads of money at things. Time is the nicest gift that you can give people, especially your kids.\n\nJanine's train journey was cheaper because she bought tickets in advance\n\nMy total week's spending was \u00a3399.19 excluding my regular costs and extra income from selling things.\n\nWhen you break it down day by day, it seems crazy. But this wasn't a normal week for me. When the kids are off you end up spending much more money.\n\nI hope people realise that there are ways to still enjoy your life without having to fork out loads. Promotions, vouchers and apps can bring the price down. When you're doing it everyday it really adds up.\n\nAs told to Yazmina Garcia.

Brecon Beacons National Park will now be calling itself only by its Welsh name, Bannau Brycheiniog\n\nThe decision was aimed at promoting local culture and heritage, as part of a wider overhaul of how the park is managed.\n\nThe new campaign group - called \"Our Bannau Brycheiniog/Brecon Beacons\" - is made up of range of businesses in the fields of tourism, farming, green energy, hospitality and retail.\n\nHelen Howarth says losing the English language name will hurt tourism\n\nThey said they were proud of operating in a bilingual nation and believed \"this tradition must be protected and respected\".\n\nThey said they were also seeking legal advice about whether they could mount a High Court challenge, which would argue the park's rebrand conflicts with the 1993 Welsh Language Act obliging public bodies in Wales to treat Welsh and English on an equal basis.\n\n\"I firmly believe that losing our identity as the Brecon Beacons National Park will be detrimental to us all and especially tourism, hospitality and trade,\" said Helen Howarth, who owns a self-catering accommodation business.\n\nThe group has penned an open letter to park bosses calling on them \"to reinstate the bilingual Bannau Brycheiniog/ Brecon Beacons National Park name and brand\".\n\nThey say a number of the campaign's signatories are part of a scheme to be official ambassadors for the park and were \"not even notified about the renaming and rebranding project before its launch on 17 April\".\n\nNigel Kilgallon says the name change seems like \"an act of sabotage\"\n\nNigel Kilgallon, who runs a B&B in Brecon and is a town councillor, said the name change highlights the disconnect between the authority that runs the national park, and the local community.\n\n\"You could call it a trademark, you could call it intellectual property, you could call it a marketing tool. All these things that it could be. But it's also the home of the people that live here. Our Brecon Beacons,\" he said.\n\n\"And so to just change it, just seems like an act of sabotage. It's either that or it's just ill-thought out by the authority.\n\n\"It's what it's always known as and that bilingualism is really at the heart of what we're trying to do here.\"\n\nOwen Williams, the managing director of a digital marketing agency, said he found it difficult to understand the campaigners' argument.\n\nThe attention the national park had received through its decision in recent weeks had been \"unreal\", he claimed.\n\n\"It's been a very canny marketing strategy,\" he said.\n\nReferring to moves in other countries such as Australia to focus on the indigenous names for iconic sites he said \"tourism doesn't drop because the Ayres Rock name is minimised and Uluru brought to the fore\".\n\nA spokeswoman for Bannau Brycheiniog National Park Authority said the organisation had \"decided to prioritise the Welsh name going forwards\".She added: \"The park is not asking other people or organisations to prioritise the Welsh name.

It was simply that this \"amazing chapter\" of her life had \"naturally come to an end\".\n\n\"I am a mum now and I never really gave myself a maternity leave and I got straight back into work instantly because my work is my phone and showing my life is my work,\" she continued.\n\n\"The last thing I would want to be is in a role that I can't fulfil right this moment.\"\n\nHer departure comes two months after longstanding PrettyLittleThing founder Umar Kamani left the Boohoo Group brand, to pursue new opportunities.\n\nIn 2021, Hague announced she was taking a new direction by accepting a senior job with the label. \"I'm excited to be a creative director - I'm not an influencer any more and people can see that, it's become a lot more than that,\" she told Radio 1 Newsbeat.\n\n\"I'm basically going to eat, sleep, breathe PrettyLittleThing - although I do that anyway\".\n\nIt was a big and controversial signing at the time, with some commentators suggesting it was unfair she had walked from the Love Island villa into a hugely influential fashion job.\n\nHague argued she had worked hard and was passionate about the brand, one she had decided to work with despite having been offered more money to go elsewhere.\n\nShe said she had turned down an offer of \u00a32 million to work with a high street brand, simply because she did not wear their clothes.\n\nAt the time she said she wanted to improve the inclusivity of the brand by creating clothes in sizes 4-30, as well as encouraging people to remove cosmetic fillers, if, like her, they had felt they'd made a mistake.\n\n\"I think for me it was a journey of accepting that you don't need to get all these things done to your face, you're fine the way you are,\" she said.\n\nHague was also criticised for her involvement with the company after PrettyLittleThing owner BooHoo was accused of paying garment workers in Leicester only \u00a33.50 per hour following a 2020 investigation by The Sunday Times.\n\nThe following year, BooHoo said: \"We recognise the risks of poor labour practices, human rights abuses and modern slavery in complex global supply chains and we are committed to establishing robust due diligence programmes and collaborating with others from the industry, authorities and NGOs to tackle poor practices and protect those people who are most vulnerable.\"\n\nLast year, Hague had an Instagram post banned after she failed to include any mention of it being an advert.\n\nIt was the third time she had been in trouble with the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA).\n\nShe posted a picture of her wearing a PrettyLittleThing dress, along with a link to buy it, on her story.\n\nThe ASA said it was not \"immediately clear\" that she had a commercial interest in PLT. The brand confirmed their contract expressly stated the requirement for her to include the \"\u00a3ad\" disclosure in posts.", "Bridlington Coastguard Rescue Team says technicians carried the \"very friendly\" dog back up the cliff using a rescue bag\n\nThe owners of a dog which fell 160ft (49m) down a cliff on the East Yorkshire coast say it's a \"miracle\" she's still alive.\n\nSandra Costin was walking Button the Cockapoo in Flamborough on Thursday morning when she disappeared through a gate.\n\nAfter birdwatchers spotted her running about in the cove below, a coastguard team abseiled down and rescued her.\n\n\"It's unbelievable, we can't really believe it,\" her owner said.\n\nMrs Costin, from Oxton in Nottinghamshire, was on holiday with husband Brian and walking Button off the lead through fields near Thornwick Bay Holiday Park at the time.\n\n\"I turned my eyes away from her for a second and it was done, as easy as that,\" Mrs Costin said.\n\n\"People started to help us, a man with binoculars looked over the edge and said, 'I can see a dog'.\"\n\nThe coastguard was contacted on 999, with the what3words app used to give rescuers the cliff's location.\n\nButton required a back operation after the fall but is now recovering at home\n\nMrs Costin said: \"We could see her walking around and that was such a miraculous thing, we thought she'd obviously be dead at the bottom of the cliff.\n\n\"We still don't know how she escaped because it's so far down, it's a miracle.\"\n\nPraising the team who rescued the dog, Brian Costin said: \"Everything was so organised, they abseiled down and they were there in about a minute.\n\n\"She got out of the [rescue] bag and I really couldn't believe she was alive.\"\n\nButton's owners said the dog required an operation on her back on Tuesday and was recovering at home.\n\nOwners Sandra and Brian Costin, from Oxton in Nottinghamshire, praised both the coastguard and vets for their actions\n\nMrs Costin added: \"I'll never get over not having her on a lead, but when we're in fields she likes to run around and she always comes back if you shout her.\"\n\nBridlington Coastguard Rescue Team said two technicians descended the cliff and were \"met by a very friendly dog\".\n\n\"This is an important reminder that when walking dogs on cliff top paths, ensure they are kept on a lead,\" a coastguard spokesperson said.\n\n\"Never put yourself in danger, dial 999 and ask for the coastguard.\"\n\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

Some analysts have predicted interest rates will peak at 6.5%, but some have said they may rise to as high as 7%.\n\nThe theory behind raising interest rates is that by making it more expensive for people to borrow money, and more worthwhile for people to save, people will spend less, which will in turn lead to price rises to slow.\n\nMr Bailey said in his speech to executives at the same Mansion House event \"it is crucial that we see the job through, meet our mandate to return inflation to its 2% target, and provide the environment of price stability in which the UK economy can thrive\".\n\nHe added that while the UK economy has failed to grow beyond its pre-pandemic level, there had been \"unexpected resilience\" in the face of external shocks, such as Covid and the war in Ukraine, with low levels of unemployment and avoiding a recession to date.\n\nBut the Bank of England's boss highlighted that \"tightness\" in the labour market, with many businesses struggling to find enough workers, has contributed to price inflation being \"more sticky than previously expected\".\n\n\"Both price and wage increases at current rates are not consistent with the inflation target,\" he added.\n\nThe Bank of England has previously warned big pay rises are contributing to the UK's still-high rates of inflation, but there have also been accusations that some sectors have been profiteering by overcharging customers.\n\nLast week, the Competition and Markets Authority revealed supermarkets had sought to increase profits from selling fuel, increasing their margins by 6p per litre on average between 2019 and 2022.\n\nThe chancellor said \"delivering sound money is our number one focus\", before he delivered his speech focusing on plans for pension fund reforms.\n\nMr Hunt pledged the plans could provide a \u00a31,000-a-year pensions boost to the typical earner who starts saving at 18.\n\nWhile UK pension pots are the largest in Europe, worth \u00a32.5trn, defined contribution schemes currently invest 1% in unlisted equity, limiting returns for savers and funding for businesses, the Treasury has claimed.\n\nThe chancellor revealed an agreement with leading pensions firms to put 5% of their investments into early-stage businesses in the fintech, life sciences, biotech and clean technology sectors by 2030.\n\nThe so-called \"Mansion House Compact\" has been backed by Aviva, Scottish Widows, Legal & General, Aegon, Phoenix, NEST, Mercer, M&G and Smart Pension.\n\nAhead of the event, Mansion House organisers said talks had taken place about security at the venue over concerns of protests. A source told the BBC the event was not disrupted.", "On the night a dozen of Donald Trump's Republican rivals spoke at the same event in Iowa, only one challenged the former president head on - and he was roundly booed. It highlights the grip Mr Trump still has on his party.\n\nSomeone backstage at the Lincoln Dinner clearly had a mischievous sense of humour.\n\nAs each of the candidates hoping to become the Republican Party's presidential nominee for 2024 walked out to speak they were accompanied by a blast of music: a clip of the country song Only In America.\n\nWhen it was Mr Trump's turn, two lyrics, describing two alternative paths that could await someone in the US, seemed particularly poignant:\n\nOne could end up going to prison\n\nOne just might be president\n\nThe 45th President of the United States didn't seem to mind. He doesn't try to hide from the fact that he is already facing two criminal trials and may soon be indicted in two more cases. In fact, he wears these charges as a badge of pride.\n\nMr Trump insists he is being unfairly targeted for purely political reasons.\n\nHe told the crowd of 1,200 Republican supporters at this dinner in Iowa - a key state because it will hold the first election in the race for the nomination next January - that he would not have been prosecuted if he was not running for the White House again. And he would not have been prosecuted if he was not winning.\n\nUsing serious criminal charges as a mark of success takes chutzpah. But that is something Mr Trump has always had in spades. And it leaves his opponents deeply confused about how to respond.\n\nMost simply chose to ignore Thursday evening's news that Mr Trump had been charged with three more counts in the classified documents investigation. In fact, they declined to take the opportunity to challenge the clear frontrunner in the contest at all.\n\nOne of the lesser known contenders, Will Hurd, did take a shot. The former Texas Congressman and CIA officer claimed Donald Trump was not running to make America great again.\n\n\"Donald Trump is not running for president to represent the people that voted for him in 2016 or 2020. Donald Trump is running to stay out of prison.\"\n\nLoud boos and rattling cutlery nearly drowned out the rest of what he had to say, with one man shouting \"go home\".

He and many others in the ballroom repeated unproven allegations about Hunter's business dealings and claims of foreign influence (which the White House has dismissed but Republicans in Congress are investigating).\n\nThere was no fun to be had watching the different candidates interacting with each other at the dinner.

WATCH: How the Match of the Day row played out on Saturday... in 60 seconds\n\nMatch of the Day went ahead on BBC One on Saturday night - but was reduced to a 20-minute edition that did not have a presenter, pundits or any commentary - while other football coverage was dropped.\n\nEvery cancelled programme is a source of further complaint from licence payers who may not care what Lineker says on Twitter but care deeply about their favourite programmes staying on air on a Saturday night.\n\nThere is also the wider context of a government that has in recent years been critical of the BBC and its perceived liberal bias.\n\nGreg Dyke, a former director general, who left the BBC over a clash with the Labour Government in 2004, says the decision to pull Gary Lineker from Match of the Day looks like a corporation bowing to political pressure from a Tory government.\n\nAll of which leads to another issue that asks questions of the BBC's impartiality, the BBC's chairman, Richard Sharp, a former donor to the Conservative party who is the subject of an ongoing inquiry looking in to his appointment and what he did or did not disclose about his part in the arrangement of an \u00a3800,000 loan guarantee to the former prime minister, Boris Johnson. He has denied any involvement in arranging the loan.\n\nLineker has become a lightning rod for a much bigger debate and the BBC would like to resolve the issue as quickly as possible to stop a very public row turning into a monumental crisis. However, with the corporation saying it wants Lineker, with his 8.7 million Twitter followers, to stop the political tweets while he shows no sign of agreeing to be silenced, it's hard to see quite how this will resolve itself.\n\nFor the BBC this is about impartiality but to many others it is about free speech. Indeed, there is a statue outside the BBC's headquarters in London of the author of 1984, George Orwell, a former BBC talks producer. Inscribed on the wall behind the Orwell statue are these words: \"If liberty means anything at all it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.\"\n\nEighty years after Orwell left the BBC, the corporation finds itself in a deepening crisis. That thought from Orwell and the questions it raises for the BBC are at the very heart of the Lineker debate.", "Israel's military said the strike on World Central Kitchen's convoy was a \"grave mistake\" and vowed to protect aid workers\n\nMany Palestinians in the Gaza Strip will be wondering how they are going to feed their families after World Central Kitchen (WCK) paused its operations in response to the killing of seven of its aid workers in an Israeli air strike.\n\nAnother US charity it works with, Anera, has also suspended work because of the escalating risks faced by its local staff and their families.\n\nTogether, they were serving two million meals a week across the Palestinian territory, where the UN has warned that an estimated 1.1 million people - half the population - are facing catastrophic hunger because of Israeli restrictions on aid deliveries, the ongoing hostilities and the breakdown of order.\n\nWCK's decision to pause its work also led to the \"freezing\" of a maritime aid corridor from Cyprus, which the charity helped set up last month to increase the trickle of aid getting into the north of Gaza and avert a looming famine.\n\nThe WCK convoy was hit on Monday night as it travelled south along the Israeli-designated coastal aid route, just after they had unloaded more than 100 tonnes of food from a barge at a warehouse in Deir al-Balah.\n\nThat barge was part of a four-vessel flotilla that sailed back to Cyprus with 240 tonnes of supplies that could not be brought ashore in the wake of the strike.\n\nThe Norwegian Refugee Council warned that \"what happened to World Central Kitchen threatens the entire aid system\" and had left it \"on the brink\".\n\nBefore the strike, World Central Kitchen was providing about 350,000 meals across Gaza each day\n\nWCK accused the Israeli military of a \"targeted attack\" on vehicles clearly marked with the charity's logo and whose movements had been co-ordinated with Israeli authorities. The victims were British, Polish, Australian and Palestinian, and also included a dual US-Canadian citizen.\n\nThe military's chief of staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, described the strike as a \"grave mistake\" that had followed \"misidentification at night\".\n\nHe also vowed to take \"immediate action\" to ensure that more was done to protect aid workers, including the immediate establishment of a new \"humanitarian command centre\" to improve co-ordination. \"Israel is at war with Hamas, not with the people of Gaza,\" he stressed.\n\nHowever, aid groups say they are not sure such promises will lead to meaningful changes. They also assert that this was not an isolated incident, with 196 Palestinian aid workers reportedly killed since the war began in October.\n\nJan Egeland, the secretary-general of the Norwegian Refugee Council and a former UN humanitarian chief, told the BBC that WCK was \"among those who have the closest co-operation with the Israelis\", in terms of sharing information about their workers' locations and planned movements.\n\nBefore the strike, WCK was playing an increasingly prominent and important role in Gaza, with 400 Palestinian staff and 3,000 people working indirectly for it in its 68 community kitchens and distribution system.\n\nWCK has provided 12% of the 193,000 tonnes of aid from international organisations that had reached Gaza since October, according to data from Cogat, the Israeli defence ministry body tasked with co-ordinating deliveries. However, UN agencies were responsible for 80% of the total.\n\nWCK's founder, the chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, told Reuters news agency on Wednesday that it was \"analysing the situation and how to keep doing the work we do\".\n\nAnera - which was providing 150,000 meals a day in collaboration with WCK - said it understood the consequences pausing its own work would have on Palestinians, but that its Palestinian staff had for the first time deemed the risk to their safety and that of their families \"intolerable\".\n\nIt said the charity's logistics co-ordinator and his son had been killed in an Israeli air strike in Deir al-Balah in March, despite the fact that the co-ordinates of the shelter where they were staying had been provided to the Israeli military.\n\n\"We've asked for explanation as to why that site was struck and we've received none,\" Derek Madsen of Anera told the BBC. \"These sites are known and so I think it is very difficult for us to understand how these strikes happen.\"\n\nProject Hope, another US-based organisation, paused its work for three days in solidarity with WCK and to \"reassess the security situation as we prioritise our staff members' safety\".\n\nArlan Fuller, director of emergency preparedness and response, said in a statement sent to the BBC that its employees were deeply concerned by the deaths of the WCK team, and that the strike has raised significant doubts about the effectiveness of co-ordination with the Israeli military.\n\nFor the people of Gaza, the suspension of WCK's operations \"means more famine, more dead children, more epidemic disease because people are so malnourished\", Mr Egeland warned.\n\nAt least 27 children are reported to have died as a result of malnutrition since October, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nMr Egeland urged Israel to start by opening the Karni and Erez border crossings with northern Gaza to allow aid convoys to drive there directly.\n\nMost aid convoys are currently forced to start at the Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom and Egyptian-controlled Rafah crossings with the south of Gaza and then pass through what the UN calls \"high-risk areas\", mainly due to shooting and shelling or the breakdown in civil order.\n\nCogat says Israeli forces have co-ordinated the entry of more than 500 lorries into the north over the past two months via those routes as well as a new gate and military road that runs south of Gaza City.\n\nIsrael has also facilitated the now-suspended maritime corridor set up by WCK as well as airdrops of aid by Western and Arab countries. The UN says both are helpful but cannot replace the large-scale delivery of aid by land.\n\nThe first WCK aid ship was carrying 200 tonnes of aid and took several days to reach Gaza. By comparison, a lorry can carry about 20 tonnes and the nearest Israeli container port is only a 40km drive from northern Gaza.\n\nA C-130 transport plane meanwhile has a maximum payload of 21 tonnes, but only about 40 airdrops have taken place so far and they are considered expensive, ineffective and dangerous for people on the ground.\n\nThe UN says 159 lorry loads of aid crossed into Gaza by land each day on average between 1 and 28 March, and that the pre-war average was 500 lorry loads, including fuel.\n\nCogat says the pre-war average only included 70 food lorries and that 140 entered each day during March. It insists there is no limit to the amount of food and other humanitarian aid that can enter Gaza and accuses UN agencies of failing to distribute aid effectively.\n\nThe Open Arms. a Spanish charity vessel, returned to Cyprus on Wednesday after the maritime aid route was suspended\n\nThere was no apparent drop-off in aid crossing into Gaza following the strike on the WCK convoy, with 217 lorries transferred via Israel and Egypt on Wednesday and 179 food packages being airdropped, according to Cogat.\n\nBut Nate Mook, who was chief executive of WCK until 2022, warned that the longer-term consequences could be \"devastating\" for Gazans because \"we probably have not seen the last of the aid organisations to pull out\".\n\nZawar Ali of International Medical Corps told the BBC that it was reconsidering its safety protocols and whether to restrict its workers' movements.\n\nIt had already decided to relocate its field hospital from the north of Rafah to al-Mawasi, an area to the west which the Israeli military has declared \"humanitarian zone\" but has still carried out strikes on what it says are Hamas targets.\n\nDr Bashar Murad, the executive director of the Palestinian Red Crescent, said many of its paramedics were refusing to evacuate wounded and sick people from the north to the south in their ambulances due to the lack of safety guarantees, despite their protection under international law and co-ordination efforts by international organisations.\n\nAseel Baidoun of Medical Aid for Palestinians said it had not suspended operations after a strike in January damaged a residential compound in al-Mawasi that housed the British charity's local team and their families, injuring several people. But now, she added: \"We really are scared of the security [situation].\"\n\n\"If a foreigner with international immunity is bombed and killed, then what will they do to us?\" Mohammed Aborjela, a Palestinian online content creator who launched the Youth of Gaza initiative to deliver aid after the war began, told BBC.\n\nHe said Palestinian aid workers faced higher risks and greater challenges than their international colleagues, but insisted it would not stop him and his colleagues continuing their work. \"The danger of not providing aid is no less important than the danger of being killed,\" he added.\n\nNatalia Anguera of Action Against Hunger also said it would try to continue working despite \"more and more challenging\" conditions.\n\n\"Most of our staff are... Palestinians. They are suffering themselves, but they also have a very strong and clear commitment to their humanitarian mandate. They want to go on delivering,\" she told the BBC.\n\nShe said the international community needed to push strongly for a humanitarian ceasefire because it was the only way that aid organisations would be able to scale up their response to the level required.\n\nMr Egeland also stressed the importance of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), which he said was \"bigger than the rest of us combined\" but was being \"systematically undermined by Israel\".\n\nIsrael accuses UNRWA of supporting Hamas, which triggered the war when its gunmen attacked southern Israel on 7 October last year. The agency has denied this, but in January it sacked nine of the 12 employees accused in an Israeli document of playing a part in the attacks.\n\nUNRWA called for a \"complete reversal in policies\" from Israel in response to Monday's strike, including lifting the ban on it delivering aid to northern Gaza.", "The victim was found outside a house in Brentwick Gardens on Wednesday morning\n\nPolice say 10 people have been arrested on suspicion of murder after a man was fatally stabbed in London.\n\nOfficers said the man was found in the street with serious injuries in Brentwick Gardens, Brentford, at 05:15 BST and died at the scene.\n\nIt came after the force was alerted to reports of intruders at an address in the same street.\n\nSeven men and three women were subsequently detained and remain in custody.\n\nDet Supt Figo Forouzan, from Met Police, said: \"This is a truly shocking incident that will understandably cause the community concerns.\n\n\"I want to reassure the Hounslow residents that we have commenced a thorough investigation with the support of our homicide investigation team to ensure those responsible are brought to justice.\"\n\nThe force has appealed for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.", "This is the fourth time in as many months that the prime minister has met President Biden.\n\nI have been in tow each time, and it's been fascinating to get a glimpse of their growing relationship.\n\nAnd quite some growing it's had to do.\n\nWhen Rishi Sunak became prime minister, President Biden, in congratulating him, managed to call him Rashee Sanook.\n\nNot long after that, Mr Sunak acknowledged to me that the UK's reputation had \"taken a bit of a knock,\" courtesy of the rolling political chaos of much of 2022.\n\nCore to his brand as prime minister is attempting to personify the opposite: hoping to be seen as dependable, believable, credible, trustworthy.\n\nLittle wonder, then, he ducked a question on the way here about what he made of Prince Harry's remarks that the UK is judged globally by the state of the press and the government - both of which the prince reckons are at \"rock bottom.\"\n\nBut, having tried to prove he can be the gentle jazz of politics rather than the heavy metal that came before, the challenge for Rishi Sunak now is delivery, and quickly, with a general election expected next year.\n\nUkraine will be a recurring theme on this trip.\n\nMr Sunak has told us the UK is looking into who was to blame for the destruction of the huge dam there.\n\nHe said it was too soon to make \"a definitive judgement.\"\n\nBut, he added, if it was intentional, it would represent \"the largest attack on civilian infrastructure in Ukraine since the start of the war.\"\n\nThe UK and US's ongoing support for Kyiv will be central to the discussions between the leaders at the White House on Thursday.\n\nRishi Sunak and Joe Biden met in Japan, last month\n\nAlso on the agenda, the regulation of artificial intelligence and economic cooperation.\n\nOn AI, the prime minister is expected to make the case that the UK can be a global leader on its development and regulation.\n\nAnd on the economy, Rishi Sunak has said he will \"continue discussing\" America's Inflation Reduction Act - which has seen billions in new subsidies targeted at green industries in the US - with some fretting the UK is being left behind.\n\nYou can read more about it here from my colleague Faisal Islam.\n\nThe gulf between the president and the prime minister's instincts on this is wide, if not surprising: a Democratic president opting for massive state intervention, in the hope of greening his economy, reviving left behind areas and bringing manufacturing back to the US.\n\nAnd a Conservative prime minister not naturally drawn towards huge interventions like this - and suggesting \"subsidy races,\" as he put it, were a \"zero sum\" game.\n\nBut even if there is a philosophical opposition from some to what the president is doing, what are the political responses to it?\n\nRishi Sunak said \"we've created lots of jobs\" in green industries and \"reduced carbon faster\" than comparable countries.\n\nHe doesn't believe attempting the same plan as Washington would be wise.\n\nMeanwhile, Rachel Reeves - who hopes to become the UK's first ever female chancellor if Labour win the next election - was in the US capital just a few weeks ago, and openly embracing a strategy very similar to Joe Biden's.\n\nIs her plan affordable, and achievable?

He had been referred to addiction services on a number of occasions.\n\nAn examination of his body detected heroin, fentanyl and cocaine in his system, as well as xylazine.\n\nA report on his death in the Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine says he was \"likely to have bought heroin and not known it was laced with xylazine and fentanyl\".\n\n\"To the best of our knowledge, this is the first death associated with xylazine use reported in the UK, and even Europe, and indicates the entry of xylazine into the UK drug supply,\" it adds.\n\nXylazine is used by vets as a powerful sedative but it's not approved for use in humans.\n\nKnown as \"tranq\" or \"tranq dope\" when cut with heroin and fentanyl by drug dealers, xylazine has been causing huge problems in the US.\n\nIf injected directly into someone's bloodstream, it can cause large open skin ulcers to form. These can start to rot and lead to amputation.\n\nIt also lowers breathing and heart rate to dangerously low levels, which has led to it being dubbed a \"flesh-eating zombie drug\".\n\nXylazine emerged on the illicit drug market in Puerto Rico in the early 2000s and has since been found in the US, mainly in the east, and in Canada.\n\nThe US government has called it \"an emerging threat\" because of its growing role in fatal overdoses across the country - about 7% of the total.\n\nAnd in some states, the drug was found in more than a quarter of overdoses.\n\nBut until now, there has been no sign of xylazine in the UK.\n\nThe drug was detected only because the Birmingham lab that carried out tests after the man's death noticed some strange results and identified xylaxine.\n\n\"The drug is not included in standard drug screens in the UK, so we don't know how widespread the xylazine problem is,\" said Dr Caroline Copeland, King's College London lecturer and director of the National Programme on Substance Abuse Deaths.\n\n\"We need to find out how that person ended up with it in his system.\"\n\nXylazine was listed on the man's death certificate as contributing to his death but there was no way of recording it in the UK drug-deaths database.\n\nThe report highlights the need to monitor changes in illicit-drug markets and in emerging drugs.\n\n\"There is no safe dose to use\", it concludes, because there is an overlap between fatal and non-fatal doses of xylazine reported in people.", "James Gallagher wired up for the heatwave experiment\n\nSometimes it can feel like the world is on fire.\n\nEurope has been baking in a heatwave nicknamed the settimana infernale - \"week of hell\" - in Italy. Temperatures above 50C have been recorded in China and the US, where body bags filled with ice are being used to cool hospital patients. The UK has just had its hottest ever June.\n\nAnd in 2022, the UK recorded a temperature above 40C for the first time. Last year's heatwave has been blamed for 60,000 deaths across Europe.\n\nIt's no wonder the United Nations has warned we now live in the era of \"global boiling\".\n\n\"I think it's really important to realise it's no longer just something that's distant or far away from us or something in the future. We are really seeing it now,\" says Prof Lizzie Kendon from the Met Office.\n\nSo what does the changing climate mean for our bodies and our health?\n\nI tend to collapse into a sweaty puddle when it gets hot, but I've been invited to take part in a heatwave experiment.\n\nProf Damian Bailey from the University of South Wales wants to give me a typical heatwave encounter. So we're going to start at 21C, crank up the thermostat to 35C and then finally up to 40.3C - equivalent to the UK's hottest day.\n\n\"You will be sweating and your body's physiology is going to change quite considerably,\" Prof Bailey warns me.\n\nProf Bailey leads me into his environmental chamber. It's a room-sized piece of scientific equipment that can precisely control the temperature, humidity and oxygen levels inside this airtight space.\n\nI've been here once before to explore the effects of cold.\n\nBut the shiny steel walls, heavy door and tiny portholes take on new meaning in anticipation of the temperature being cranked up.\n\nI feel like I'm staring out of my oven.\n\nThe temperature starts at a perfectly pleasant 21C when the first instruction to \"completely strip everything off\" comes from Prof Bailey.\n\nIn response to a raised eyebrow, I'm reassured we're going to work out how sweaty I get, by seeing how my weight changes.\n\nJames getting wired up for the experiment inside the environmental chamber at the University of South Wales.\n\nNext, I'm connected to a dizzying array of gizmos tracking the temperature of my skin and my internal organs, my heart rate and blood pressure. A huge mouthpiece analyses the air I exhale and an ultrasound inspects the flow of blood to my brain through the carotid arteries in my neck.\n\n\"Blood pressure is working nicely, heart rate is working nicely, all of the physiological signals at the moment are telling me that you're in spiffing shape,\" Prof Bailey tells me.\n\nWe have one quick brain test to complete - memorising a list of 30 words - and then the fans kick in. The temperature is starting to rise.\n\nMy body has one simple goal - to keep the core temperature around my heart, lungs, liver and other organs at about 37C.\n\n\"The thermostat in the brain, or hypothalamus, is constantly tasting the temperature, then it sends out all of these signals to try to maintain that,\" says Prof Bailey.\n\nWe take a pause at 35C to take some more measurements. It's warm in here now. It's not uncomfortable - I'm just relaxing in a chair - but I wouldn't want to work or exercise in this.\n\nProf Bailey is also feeling the heat inside the chamber\n\nSome changes in my body are already clear. I look redder. Damian does too, he's stuck in here with me. That's because the blood vessels near the surface of my skin are opening up to make it easier for my warm blood to lose heat into the air.\n\nAlso I'm sweating - not dripping, but positively glistening - and as the sweat evaporates, that cools me down.\n\nWe then plough on to 40.3C, and now I feel like the heat is pounding me.\n\n\"It's not linear, it's exponential. Five degrees centigrade [more] doesn't sound much, but it really is physiologically so much more of a challenge,\" Prof Bailey says.\n\nI'm glad we're not going higher. When I wipe my hand across my brow it is sodden. It's time to repeat the tests.\n\nWhen I chuck my sweaty clothes on the floor, towel off and climb back on the scales I'm shocked to learn I've lost more than a third of a litre's worth of water during the course of the experiment.\n\nThe cost of opening up all those blood vessels near my skin to lose heat is also clear. My heart rate has increased significantly and at 40C it is pumping an extra litre of blood per minute around my body than it was at 21C.\n\nThis extra strain on the heart is why there is an increase in deaths from heart attacks and strokes when temperatures soar.\n\nAnd as the blood heads to my skin, it's my brain that loses out. Blood flow goes down and so does my short-term memory.\n\nBut my body's main goal - keeping my core temperature at around 37C - has been achieved.\n\n\"Your body is working really quite nicely to try to defend that core temperature, but of course, the numbers are suggesting you weren't the same beast at 40 degrees as you were at 21 and that's in less than an hour,\" says Prof Bailey.\n\nIn my experiment only the temperature was changed, but the other crucial factor to consider is the amount of water vapour in the air - the humidity.\n\nIf you've ever been really uncomfortable on a muggy night then you can blame the humidity as it impairs our body's ability to cool down.\n\nSweating alone isn't enough - it's only when the sweat evaporates into the air that it gives us that cooling effect.\n\nWhen there are high levels of water already in the air, it's harder for sweat to evaporate.\n\nDamian kept the humidity fixed at 50% (not unusual for the UK), but a team at Pennsylvania State University in the US tested a bunch of healthy young adults at different combinations of temperature and humidity. They were looking for the moment when core body temperature started to rise rapidly.\n\n\"That's when it becomes dangerous. Our core temperature starts to rise and that can lead to organ failure,\" says researcher Rachel Cottle.\n\nAnd that danger point is reached at lower temperatures when the humidity is high.\n\nThe concern is that heatwaves are not only becoming more frequent, longer in duration and more severe, but they're becoming more humid too, says Cottle.\n\nShe points out that last year, India and Pakistan were hit by a severe heatwave with both critical temperatures and high humidity. \"It's definitely a 'now' problem, not a future problem,\" she says.\n\nThe human body is built to operate at a core temperature of about 37C degrees. We become more light-headed and prone to fainting as the core rises closer to 40C.\n\nHigh core temperatures damage our body's tissues, such as heart muscle and the brain. Eventually this becomes deadly.\n\n\"Once the core temperature rises to around about 41-42 degrees centigrade we start to see really, really significant problems and if not treated the individual will actually die as a result, succumbing to hyperthermia,\" says Prof Bailey.\n\nPeople's ability to cope with the heat varies, but age and ill health can make us far more vulnerable, and temperatures we may have once enjoyed on holidays may be dangerous at a different stage in life.\n\n\"You're going to leave the lab today with a smile on your face - all of these statistics coming are telling me that you have risen to the challenge and you've done a jolly good job,\" says Prof Bailey\n\nBut old age, heart disease, lung disease, dementia and some medications mean the body is already working harder to keep going, and is less able to respond to the heat.\n\n\"Every day it's a physiological challenge for them, now when you throw in extra spicy heat and humidity, sometimes they can't rise to that challenge,\" says Prof Bailey.\n\nMany of the tips for coping with the heat are obvious and well known - stay in the shade, wear loose fitting clothes, avoid alcohol, keep your house cool, don't exercise in the hottest parts of the day and stay hydrated (you saw how much I sweated in an hour).\n\n\"Another tip is try not to get sunburned. A mild sunburn can knock out the ability to thermoregulate or to sweat for as long as two weeks,\" says Prof Bailey.\n\nBut dealing with the heat is something we could all have to become used to dealing with.\n\nWithout action on climate change Prof Lizzie Kendon said the hottest UK summer day could increase by 6C under a high-emission scenario: \"That's a huge increase by the end of the century.\"\n\nInside Health was produced by Gerry Holt and Dan Welsh.\n\u2022 None The new normal - why this summer has been so very hot", "King Charles has delivered a speech partly in German at Bellevue Palace in Berlin during a state visit to the country, his first since becoming monarch.\n\nThe monarch made several jokes and praised the ties between the UK and Germany.\n\nThe King and his wife Camilla, the Queen Consort, attended a state banquet hosted by German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.\n\nAmong those in attendance were the first lady Elke B\u00fcdenbender, as well as dignitaries from both Germany and the UK, including former Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Poppy hopes her story will change attitudes and help others.\n\nThe 18-year-old has set aside her right to anonymity because she believes \"if people can see a face behind something so taboo, it makes it more relatable\".\n\nShe describes how, as a small child, she thought the abuse she suffered was normal - and how she felt enormous relief when she eventually told her parents, aged 11.\n\nOnly by talking openly, says Poppy, will others understand that abuse can happen within any family.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Poppy says she \"lost a lot of family\" after helping jail her grandfather\n\n\"Why should we be hidden? It is a crime, as simple as that,\" she says.\n\n\"I am like any other person probably going through it. Survivors are very good at acting like nothing is wrong, people didn't see it in me.\"\n\nPoppy is speaking out as new data shows more cases of child sexual abuse are being reported to police in England and Wales than ever before.\n\nThere were 105,542 sexual offences recorded against children in the year up to March.\n\nThe Home Office figures have been analysed for the BBC by the Centre of Expertise on Child Sexual Abuse (CSA Centre), which studies the causes, impact and scale of abuse. The centre says greater awareness is a key reason for a 57% increase in recorded offences over six years.\n\nChild sexual abuse within a family environment accounts for nearly half the cases.\n\nThat's why Poppy believes talking publicly will help children realise that someone will listen to them.\n\nIt's a hot summer's day. At a busy airfield in Kent, Poppy is pulling on overalls and being helped into a parachute harness.\n\nFour days after finishing her A-levels and a week before her 18th birthday, she is about to jump out of a plane to raise money for a charity that helped her deal with the abuse that blighted her early years.\n\nPoppy believes doing her first skydive mirrors the \"scary leap\" you take when you tell someone about abuse.\n\nHer mother, Miranda, is there to support her. Her father, David, is working away, but she video calls him just before she climbs into the plane.\n\nThey are a close family. They've had to be to survive the toughest of times.\n\nPoppy compares skydiving to taking the leap to tell someone about her abuse\n\nThey believe Poppy was first abused when she was a toddler.\n\n\"I thought grandparents did that to their grandchildren,\" says Poppy. \"I thought that was quite normal.\"\n\nDavid's father, John, would help out by looking after Poppy when needed.\n\n\"I knew the cues,\" Poppy says. When the regular children's programme she watched with him ended, then the abuse would begin.\n\nToday Poppy is eloquent and thoughtful, but as she casts her mind back to that time she falters as she searches for words.\n\n\"It would always start with: 'Can you help me come and get dressed?' And I'd have to go to his bedroom. I was made to do things to him, he would then do things to me.\"\n\nWhen I say to her that she was groomed, she says yes and describes the complex relationship she had with her paternal grandfather. She says she felt so much shame and believed she was in the wrong, so wanted to protect him.\n\nAt the age of five, just before going on a trip to Legoland, she tried to tell her mother about the abuse.\n\nA photo taken that day shows a little girl with long blonde plaits smiling up at her parents. If it is hard for Poppy to find the right words now, this is a reminder of how impossible it must have been at such a young age.\n\nPoppy tried to tell her parents what was happening when she was five\n\n\"She started to tell us, then giggled,\" says Miranda. \"We just didn't really realise what she was trying to tell us.\"\n\nHer parents thought she had seen John when he had come out of the shower. David spoke to his father.\n\n\"His immediate response was - 'I might have got changed in front of her,'\" says David. His father promised it wouldn't happen again.\n\n\"He literally shut it down completely, but in a calm way. And I thought, OK! He is my dad!\"\n\nThe abuse stopped, but as Poppy grew, so did her anxiety. She describes the guilt she felt as \"eating her alive\".\n\nA teenager's story of survival and making a difference. By talking openly about the sexual abuse that devastated her early life, Poppy is determined to challenge the taboos that make it difficult for survivors to ask for and get help.\n\nAt school, aged 10 and 11, Poppy was having lessons warning about sexual exploitation and grooming. She began to recognise what had happened to her.\n\n\"I'm sat there thinking, 'I'm involved in that',\" Poppy says. \"That's me, that's dark. That's disgusting.\"\n\nThe CSA Centre says an estimated one child in every 10 will have their life damaged by some form of sexual abuse by the age of 16.\n\nThen came a day when Poppy was being physically sick. Her mother suggested they go for a walk. It was then Poppy took the leap and told her about the abuse.\n\n\"I just needed to keep her safe,\" says Poppy's mother Miranda\n\n\"It was sickening,\" says Miranda. \"She obviously saw the look on my face, and was like, 'Mum, please don't tell anybody. I don't want anything to happen to him. I love him.' She immediately said, 'It's my fault. I'm not a nice person.'\"\n\nMiranda says she was \"clueless\" as to what to do next. \"I'd never even come across anyone that had been through this. I just needed to keep her safe.\"\n\nPoppy had been worried about her mum's reaction, but says it was an immediate \"we are going to get through this\". The relief she felt was huge, because \"it was now in other people's hands\".\n\nThey headed home, and as Miranda puts it: \"Cried a lot, then it was, how do I tell David?\"\n\nShe phoned her husband - as he was working away.\n\nHe describes his \"huge mixed emotions\" when he heard the news.\n\n\"I had to make this call to ultimately report my father,\" he says. \"It was incredibly tough. However, she's my daughter, and she comes first.\"\n\nThe grandfather never admitted what he had done - says child protection officer Det Con Deniz Aslan\n\nPoppy was then interviewed by Det Con Deniz Aslan, from Kent Police's child protection team, along with a social worker.\n\nDet Con Aslan remembers the 11-year-old being very anxious. This was the first time she had explained to anyone exactly what her grandfather had done.\n\n\"Any sexual abuse of a child is serious,\" DC Aslan says. \"But the rape of an under 13-year-old, I don't think you get more serious than that.\"\n\nShe says the grandfather never admitted what he had done.\n\nMiranda's voice breaks as she describes being told by the police the details of what had happened.\n\n\"She was being raped by him. And she felt responsible for it. No child should feel responsible for that,\" she says.\n\n\"Poppy would never give us the full detail of what he'd done. She was trying to protect us.\"\n\nFor David, there was the distress of knowing his father was the abuser.\n\n\"He was abusing our daughter, and then five minutes later, he was having a cup of tea with us. So I felt, who is this man?\n\n\"But then equally, as a child, I had many happy memories. There was a real conflict going on in my mind.\"\n\nPoppy's parents sold their business and moved house to keep her safe\n\nIt took 18 months for the case against the grandfather, John, to reach trial.\n\nAcross England and Wales, only 12% of reported offences result in charges - according to the CSA Centre - and it typically takes nearly two years for those to get to court.\n\nPoppy's recorded interview was played, then she was cross-examined. She had just turned 13.\n\n\"I was so desperate to fight my own corner,\" she says. \"In some ways, there was a good amount of anger behind me, so telling my side of the story was incredibly important.\"\n\nIn 2018, John was found guilty on three counts, including rape, and was jailed for 13-and-a-half years.\n\nThe judge described Poppy's testimony as \"heart-rending\" and \"utterly compelling\". John's defence that she had made it up at her parents' instigation was described as \"quite absurd\".\n\nHe died in prison last year.\n\nThe conviction was important for Poppy, but so was the counselling she received. She had to wait five months for that support - now, it can take much longer. At Family Matters in Kent, where Poppy went, they have more than 300 abuse survivors waiting.\n\n\"When you want help, you want help now,\" says the charity's chief executive, Mary Trevillion - whose team spends a lot of time risk assessing people while they wait for a counsellor.\n\nShe also finds many people hide what has happened to them, only asking for help when they are adults.\n\nThe Home Office told us it was significantly increasing support for victims of child sexual abuse - including quadrupling money for victims' services by 2024-25.\n\nIt also said it recognised that child sexual abuse was an \"often-hidden\" crime, and that was why the government was making it \"mandatory for those who work with young people to report any suspicions that a child is being sexually abused or exploited\".\n\nThe small plane climbs high into the cloudless sky.\n\nPoppy is doing the skydive to raise money for a helpline that supports abuse survivors while they wait to see a counsellor. So far, she has raised more than \u00a370,000.\n\nPoppy and her instructor shuffle to the edge of the plane's open door - the patchwork fields of Kent spreads out beneath them.\n\nPoppy says her life now is \"incredible\"\n\nMinutes later, Poppy is on the ground - safe and laughing.\n\n\"You've got that initial panic,\" she says, \"but then it's just that relief to jump out - you are in it now, you've got to do it.\"\n\nThinking back to the 11-year-old who found the courage to tell her mother about the abuse, Poppy says \"I'd give her a massive hug. Without her strength, I don't think I'd be here today and the life I have now is incredible.\"\n\nHer message to others who are struggling with abuse is \"take that jump\" - tell someone.\n\n\"I can't promise you will be believed by everyone,\" she says. \"But I can promise there is someone who will believe you, and there is a way through this.\"\n\nIf you are affected by any of the issues in this article you can find details of organisations that can help via the BBC Action line.", "Tyler McDermott was found with a gunshot injury on Norman Road\n\nTwo men have been arrested after a teenager died in a shooting in north London.\n\nTyler McDermott, 17, was found by the emergency services on Norman Road in Tottenham at about 04:20 BST on Thursday and died on Friday .\n\nThe Met said two 19-year-olds have been arrested on suspicion of murder and remain in custody.\n\nThe detective leading the investigation appealed to a group of people at the scene at the time to come forward.\n\nDet Ch Insp Neil John said: \"There is still significant work to do to identify those involved in Tyler's murder.\n\n\"There were a large number of people in the area at the time of Tyler's murder and I am reiterating my appeal to anyone who was there, or who has information about this incident, to contact police immediately.\"\n\nThe Met added Tyler's family continue to be supported by specialist officers and a post-mortem examination is scheduled to take place on Sunday.\n\nFollow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Six other children remain in hospital.\n\nThe school is at the heart of this central Belgrade community, where streams of mourners are arriving, bearing flowers and soft toys.\n\nExactly 24 hours after the worst school shooting in Serbian history, pupils from the next-door college stand along the street to stand in silence and remember those killed.\n\n\"I am crushed,\" says final-year school student Alex Oborina, 19, beside some of the handwritten notes left on the pavement.\n\n\"We have failed as a society because this is something that should not happen to a 13-year-old. He should not be grabbing a gun and going into his school and shooting his friends.\"\n\nAlex seems to echo the sentiment everyone here feels.\n\n\"This is probably the worst thing that has ever happened in my life. We need to use this as a stepping stone to rebuild. \"\n\nAlex Oborina believes the children's parents will never have justice for what happened\n\nI ask if the suspect's age of 13 will make it even harder for Serbian society to come to terms with this attack because he is too young to face prosecution.\n\n\"Whatever happened, even if he had been 18 or 19, justice would never have been served for those parents who lost their children.\"\n\nThe boy was arrested by police immediately after the shooting. His father who legally owned both guns was also detained, as was his mother.\n\nHis lawyer, Irina Borovic, says he has been interviewed by doctors and has now been taken to a Belgrade neurology and psychiatry clinic for children and youth.\n\nThe motive for the attack remains unclear.\n\nBut of the victims, seven of the eight who were killed were girls.\n\nFurther down the hill, candle wax oozes down on to the stems of white lilies resting against a thin tree.\n\nAn elderly woman makes the sign of the cross before slowly kneeling down and placing a single flower. Above her, a teddy bear is attached to the fencing of the football pitch, near the empty goal.\n\nDuring the afternoon, a large crowd gathers outside the school. Most are pupils from elsewhere in Belgrade who have come here to pay their respects.\n\nThousands of people, mainly pupils from other Belgrade schools, converged on the school\n\nMother-of-two Sanja Bastic has travelled here with teachers from her own children's school as a sign of solidarity.\n\nShe begins to weep as she explains how her 10-year-old son asked her husband last night what would happen if a shooting happened to them next.\n\n\"My son asked, 'how would you feel if you were having to wait outside the school and I didn't come out?'\n\n\"The kids are sometimes smarter than we are and notice things we don't.\"\n\nSanja believes her country has to look wider than the actions of just one teenager.\n\n\"It's not the kid's fault. It's our fault. This is a combination of things that are happening here. We are a great country with good people and we're welcoming but we have problems here that we need to solve drastically.\"\n\nViolence both online and in real life have to be addressed urgently, she adds.\n\n\"I'm afraid this may be the beginning. We just need to stop it. We have now realised that in our country something like this can happen, and we need to take care of our kids.\"\n\nA teddy bear is a painful reminder that most of the victims of the shooting were children\n\nA short distance from the school, at the Ministry of Education, the woman responsible for preventing violence in classrooms in Serbia tells the BBC that nothing in the suspect's school records showed any sign that he might be capable of such devastating violence.\n\n\"Official information we have about this particular case tell us that nothing suggested something like this will happen,\" says Milja Krivokuca.\n\n\"The most important thing for us to do now is to support everyone, stabilise the situation and then we will go back and look retrospectively to see if something could have been done differently.\"\n\nAt least two unions representing teachers say their members will go on strike tomorrow, demanding better protection for staff and pupils.\n\nPresident Aleksandar Vucic has suggested the age of criminal liability may be lowered from 14 to 12 in the wake of the killings.\n\nMs Krivokuca agrees: \"It is my opinion that it would be desirable to lower the age for criminal responsibility because of one important reason: It is necessary to secure maximum protection [for schools]\".\n\nSerbia should also compare its legislation with neighbours in Europe and further afield, she believes.\n\n\"We might need to see what other countries are doing where legal responsibility starts at 12, and sometimes 10 years old.\"", "Melody Powell has her heart set on a post-pandemic trip to New York\n\nMajor airlines are charging some disabled passengers double to fly from the UK, the BBC has found.\n\nNearly 30 carriers contacted by the BBC said passengers with mobility problems must purchase a full-price ticket for a personal care assistant (PA).\n\nThis is despite Civil Aviation Authority guidance on EU law, maintained by the UK post-Brexit, urging airlines to subsidise the cost.\n\nDisabled people with mobility issues say the situation is discriminatory.\n\nMelody Powell has been saving up to visit friends in New York who kept her company online during years of Covid shielding, but says the extra cost makes flying impossibly expensive.\n\nMelody, 25, uses a wheelchair and needs to fly with a PA to help her reach the toilet and get off the plane. She now has enough money to pay for her own fare - almost \u00a3600 - but is still a long way from being able to afford another full-price ticket.\n\n\"Seeing how much it will cost me to fly because I'm disabled is quite scary,\" she says.\n\nLISTEN: You can hear more about airline charging on the BBC Access All podcast.\n\nRichard Amm is unable to visit his family in South Africa during the festive season or at short notice, when PA tickets can cost \u00a31,500.\n\nWhen his 77-year-old mother broke three ribs recently, flying over was too costly.\n\n\"I would love to visit my mum,\" Richard says. \"But facing double the cost, it just isn't really feasible for me to go.\"\n\nRichard says the cost of a PA ticket means he is unable to visit his family in South Africa at Christmas\n\nThe 40-year-old uses a wheelchair and has trouble lifting his arms, so needs help on long flights.\n\nHe feels the current situation is \"totally discriminatory\" and makes it even harder for disabled people to manage the already high costs of living.\n\n\"Most of us are too poor to even afford a ticket for ourselves,\" Richard says.\n\nAccording to disability charity Scope the average additional monthly cost of being disabled is about \u00a3600 - because of the higher cost of specialist equipment and higher usage of essentials like energy.\n\nBut the employment rate for disabled people is 54%, compared to 82% for non-disabled people.\n\nBBC News contacted more than 100 airlines, including all that fly from Heathrow, to find out how many insist on a PA and whether they offer a discount.\n\nBritish Airways told the BBC that it provided discounted PA fares on direct flights to Brazil and US, but refused to specify by how much. US law allows for subsidised tickets, but only if the airline believes a PA is necessary for safety reasons and the individual does not.\n\nBut in reality, the BBC has been told, this excludes the majority of disabled passengers as it is extremely rare for the clause to be activated - as most people who are told they need a PA already accept that they do.\n\nBeing told by airlines to travel with, and pay for, a PA is a common frustration for disabled passengers, says Josh Wintersgill, a wheelchair user and entrepreneur who is trying to improve aviation accessibility.\n\n\"With many not requiring companions, being forced to travel with someone feels very undermining and incurs additional costs. This is significantly unfair and borderline discriminatory,\" he says.\n\nHe says there is a need for \"drastic international collaboration\" to improve \"outdated and ineffective regulations and guidelines\".\n\nEuropean aviation regulations, maintained by the UK post-Brexit, explicitly advise airlines to offer discounts for passengers who require an escort, but they are advisory only, and cannot be enforced.\n\nThe CAA, which regulates UK aviation policy set by the Department of Transport, also recommends free or discounted PA tickets, but again lacks the power to impose them. The CAA's chief, Anne Bowles, told the BBC that while there was no legal requirement for airlines to offer free or discounted seats to an accompanying person, \"our view is that it is best practice for airlines to do so\".\n\nAdopting these recommendations would bring the aviation sector in line with travelcard schemes across the UK that provide free or discounted travel to disabled people - and sometimes their carers - on buses, trains and taxis. Similar PA concessions also apply at ticketed events.\n\nMelody is frustrated that there is no obligation for airlines to offer discounted fares.\n\n\"When it comes to any sort of legislation that's meant to help disabled people, it's never a legally binding thing,\" she says. \"It's always 'a suggestion' that people conveniently forget exists.\"\n\nAirlines and airports are required to provide disabled passengers with assistance to the plane free of charge, including help to board and disembark the aircraft, in line with anti-discrimination commitments.\n\nHowever, during the flight itself, airline staff are not expected to help disabled passengers access the toilet or evacuate the aircraft.\n\nThis is because airlines are not considered service providers under the UK Equality Act, leaving few legal options to challenge disability discrimination in air travel.\n\nAirlines are only required to follow the Montreal Convention, a set of rules which limit responsibility to personal injury or loss and damage of baggage.\n\nCampaigner Chris Wood said more legislation was needed because the current advice was just \"guidance, not the law\".\n\nWhat the rules should be and what we want are \"two different things\", he told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme, suggesting that airlines should show \"a little bit of empathy\".\n\nThe founder of Flying Disabled added that some airlines are \"great\", but they all \"need guidance\".\n\nAirlines and airports are required to help disabled passengers on and off planes free of charge\n\nLast year the government conducted an aviation consultation that addressed accessibility for disabled passengers but, like its aviation passenger charter, it did not specifically address additional ticket costs for PAs.\n\nWhen asked by the BBC over the widespread failure of airlines to adopt recommendations to subsidise PA fares, the Department for Transport said it was \"committed to ensuring\" accessible air travel but did not address the additional ticket charges.\n\nEnforcing global disability rights in air travel is a challenge because there is no collective means of imposing obligations internationally.\n\nFor example, when a 2019 lawsuit in Canada found that requiring obese passengers and those with a disability to purchase two seats was discriminatory, the country's airlines began to subsidise PA tickets - but for domestic flights only.\n\nLegal experts have told the BBC that the most probable path for change is for a bloc of countries, such as the EU, to impose a member-wide standard that might then become a global norm. Post-Brexit, the UK's position would require its own unique commitments.\n\nA host of failings have been highlighted by the disabled community in recent years. These include being left on planes or at terminals for a long time when waiting for assistance, difficulties accessing the toilet and wheelchairs being lost or damaged.\n\nRather than face the additional costs and challenges of flying as a disabled passenger, many avoid it.\n\nBen Iles, 44, likes to travel but has flown just twice in the past 20 years, having had bad experiences getting on and off planes - he now prefers to use a van that is adapted to his wheelchair.\n\n\"I have everything I need,\" he says.\n\nBut there are some signs of progress for disabled and less mobile travellers - the Department for Transport said last month that it planned to give the CAA the power to fine airlines for breaching consumer laws.\n\nThis includes removing the reimbursement cap for damaged wheelchairs, which are currently treated like regular luggage and valued by weight, not price.\n\nThe CAA has also suggested a ranking to provide transparency about the disability performance of different airlines.\n\nIn response to the BBC's findings, Airlines UK, the industry trade body, said its airlines held a \"proven track record\" of constructive engagement on disability issues and would continue to be supportive of any initiative that improved quality and access to air travel.\n\nDo you have a similar story to the passengers in this article?

Just two years later, he became BBC Wales's parliamentary correspondent.\n\nBy the early 1990s he was the BBC's chief political correspondent at Westminster.\n\nHe became a regular face on the BBC News channel, then called BBC News 24, after it launched in 1997.\n\nEdwards became one of the main anchors on the Six O'Clock News in 1999\n\nIn its early days, the channel was plagued by technical difficulties, but Edwards' confident and level-headed performance in challenging circumstances was said to have impressed BBC bosses.\n\nAround the same time, Edwards was working as an occasional cover presenter on BBC One's Six O'Clock News, one of the most-viewed television news bulletins in the UK, becoming one of the programme's main anchors in 1999.\n\nFour years later, he was promoted to the Ten O'Clock News, widely seen as the BBC's flagship bulletin, and was increasingly asked to present and commentate on major national events for the BBC.\n\nThey included the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (as they were known at the time) in 2011, the funeral of the Duke of Edinburgh (2021), the Queen's Diamond and Platinum Jubilee (2012 and 2022) and the coronation of King Charles (2023).\n\nHe was also on air when Nelson Mandela died in 2013, and co-hosted the results of the Brexit referendum in 2016.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest single moment in Edwards' long presenting career came last September, when he announced the death of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nHe had started his shift early that day following rumours of the Queen's declining health, presenting rolling news coverage from 14:00 before confirming the Monarch's death to the nation that evening while wearing a black tie.\n\nHe went on to front coverage of the late Queen's funeral. He was widely praised by viewers, and the coverage won Edwards and his colleagues a TRIC award, presented last month.\n\nEdwards has presented the flagship News at Ten bulletin for the last 20 years\n\nAs well as major royal events, Edwards had recently become the face of the BBC's general election coverage.\n\nThe Welsh broadcaster was one of the BBC's top earners. In 2017, the first year the BBC was compelled by Parliament to publish the salaries of its star presenters, it was revealed Edwards made \u00a3550,000.\n\nFollowing a flurry of negative headlines about the amount of money the BBC spent on top talent, and the disparity between some of its male and female stars, Edwards took a pay cut, and six years later his salary stands at \u00a3435,000.\n\nEdwards made a cameo appearance as himself in the 2012 James Bond film Skyfall, presenting a BBC News report on a fictionalised attack on the British intelligence service MI6.\n\nIn an interview with BBC Radio Cymru in 2021, Edwards indicated he may not have many years left as the corporation's chief news anchor due to the demands of the role.\n\n\"The nightly news business, after 20 years, that can be taxing, even though I still enjoy the job,\" he said. \"But I don't think I'll be doing that for long\u2026 I think it's fair for the viewers to get a change.\"\n\nEdwards was named as the BBC presenter by his wife Vicky Flind on Wednesday\n\nIn the same year, Edwards made a Welsh-language documentary about his career, during which he revealed he had suffered bouts of depression over 20 years, and had been left \"bedridden\" by his struggle with his mental health.\n\nBut after a distinguished career at the BBC, there are now serious questions about Edwards' career.\n\nAfter the Sun published allegations on Friday that an unnamed BBC presenter had paid large sums of money for explicit images of an individual, there were days of speculation about who the presenter might be.\n\nOver the following days, the Sun, and later BBC News, released further allegations, keeping the story in the headlines.\n\nFinally, on Wednesday, his wife Vicky Flind confirmed Edwards' identity on his behalf, saying she was doing so \"primarily out of concern for his mental well-being\" and to protect their five children.\n\n\"Huw is suffering from serious mental health issues,\" she said. \"The events of the last few days have greatly worsened matters, he has suffered another serious episode and is now receiving in-patient hospital care where he'll stay for the foreseeable future.\"\n\n\"Once well enough to do so, he intends to respond to the stories that have been published.\"", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Mr Macron and his team celebrated there following his 2017 election victory.\n\nEarlier, striking railway workers stormed the former headquarters of Credit Lyonnais bank, which now houses the BlackRock investment company and other firms.\n\nProtesters forced their way into the central Paris building that houses BlackRock, chanting and setting off fireworks\n\nFrance's interior ministry estimated 570,000 people took part in Thursday's strikes, although French unions claimed the number was far higher, at nearly two million.\n\nThe unions have called for new strikes and protests on 13 April - a day before the ruling on the reform.\n\nThough the protests have been largely peaceful, there has been an element of violence since the government in March decided to force the legislation through the lower house of parliament - where it lacks an absolute majority - without a vote.\n\nMr Macron has defended the move, saying the reform is a necessity.", "Russia has repeatedly attacked the Ukrainian port city of Odesa in the days since it withdrew from the grain deal\n\nA short life, with its flaws, but the only diplomatic light in the darkness of Russia's invasion.\n\nIt had allowed Ukraine to export its grain to the world through the Black Sea.\n\nA third less than normal, but still 33 million tonnes. However, in recent months, its health had deteriorated.\n\nRussia was accused of slowing the route with naval blockades and long inspections, and the deal finally succumbed.\n\nLast week saw Moscow's official withdrawal. Russia then launched a wave of missile strikes on ports it once promised to leave alone.\n\nEXPLAINED: What was the Ukraine grain deal?\n\nOne site destroyed was a grain terminal owned by one of Ukraine's biggest producers, Kernel. Officials say more than 60,000 tonnes of grain has been destroyed in the past week.\n\n\"We stopped our exports for the first two to three months of the war,\" explains Yevhen Osypov, Kernel's CEO.\n\n\"The prices of oil and grain went up by 50%, and you can see the same happening again now.\"\n\nWhile global grain supplies seem to be stable for now, global markets saw the price of grain rise by 8% within a day of Russia pulling out - the highest daily rise since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February last year.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin now says his country \"is capable of replacing the Ukrainian grain both on a commercial and free-of-charge basis, especially as we expect another record harvest this year\".\n\nIn an article published on the Kremlin's website ahead of this week's Russia-Africa summit, President Putin wrote that \"Russia will continue its energetic efforts to provide supplies of grain, food products, fertilisers and other goods to Africa\".\n\nBoth Russia and Ukraine are among the world's leading grain exporters.\n\nAt the weekend Russian missile strikes severely damaged Odesa's Transfiguration Cathedral, in the city's Unesco world heritage-listed historic centre\n\nThe Kremlin had earlier agreed not to target port infrastructure in three locations in the region, but that diplomatic shield is no more.\n\nWith damaged ports, no agreed corridor through the Black Sea and Russia controlling most of the coastline, Mr Osypov believes Ukraine's grain export capacity will drop by a further 50%.\n\n\"It's a huge challenge for our farmers because they'll have to sell their products 20% below cost,\" says Mr Osypov, who predicts there will be fewer people in the future working less land.\n\nThe death of the grain deal extends well beyond Odesa's ports. The city's mayor Gennady Trukhanov thinks Moscow just wants to show nothing will be exported without them, and he's right.\n\n\"The most terrible thing is that in order to achieve their goal, they've attacked innocent people,\" he says.\n\nUkraine is known as Europe's breadbasket because of the vast amount of grain it produces\n\nYou're left in little doubt over the scale of Ukrainian grain production when standing 40 metres high on top of a silo in the central Poltava region.\n\nThe plant we're in can hold 120,000 tonnes. It's around a third full, and while Ukraine is unable to export through the Black Sea, it will keep filling up.\n\nThe site is surrounded by an endless agricultural expanse.\n\nThis is a country which can't suddenly stop producing grain. It has to go somewhere - or at least that's the hope.\n\n\"We feel there is a need for us to harvest as much grain as possible,\" says Yulia, a lab technician at Kernel, as she pours samples into a pipe.\n\nBefore the birth of the grain deal, tens of millions of people from some of the world's poorest countries were at risk of starvation because of Ukraine's inability to export it.\n\nTwelve months later, that risk has returned.\n\n\"The Russians probably don't understand what hunger is,\" says Yulia. \"People are starving, there's a large supply, but they can't get it for no reason.\"\n\nLab technicians like Yulia test Ukraine's grain once it has been harvested\n\nMoscow had threatened to pull out before, mainly saying there were too many restrictions on its own agricultural goods.\n\nIt also wants a major bank let into a global payment system, restrictions lifted on Russian fertiliser companies, and for its ships to get full access to insurance and foreign ports.\n\nPresident Putin has now turned those complaints into demands. However, if they were to be met, that would require a relaxation of western sanctions, which is hard to imagine.\n\nLast July, the Kremlin had seemed keen to be \"part of the solution\" when it came to the food crisis that it has directly caused by invading Ukraine.\n\nBattlefield frustrations seem to have changed that stance.\n\nDespite the lack of a pulse, Turkey - one of the main brokers of the grain deal along with the United Nations - is still hopeful it can be resuscitated.\n\nThe UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres (left) and Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan helped broker the grain deal in 2022\n\nSo, assuming the initiative is indeed dead, is there an heir apparent? An alternative solution for Ukraine to export?\n\nRoad and rail has been used through neighbouring countries like Romania and Poland, but there have been times when Ukrainian grain has flooded their markets and driven down prices, to the annoyance of farmers.\n\nThe River Danube has also been developed as a route through central Europe, with two million tonnes of grain making it through in the last 12 months, compared with 600,000 the year before.\n\nHowever both scratch the surface of what Ukraine hopes to shift, and are much more expensive logistically.\n\nDuring her recent visit I asked the head of US Aid, Samantha Power, whether Ukraine's status as \"Europe's breadbasket\" was a thing of the past.\n\nShe'd just announced a package worth almost a billion dollars for Ukraine, which included agricultural modernisation.\n\n\"We're doing what we can, but there's no substitute for peace,\" was her reply.", "The stepfather of a five-year-old girl has pleaded guilty to her murder.\n\nNadia Zofia Kalinowska died after being found injured at her family home at Fernagh Drive in Newtownabbey in December 2019.\n\nHer mother, 28 year-old Aleksandra Wahab, and the child's stepfather, 34-year-old Abdul Wahab, went on trial on Wednesday at Belfast Crown Court, accused of murder.\n\nWhen the case resumed on Thursday, Abdul Wahab pleaded guilty to murder.\n\nThe Pakistani national also pleaded guilty to two charges of grievous bodily harm with intent 24 hours before the child's death and on other occasions between July and December that year.\n\nA minimum period, before he can be released, will be set at a future date.\n\nThe trial had been told the schoolgirl was tortured and killed in her home - a place where she should have felt safe.\n\nDuring the opening, Crown barrister Liam McCollum detailed the injuries inflicted on Nadia.\n\nAs well as suffering a skull fracture and lacerated liver which caused her death, Nadia had sustained fractures and re-fractures to her ribs, a fractured collarbone, a fractured pelvis and an injury to her bowel.\n\nAlso present at Nadia's time of death were 70 surface injuries including bruising and abrasions.\n\nNadia was rushed to hospital from her home in Newtownabbey\n\nThis led the Crown to conclude that Nadia had been subjected to a campaign of physical abuse in the family home which culminated in her death.\n\nAs the hearing was due to resume on Thursday, barristers for both Mr and Mrs Wahab asked that their clients be re-arraigned.\n\nAt this point Abdul Wahab bowed his head and tearfully pleaded guilty to the murder.\n\nAleksandra Wahab pleaded guilty to allowing the death of a child and allowing a child to suffer serious physical harm.\n\nThese pleas were accepted by the court and the jury was discharged.\n\nShe was remanded back into custody.\n\nAddressing the jury of seven men and five woman, the judge said that as both defendants had now pleaded guilty to three charges each, he directed them to return not guilty verdicts on all the remaining counts.\n\nA spokesperson for the school said: \"Our school community is still in shock at this terrible tragedy. We have lost Nadia who was a much loved pupil.\n\n\"Our thoughts and prayers are with those impacted at this time.\"", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. China \"represents a challenge to the world order\", the PM says.\n\nChina \"represents a challenge to the world order\" which the UK must take seriously, Rishi Sunak has said.\n\nThe prime minister told the BBC he was increasing funding for the armed forces because \"the world has become more volatile\" and \"threats to our security have increased\".\n\nDefence spending will rise by nearly \u00a35bn over the next two years.\n\nBut No 10 has given no timeframe for a longer term ambition to boost spending to 2.5% of national income.\n\nMr Sunak was speaking in California, where he held talks with his US and Australian counterparts to agree details of a UK-US pact to supply Australia with nuclear-powered submarines.\n\nThe agreement, known as the Aukus pact, was signed in 2021 as part of a joint effort to counter Chinese military power in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nMr Sunak said in a press conference to mark the pact that the Aukus partnership would deliver \"one of the most advanced\" submarines \"the world has ever known\", creating thousands of jobs in British shipyards.\n\nThe new SSN-Aukus submarines will also be used by the UK, and will be in operation for the Royal Navy by the late 2030s under the plan.\n\nThe boats will replace the UK's seven Astute-class subs.\n\nThe UK's submarines will mainly be built by BAE Systems at Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, and Rolls-Royce, with the US sharing sensitive technology for the project.\n\nAustralia's boats will be built in South Australia, using some components manufactured in the UK, and will be in service in the early 2040s.\n\nMr Sunak said: \"The Aukus partnership, and the submarines we are building in British shipyards, are a tangible demonstration of our commitment to global security.\n\n\"This partnership was founded on the bedrock of our shared values and resolute focus on upholding stability in the Indo-Pacific and beyond.\"\n\nEarlier, in an interview with the BBC's Chris Mason, Mr Sunak said: \"China is a country with fundamentally different values to ours and it represents a challenge to the world order.\n\n\"And that's why it's right that we are alert to that and take steps to protect ourselves\u2026 stand up for our values and protect our interests.\"\n\nHe said the government took the \"challenge\" posed by China seriously, adding that the UK had taken action including blocking Chinese investment in sensitive sectors like semiconductors.\n\nPressed on whether the ambition to increase defence spending to 2.5% of national income was meaningless without a timeframe, the prime minister said the government should be judged \"on our actions\".\n\nAs chancellor, Mr Sunak said he had overseen the largest uplift in defence spending since the end of the Cold War and the government had increased spending every year since then.\n\n\"We're one of the largest spenders on defence anywhere in the world, the largest in Europe, and that will continue to remain the case,\" he added.\n\nHowever, Labour pointed out that defence spending had not hit 2.5% of GDP since it left government in 2010. The UK currently aims to spend 2% of GDP on defence each year, latest figures show.\n\nShadow foreign secretary David Lammy described the ambition as \"another hollow promise\", with \"no plan and no timetable\".\n\nSome Tory MPs have also expressed concern about the level of investment in the armed forces.\n\nTobias Ellwood, who is chairman of the Commons Defence Committee, said the UK was on a \"peacetime budget\" as the world was \"sliding towards a new Cold War\".\n\nWhile Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has publicly welcomed the extra \u00a35bn announced by the prime minister, he had been hoping for considerably more.\n\nThere had been reports - denied by Mr Wallace - that he had threatened to resign if he did not get a commitment to increase defence spending to 3% of GDP by 2030.\n\nMr Wallace told the Commons he was \"not interested\" in resigning, although he added that he was worried about the increased threats facing the UK and long-term investment was needed.\n\nHulking floating airports, aircraft carriers, dominate the shoreline on the Pacific Coast of the United States, where there is a gathering of what's known as the Aukus pact: Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom, keeping a collectively nervous eye on an increasingly muscular China.\n\nPrivately, the government is stark in its assessments.\n\nWestern democracies are comparatively and collectively weaker economically as China grows; Beijing can use every instrument of the state as a tool of foreign policy in a way that's impossible in an open democracy.\n\nAll the data make us more concerned, not less, as one senior figure put it. The review of foreign and defence policy, which has just been published, says the UK is committed to \"swift and robust action\" to counter any threat to UK national interests from China.\n\nMr Sunak was also asked whether Chinese-owned social media app TikTok should be banned on all government phones.\n\nIt comes after the Sunday Times reported experts at GCHQ's National Cyber Security Centre had identified risks to sensitive information from the app and could issue advice to ministers and civil servants.\n\nThe prime minister refused to comment directly but said \"we take the security of devices seriously and we look also at what our allies are doing\".\n\nThe US government and the European Commission have already taken steps to ban TikTok on the phones of staff members.\n\nThe government has set out its plans for foreign and defence policy in an new version of the so-called Integrated Review.\n\nThe update was ordered by then-Prime Minister Liz Truss in September last year to take account of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe review identified Russia as \"the most pressing national security and foreign policy priority in the short-to-medium term\".\n\nBut it also describes China under Communist Party rule as an \"epoch-defining and systemic challenge... across almost every aspect of national life and government policy\".\n\nIt says the government will engage \"constructively\" with Beijing on shared priorities but where the Chinese government's actions threaten the UK's interests \"we will take swift and robust action to protect them\".\n\nFormer Conservative leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith, who is among the Tory MPs calling for the government to take a tougher line on China, said he was \"confused\" about what the government's position was.\n\n\"Does that now mean that China is a threat or an epoch-defining challenge or a challenging government epoch or none of that?\" he asked in the Commons.\n\nMr Lammy said the updated review was \"overdue\" but welcome.\n\n\"The initiative to improve understanding of China in government is vital, particularly given the Foreign Office has only been training 14 people a year to speak fluent Mandarin,\" he added.", "Chris Heaton-Harris spoke to the media after meeting the main Stormont parties\n\nThe secretary of state has hit back at accusations that he had set out a \"punishment budget\".\n\nHe was responding to claims from the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) that it was \"wrong for people to punish people of Northern Ireland\".\n\nThe secretary of state said Stormont can repay a \u00a3300m budget overspend across two years rather than one.\n\nRepaying the 2022-23 overspend over a longer period will \"provide some protection to frontline public services\", he said.\n\nBut he added departments still faced difficult decisions \"in order to live within the funding available\".\n\nStormont officials have been planning for budget cuts of at least \u00a3500m in cash terms in this financial year - most Stormont departments will have their budgets cut in cash terms.\n\n\"The purpose was not to punish anybody with this budget - it's to make sure services can continue in the absence of devolved government,\" said Mr Heaton-Harris.\n\nAsked what else he could offer the DUP given that its stance on re-entering Stormont has not changed, he replied: \"Let's see where talks lead to.\"\n\nDUP Leader Jeffrey Donaldson said his party had \"real concerns about the lack of allocations within the budget for pay awards\".\n\n\"There are major challenges here and we are concerned about the way the Northern Ireland Office is handling things,\" he said.\n\n\"This is what the secretary of state described as a flat budget.\n\n\"Of course I want to see Stormont back up and running but it needs to be on a stable foundation.\"\n\nHe said going back to Stormont was not a \"quick fix\".\n\nThe Department of Health, the largest department, is receiving an allocation of \u00a37.25bn for day-to-day spending - similar to the amount it got last year.\n\nThis \"flat cash\" funding will likely be viewed as a difficult settlement for the department, given the current high rate of inflation and outstanding pay demands.\n\nCompared with last year's budget figures the amount of money going to Education, Justice and Economy - the biggest spending departments - has been cut slightly in cash terms.\n\nEducation will get \u00a32.57bn, down from \u00a32.64bn, Justice will get \u00a31.12bn, down from \u00a31.14bn, while Economy will get \u00a3772m, down from \u00a3780m.\n\nThis budget could have been worse. But make no mistake, it is still likely to mean deteriorating public services for NI citizens.\n\nThe blow has been softened a little by allowing last year's \u00a3300m overspend to be repaid over two years instead of one.\n\nThe repayments will be drawn from any new money sent from Westminster later this year rather than being immediately chopped from departmental funds.\n\nBut that will present a significant challenge to the senior civil servants currently running Stormont.\n\nThere is an expectation that the UK government will eventually provide extra money to settle public sector pay disputes in England.\n\nThat will automatically mean extra funding for Stormont.\n\nBut that raises the prospect that the senior officials will then have to tell their workforces that they will not get a pay deal to match England because the overspend comes first.\n\nThat is not a recipe for industrial peace.\n\nRead more from John here.\n\nMr Heaton-Harris said the overspend would be cleared by using any additional in-year funding from the Treasury.\n\nShould this not cover the full amount, the outstanding balance would be paid in 2024-25 by reallocating money from previously announced Northern Ireland funding packages.\n\nIt is understood that the possibility of drawing on a funding stream known as financial transactions capital (FTC) is being considered.\n\nThis is a conditional form of capital funding which Stormont consistently underspends.\n\nThe Treasury would have to agree that FTC could be used in this way.\n\nNo new money-raising policies, such as water charges, were advanced by the Northern Ireland secretary.\n\nHe repeated that lower levels of revenue generation but higher public-service provision in Northern Ireland compared to the rest of the UK was \"unsustainable\".\n\nNew legislation to allow the UK government to explore options for increasing budget sustainability has also been introduced.\n\nIt will work with the Northern Ireland Civil Service to review areas for further revenue raising.\n\nIn Belfast on Wednesday people protested against budget cuts\n\nStormont can expect more money if the UK government allocates new funding to settle public sector pay deals in England.\n\nBut if that money must be used to reduce the overspend, it could be very difficult for senior officials to offer similar pay deals to public servants in Northern Ireland unless savings are found in other areas.\n\nUlster University economist Esmond Birney said the budget presented a tough challenge for the Stormont departments.\n\nHe described allowing the overspend to be paid down over two years as being the least worst option, compared to doing it immediately which \"would have implied very large spending cuts in this year\".\n\nOn Wednesday the head of Stormont's civil service, Jayne Brady, warned that the \"damage\" caused by the proposed budget reductions would be unprecedented.\n\nWriting to Mr Heaton-Harris's office, she outlined her \"profound concern\" about senior civil servants being placed in \"harmful decision-making positions\" about which services should be cut.\n\nIt was a rare and significant intervention, and one not typically made by senior civil servants.\n\nRetail NI Chief Executive Glyn Roberts said the budget would be \"brutal for public services\".\n\nHe said civil servants would be put in an \"incredibly difficult position when deciding on how to apply severe cuts\".\n\nHe called for a restored executive and a review of how Northern Ireland is financed.\n\nThe secretary of state hosted round table talks with parties in Northern Ireland\n\nThe Stormont political parties met Mr Heaton-Harris on Thursday afternoon about the budget.\n\nThey are not in government due to the Democratic Unionist Party's (DUP) boycott of Stormont, which began in February 2022.\n\nSinn F\u00e9in's former Finance Minister Conor Murphy said the budget would devastate public services.\n\n\"The absence of an executive is really reprehensible at this stage when this is the outcome for people we represent,\" he said.\n\nUlster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie said the budget did not contain \"any flexibility\".\n\n\"It's quite grim, if I'm really honest, but it's been put to us and it's difficult to do anything without a government up and running,\" he said.\n\nAlliance Party assembly member Andrew Muir described the discussions as \"grim and truly bleak\".\n\nHe expressed concern that it would be left to civil servants to take decisions about cuts and said that was \"entirely wrong\".\n\nSocial Democratic and Labour Party assembly member Matthew O'Toole described the meeting with Mr Heaton-Harris as concerning.\n\nHe said the budget would mean \"a real squeeze on public services\" imposed on people in Northern Ireland that they did not deserve, ask or vote for.\n\nPermanent secretaries - top civil servants - have been running Northern Ireland's nine departments since October but their powers are severely limited.\n\nThey can only implement policies previously agreed by politicians and their ability to react to changing circumstances is negligible.\n\nDepartments have been operating without proper budgets since the start of the financial year in April.", "The pub closed on 1 May and Mrs Ryley told a local news website \"I've had enough\"\n\nTwo former pub managers have given a voluntary interview to Essex Police after their collection of golly dolls was seized by the force.\n\nFive officers removed the offensive dolls from the White Hart Inn in Grays, which has since shut down, following a hate crime allegation.\n\nEssex Police was waiting for landlord Chris Ryley to return from abroad and it confirmed he and wife Benice Ryley were spoken to on Thursday.\n\nA police spokesperson said: \"Two people, a man and woman, have been interviewed voluntarily as part of our investigation.\n\nThe police seized the dolls from behind the bar on 4 April and the Campaign for Real Ale removed the pub from its Good Beer Guide the following week.\n\nMrs Ryley said at the time she had displayed the collection, donated by her late aunt and customers, for nearly 10 years.\n\nThe building was vandalised with white paint and had its windows damaged on 16 April -

The qualities Sue Gray has largely been associated with - professionalism, propriety and public service - are exactly those they want to project.\n\nAnd it sends a sign about the party's intentions - Keir Starmer wants to work closely with someone who was (until very recently) a senior civil servant, because he intends to make it to 10 Downing Street.\n\nBassetlaw MP Brendan Clarke-Smith said he was \"genuinely shocked\", and accused Sir Keir of having \"scant regard for the public image of the civil service and the damage this will do\".\n\n\"After the events of last year, people will quite understandably be questioning the appropriateness of this appointment, including issues of impartiality,\" he added.\n\nFormer civil servant Alex Thomas, who now works for the Institute for Government think tank, said the move would be \"difficult for the civil service\", giving its \"critics a stick\".\n\n\"Tricky development for those defending impartiality,\" he added.", "Sir Keir Starmer said politicians writing books about Covid and leaking messages was \u201cinsulting\u201d and a \u201cghoulish spectacle\u201d.\n\nHe was referencing newspaper claims of leaked messages about former Health Secretary Matt Hancock.\n\nRishi Sunak paid tribute to health workers, adding the Covid inquiry should do its work rather than him commenting on \"piecemeal bits of information\".\n\nA spokesman for Mr Hancock has said the messages had been \"doctored\" to create a false story which is \"flat wrong\".", "Front line staff vacancies account for 75% of those cut\n\nMore than 600 vacancies at the Department for Communities (DfC) - including those for front line staff - will not be filled, it has been confirmed.\n\nThe decision means there is a risk of slowing down the delivery of benefits for those in need.\n\nThe DfC is responsible for benefits, housing, addressing homelessness, arts and culture and sport.\n\nFrontline staff vacancies account for 75% of those cut.\n\nThe department said the cuts would be made in order to live within an \"inadequate\" budget.\n\nArm's length bodies of the DfC and third-party organisations funded by the department will receive a 5% cut to their budgets.\n\nThese include the Arts Council, Libraries NI and the Northern Ireland Housing Executive among others.\n\nCouncils will receive a \u00a34m cut to the Rates Support Grant compared to the previous year, which will affect seven of Northern Ireland's 11 councils.\n\nThe department has also decided to leave four offices in the greater Belfast area.\n\nNone of the offices are public facing, meaning services will not be impacted.\n\nThe DfC is the largest department in the Northern Ireland Civil Service with more than 9,000 staff.\n\nIn taking these decisions, the department said it would be \u00a310m over budget, understood to be a calculated risk which is expected to be managed throughout the year.\n\nConfirming the funding decisions, DfC permanent secretary Colum Boyle said the department had \"sought to mitigate the significant and adverse impact\" of the budget, which he described as \"sub-optimal\".\n\n\"Our shared priority remains supporting the most vulnerable and at-risk in our society,\" he said.\n\n\"However, difficult decisions had to be made to live within the funding available.\"\n\nFunding for homelessness is set to be increased by \u00a32m\n\nThe Supporting People programme which helps people live independently in the community has had funding sustained at the same as last year's level.\n\nDiscretionary support, which provides emergency financial support for people in crisis situation, will receive \u00a320m funding.\n\nLast year, \u00a340m of discretionary support grants were handed out after significant demand due to the cost of living crisis.\n\nFunding for homelessness is to be increased by \u00a32m (or 8%) compared to last year.\n\nThe Affordable Warmth Scheme and Neighbourhood Renewal programmes have also been protected.\n\nIn terms of the capital budget, the DfC is facing a \u00a359m (27%) shortfall compared to what was asked for, against a backdrop of record inflation in areas such as construction.\n\nThis mean's the budget will not be able to meet the department's target to start 2,000 new social homes this year and is now only expected to achieve 1,470 new starts.", "This has, broadly, been a debate focused on policy rather than personality - something summed up when Humza Yousaf said he was \"not going to sit here and slag off colleagues in government\".\n\nHe did clash with Kate Forbes over her approach to business, but that was teed up by the audience more than the candidates themselves.\n\nWhen given the chance, the trio have not sought to land punches on each other. The cross-examination portion of the debate was notably less fiery than in previous events.\n\nThat may be in part because yellow-on-yellow attacks are greeted with glee by opposition parties, but it is also a mark of how the candidates have developed their approach.\n\nRather than seeking to savage Humza Yousaf in the cross-examination section, this time Kate Forbes asked policy-laden questions which promoted her own strengths on economic issues.\n\nAsh Regan brought up gender reform - again, something she sees as a strength of her own campaign.\n\nHumza Yousaf was actually ticked off by Stephen Jardine for talking about his own policies at length when he was meant to be questioning Kate Forbes.\n\nThis may be because of the fear that mud thrown now could still be stuck when future elections roll around.\n\nBut it may also be because this race uses a single transferable vote system \u2013 and in a tight contest, second-preference votes could turn out to be crucial.\n\nIt may be more profitable to make friends than to try to knock out opponents entirely.", "President Zelensky followed into a press conference by Poland's President Duda and Lithuania's President Nauseda Image caption: President Zelensky followed into a press conference by Poland's President Duda and Lithuania's President Nauseda\n\nAway from the scene in Kramatorsk, the Polish and Lithuanian presidents are in Kyiv to meet their Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky.

Watch: I'm resigning, this is a distraction for the BBC - BBC chairman\n\nBBC chairman Richard Sharp has resigned after breaking rules over dealings with Boris Johnson ahead of his appointment.\n\nA report found Mr Sharp created the appearance of a conflict of interest by not fully disclosing his knowledge of the ex-PM's personal finances.\n\nHis position was scrutinised after it emerged he tried to secure a high-level government meeting for a businessman offering Mr Johnson financial help.\n\nMr Sharp defended his conduct but said he did not want to be a distraction.\n\nA critical report led by barrister Adam Heppinstall was published on Friday, after months of speculation about Mr Sharp's position and a row about BBC independence.\n\nThe probe was set up after reports in the Sunday Times revealed Mr Sharp, a close associate of Mr Johnson, had played some role in the PM's personal finances at the same time as he was seeking to secure the senior BBC job.\n\nIn late 2020, Mr Sharp sought to arrange a meeting between Cabinet Secretary Simon Case and Sam Blyth, a distant cousin of Mr Johnson who had offered to support the PM financially, after reading press claims he was struggling to make ends meet.\n\nThe ex-investment banker and Conservative Party donor had already applied for the senior BBC job when he approached Mr Case and was appointed a few months later.\n\nThe report found he had failed to disclose two potential perceived conflicts of interest: first, by telling Mr Johnson he wanted to apply for the BBC role before doing so; and second, by telling the PM he intended to set up a meeting between Mr Case, the country's most senior civil servant, and Mr Blyth.\n\nIt notes that Mr Sharp does not accept the first conclusion, but he has apologised for the second, though described it as \"inadvertent and not material\".\n\nThe report found \"there is a risk of a perception that Mr Sharp was recommended for appointment\" because he sought to assist the PM in a private financial matter \"and/or that he influenced the former prime minister to recommend him by informing him of his application before he submitted it\".\n\nIt described his involvement in Mr Johnson's private financial affairs as \"very limited\" but concluded that it should have been declared anyway - even though the meeting between Mr Case and Mr Blyth did not subsequently take place.\n\nThe report did not make a judgement \"on whether Mr Sharp had any intention of seeking to influence the former Prime Minister in this manner\".\n\nMr Sharp has previously insisted he believed flagging his BBC application with Mr Case and agreeing to have no further involvement in any loan discussions resolved any conflict of interest issues, and therefore they did not need to be further disclosed - but the report disagreed with his position.\n\nHe said he did not play \"any part whatsoever in the facilitation, arrangement, or financing of a loan for the former prime minister\" but that he was quitting in order to \"prioritise the interests of the BBC\".\n\nMr Sharp conceded that with hindsight he should have disclosed his role in setting up a meeting between Mr Case and Mr Blyth to the appointments panel during the scrutiny process ahead of him taking up the senior role, and he apologised for the \"oversight\".\n\nThe details of who said what to who and when are complicated but there is a simple issue, did Richard Sharp tell the full truth when he applied for the job?\n\nHe says today's independent report makes clear that he didn't and he was in breach of the rules.\n\nThat breach he says was \"inadvertent\" and an \"error\" he regrets - but it matters.\n\nHe is the head of the BBC and its reputation is based on trust. The job description for the BBC Chairman says it is essential that they \"observe high standards of openness and seek to maximise transparency and accountability\".\n\nMPs on the Commons Media Select Committee have already criticised Richard Sharp for a lack of openness and transparency for not revealing his role in a loan guarantee to Boris Johnson. These were, they said, \"serious errors of judgment\".\n\nTheir report added: \"Mr Sharp has accepted that his failure to disclose this involvement has caused embarrassment to him and the BBC and has potentially been misconstrued, both of which are tests on conflicts that the public appointments process specifically requires candidates to consider.\"\n\nIt's probably worth quoting here the exact words from the Cabinet Office's Governance Code: \"If you have any interests that might be relevant to the work of the BBC, and which could lead to a real or perceived conflict of interest if you were to be appointed, please provide details in your application.\"\n\nThe weeks of headlines and the critical conclusions of two reports into his actions have certainly been, in his words, \"a distraction from the Corporation's good work\".\n\nThe report also called for an overhaul of the rules around public appointments, and criticised the leaking of ministers' preferred candidates for senior jobs to the media - pointing out there were reports about Mr Sharp being tipped for the BBC role in newspapers before the process was completed.\n\nMr Sharp's position came under further scrutiny in March following Gary Lineker's suspension over a tweet criticising government asylum policy, a decision which triggered a wider row about BBC impartiality.\n\nCritics of the BBC's handling of the issue contrasted Lineker's suspension with how allegations against Mr Sharp were dealt with, pointing out the chairman was able to remain in post despite ongoing investigations.\n\nLineker tweeted on Friday the BBC chair should \"not be selected by the government of the day... not now, not ever\".\n\nThe BBC chair can only be appointed or sacked by the government. The BBC director general, the executive who has ultimate editorial control over the corporation, does not have the power to remove them.\n\nResponding to the resignation, the BBC's former controller of editorial policy, Richard Ayre, said the matter came down to \"the integrity and transparency\" of Mr Sharp's application and that he \"had to go\".\n\nHe continued: \"Meaningfully or not he had done a favour [for Mr Johnson]. He didn't declare that to the assessment panel.\"\n\nTim Davie, director-general of the BBC, said Mr Sharp had made a \"significant contribution to the transformation and success of the BBC\".\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said he has not seen the report into Mr Sharp and did not guarantee a non-political figure would replace him.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Glasgow, Mr Sunak said: \"There's an appointments process that happens for those appointments. I'm not going to prejudge that.\"\n\nLabour's shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell said: \"The prime minister should have sacked him weeks ago. Instead it took this investigation, called by Labour, to make him resign.\"\n\nMr Sharp will remain in post until a successor is appointed in June.", "Staff sickness in the NHS in England has reached record levels.\n\nFigures for 2022 show an absence rate - the proportion of days lost - of 5.6%, meaning the NHS lost the equivalent of nearly 75,000 staff to illness.\n\nThis is higher than during the peak pandemic years of 2020 and 2021 - and a 29% rise on the 2019 rate.\n\nMental health problems were the most common cause, responsible for nearly a quarter of absences, the Nuffield Trust analysis of official NHS data shows.\n\nBig rises were also seen in cold, coughs, infections and respiratory problems, likely to be linked to the continued circulation of Covid as well as the return of flu last year.\n\nThere were three categories covering these types of illnesses. If combined, they would be responsible for more sickness than mental health.\n\nThe think tank warned the NHS was stuck in a \"seemingly unsustainable cycle\" of increased work and burnout, which was contributing to staff leaving.\n\nThe analysis, exclusively for BBC News, comes ahead of the publication of the government and NHS England's long-awaited workforce plan.\n\nNuffield Trust senior fellow Dr Billy Palmer said: \"The health service is grappling with a difficult new normal when it comes to staff sickness leave.\n\n\"There has been a lot of focus on recruitment but we need more endeavour to improve the working conditions of existing staff and protect them from illness.\n\n\"The workforce plan needs to have concrete support to enable employers to improve NHS staff experience if the service is to break this cycle of staff absences, sickness and leaving rates.\"\n\nThe NHS sickness rate, the highest since records began, in 2010, is above the public sector average of 3.6%.\n\nThe Nuffield Trust warned it was likely to be an undercount of the true figure as not every absence would have been recorded.\n\nAnd while recording systems differed in Wales and Scotland, it was clear those nations were also seeing increased levels of sickness in the NHS.\n\nMiriam Deakin, of NHS Providers, which represents health managers, said the findings \"laid bare the psychological strain on staff\".\n\nShe said the absences came on top of 110,000 vacancies in the health service and warned the situation was having a \"knock-on effect on patient care\".\n\nUnison head of health Sara Gorton said the rise in illness was due to the \"unrelenting pressure\" on the NHS.\n\n\"Until the NHS has sufficient employees to care for and treat all the people needing its help, absence levels will keep going through the roof. If there's to be a healthy NHS, it first needs a healthy workforce.\"\n\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said high rates of Covid at the start of 2022 would have had an influence on the figures.\n\n\"For those staff that need it the NHS provides physical and mental health support - including targeted psychological support and treatment,\" she added.\n\nDo you work for the NHS?

They managed to abscond from the ward and on two occasions took a drugs overdose.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the BBC told the story of 16-year-old Molly who has autism, high levels of anxiety and eating problems.\n\nShe spent nearly seven months in a side room on a children's ward at the Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth, because of a shortage of places that could provide her with the support and therapy she needed.\n\nHer family says she found the noisy environment traumatic. Despite having agency mental health nurses watching her 24 hours a day, she ran Mental health patients 'at risk' in child wardsaway from the hospital once and was able to seriously harm herself on a number of occasions. She was also restrained numerous times.\n\nIn April, her behaviour became so distressed that the children's ward closed to other patients for 10 days. She was then moved to a mental health unit, where she is doing better.\n\nHer local health and care system said it was \"very sorry\" it had not been able to support her in a more suitable environment, when \"she was most vulnerable\".\n\nMolly's story prompted other families to get in touch with the BBC.\n\nJulie's child, who has autism, spent a year in a side room of a children's hospital at the age of 15. The teenager, who does not want their name used, also has eating problems.\n\nJulie says that her child was made to feel at fault, even though \"they hadn't asked to be there\". She says: \"They'd been put there waiting for something that wasn't coming, and how can you... make a vulnerable child feel that they're just a difficulty and a brat.\"\n\nJulie's child who has autism spent a year in the side room of a children's ward\n\nJo-Ann's 15-year-old daughter is being assessed for autism and mental health difficulties. She is currently in the burns unit at a children's hospital. She has no physical problems for them to treat, but was moved there from the paediatric ward of another hospital. She was admitted after trying to harm herself nearly three months ago.\n\n\"She is classed as too vulnerable to go onto a mental health unit,\" Jo-Ann said. \"She has fallen into no man's land.\"\n\nShe said the NHS and council-run children's services are trying to put together the support her daughter needs at home.\n\nOne parent also got in touch describing how terrifying it was for children who were physically very poorly, when there was someone being restrained or who was disruptive on the ward.\n\nIt is a mark of HSIB's significant concern about the situation that it decided to publish this interim report, before it has finished its full investigation.\n\nThe report said paediatric wards contained many self-harm risks, including ligature points, and that they were busy, noisy places which were unsuitable for children experiencing a mental health crisis, or with sensory needs, for instance, because they have autism.\n\nIt found that therapeutic help was limited or non-existent and children deteriorated as a result.\n\nMolly's hospital room - her autism meant she found the noise of the ward traumatic\n\nHSIB said on one paediatric ward there were more than 70 security incidents over three months relating to children with high-risk behaviours. Most involved the young person being physically restrained.\n\n\"In just over half of the security incidents reported, the child or young person had been sedated, sometimes requiring multiple attempts (up to seven) for the sedation to become effective,\" it said.\n\nThe report said on occasions nearly all the paediatric nursing teams on different wards could be involved in trying to support patients whose behaviour was high risk.\n\nStaff told the investigators they were concerned about the \"negative psychological impact\" it was having on other patients and their families.\n\nHSIB said it saw \"vulnerable and unwell children and babies next to or near a young person who was trying to harm themselves and/or whose behaviour could be violent and aggressive\".\n\nThe report says there were many incidents where staff were assaulted, and some hospitals, which were struggling to recruit and retain staff, described their workforce as \"collapsing\".\n\nAn NHS England spokesperson said: \"The NHS will be reviewing the concerns raised by HSIB and will consider them as part of ongoing work to improve care for the record number of children and young people with mental health needs that the NHS is treating.\n\n\"In some circumstances it can be appropriate for young people to receive mental health care in acute settings, such as for treatment of physical health needs, and to support staff in doing this safely there is a clear framework to follow and an online training platform, while several areas are piloting services that better integrate mental and physical health care.\"\n\nHave you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

Everyone else in his troop lay dead or injured.\n\nSuffering from shell-shock and with one arm bandaged, the 37-year-old fired at the waves of Russian soldiers trying to storm his position. They didn't even try to take cover, but simply walked towards him across the open field.\n\nIt was clear Pavel wouldn't be able to hold the position for long, but he needed to buy time for a rescue team to arrive.

A tank began hammering their position.\n\nUnlike relentless mortar rounds, the tank's aiming was chillingly accurate. Shells were landing a few metres from their trenches. Two soldiers were wounded and Pavel told them to go into a dugout. A combat medic went down to tend to their injuries and prepare them for an evacuation. Moments later, the wooden shelter was directly hit by a shell.\n\n\"There was a bright flash,\" one of the wounded soldiers with a callsign Tsygan told the BBC. \"I was thrown onto the logs with such force that it nearly crushed me. I couldn't understand whether I was dead or alive. Someone was shouting, it seemed the sound was coming from 100m away.\"\n\nI couldn't understand whether I was dead or alive\n\nIt was Pavel's voice who was checking on them. The other soldier was half-buried under dirt and logs. He was dead.\n\nTsygan could barely move and Pavel had to drag him up over the splintered logs that blocked the way. It was painfully slow to move Tsygan just a few metres away into a nearby trench. When the shelling paused briefly, Pavel went back trying to find others.\n\nTwo minesweepers arrived to clear the logs and find the bodies. But yet another shell hit the dug out, killing one of the men and injuring the other. The tank kept firing.\n\nAt that moment, Russian troops started storming their position. Pavel called for a support group to evacuate the wounded and rushed back to his Browning machine gun to stop the Russian infantry.\n\nThe 206th Battalion in which Pavel served had fought in the southern Kherson and north-eastern Kharkiv regions. But the battles over Bakhmut were very different from what they had seen before.\n\n\"The intensity of fighting to break through our positions was shocking,\" says Mykola Hlabets, platoon commander. \"Sometimes, [Russian soldiers] would get as close as 20 metres from us, crawling and moving under a treeline or across an open field. This is where we had our first gunfights at such proximity.\"\n\n\"They would just stand and walk towards our positions without any cover. We wiped out one group after another, but they kept coming.\"\n\nHlabets described them as a suicide squad. Others call them cannon fodder.\n\nUkrainians are trying to fight off Russia's human wave attacks - similar to tactics used during World War One\n\nA number of videos have been shared on telegram channels recently where newly mobilized Russian soldiers appealed to President Vladimir Putin and the authorities to stop what they called \"illegal orders\" to send them \"to be slaughtered\".\n\nLast month mobilised soldiers from Belgorod posted a video saying that they were sent for an assault mission without proper training. After suffering heavy losses, they said they refused to carry out their orders.\n\nOften these poorly trained soldiers are reportedly forced to keep pushing forward. The assault group Storm of the 5th Brigade of the Russian army said in a video appeal that they couldn't leave their position because of zagryad otryad, or blocking troops - detachments that open fire at their own men who try to retreat.\n\nThese wave attacks are similar to World War One tactics, when troops charged the enemy and engaged in close combat. And despite their lack of training and experience, sending newly recruited soldiers to such assaults are bringing some results for Russia, albeit at a very high cost.\n\nUkrainians expose their positions when they open fire to stop those attacks. That allows Russian artillery to identify the target and destroy it, as happened with Pavel's post.\n\nAlso, soldiers at forward positions run out of ammunition while trying to repel numerous wave attacks. They then become an easy target.\n\nThat was the risk Pavel knew he faced as he rushed to his Browning machine gun. But as long as he kept firing, his wounded brothers-in-arms had a chance to be rescued.\n\nTsygan was bleeding in the trench where Pavel had left him. Shrapnel had smashed his pelvis. Another piece had gone through his thigh, and a third had hit his abdomen, \"turning the internal organs upside down\", he said. He was barely conscious.\n\n\"I didn't see much, it was all white,\" he said. \"I lay on the snowy ground for two hours and I didn't feel cold or anything.\"\n\nNext to him was another wounded soldier. The rescue team on an armoured personnel carrier hastily picked them up as shelling resumed. They didn't even have time to close the hatch, Tsygan says.\n\nBy that time, Pavel's machine gun had fallen silent. He died from a head wound: a piece of shrapnel had pierced his helmet.\n\nCommanders of the 206th battalion decided to send a group to retrieve the bodies of Pavel and the other soldiers.\n\nThe next day in the evening, three groups of two soldiers each set off to bring the bodies back.\n\n\"The plan looked good on paper, but things quickly went wrong,\" junior sergeant Vasyl Palamarchuk, who was in the lead group, remembers. They got lost and nearly ran into Russian positions in the dark. When they got close to the dugout, Russians spotted them and opened fire from a tank.\n\nPavel Kuzin died holding off Russian attackers so his wounded fellow soldiers could be evacuated\n\nRussian tanks and artillery had continuously shelled that post in those days, but the Ukrainian big guns had largely stayed quiet. The reason was a massive shortage of shells.\n\n\"Once we counted that the Russians had fired up to 60 shells a day, whereas we could allow only two,\" Palamarchuk explains. \"They destroyed trees and everything else and you had no place to hide.\"\n\nUkraine is struggling to find ammunition for its Soviet-era artillery. Getting shells for weapons donated by Ukraine's western partners has its own limits. As the secretary general of the Nato military alliance, Jens Stoltenberg, said recently: \"The current rate of Ukraine's ammunition expenditure is many times higher than our current rate of production.\"\n\nPalamarchuk's group eventually picked up Pavel's body just a few hours before Russian troops seized the area. Heavy snow turned into a freezing rain. After numerous breaks on the way back, crawling through craters left by shells, they finally arrived. The whole operation over just a kilometre's distance lasted for six hours.\n\nIt was past midnight but the entire battalion gathered at the evacuation point to pay their respects to Pavel, who is survived by his daughter and wife.\n\n\"It was a huge loss for our unit,\" Palamarchuk says. \"He saved two people but died himself.\"", "More than a quarter of patients on antidepressants in England - about two million people - have been taking them for five years, the BBC has found.\n\nThis is despite there being limited evidence of the benefits of taking the drugs for that length of time.\n\nA doctor who runs an NHS clinic helping people off the pills says withdrawal symptoms can make it hard for some to stop taking their medication.\n\nWithdrawal guidance was updated in 2019, but he says little has changed.\n\nMore than eight million people in England are on antidepressants - which are prescribed for depression, anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder and other conditions. That's one million more people than five years previously, NHS prescribing figures show.\n\nThe new figures on long-term use - for the period 2018-2022 - were provided to BBC Panorama by the NHS, following a Freedom of Information request. The data gives an overall picture but does not reflect the circumstances of individual patients, some of whom could be on antidepressants long-term for good reason.\n\nThe investigation also uncovered evidence that a leading drug company attempted 27 years ago to conceal possible withdrawal effects that one drug could cause.\n\nModern antidepressants - called SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Re-Uptake Inhibitors) - arrived from the late 1980s, including Prozac. They were quickly heralded as wonder drugs compared with earlier medications, some of which had serious side effects.\n\nThey were thought to treat depression by fixing an imbalance of the mood-regulating chemical serotonin in the brain. Researchers are now not clear how they work. One theory is that they simply change how you think or feel, rather than rectifying an underlying problem.\n\nThe NHS recommends antidepressants as a treatment for more severe depression. Talking therapy as well as exercise and lifestyle changes might be recommended instead of, or in combination with, the medication.\n\n\"Throughout my long and extensive career, I have seen people benefit from antidepressants,\" said Prof Wendy Burn, former president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists.\n\n\"I see them working in my clinical practice, I see lives being changed by them.\"\n\nBut she added: \"People are staying on antidepressants longer, and we don't really have long-term studies that support that.\"\n\nThere has long been a debate about how effective antidepressants are. The most comprehensive research, from the University of Oxford, suggests antidepressants do help some people, at least in the short-term.\n\nBut on average, their benefits are relatively modest, and the way people respond varies, with some not responding at all, according to the researcher who led the study.\n\nAnd there is some evidence to suggest that long-term antidepressant use may be linked to some health risks, such as heart problems and diabetes. It is also thought that long-term use may lead to a higher risk of withdrawal symptoms in some people.\n\nWithdrawal can happen when you stop a drug that your body has become used to.\n\nTaking that drug away too quickly, before the brain has had time to adjust, can lead to symptoms - including low mood and feelings of anxiety. Some symptoms overlap with the original condition the drug was prescribed for, which means the withdrawal can sometimes be confused with relapse.\n\nThe symptoms depend on the individual, which drug they were taking, and for how long. Many patients can stop taking antidepressants without experiencing any problems.\n\nIf you are affected by any of the issues in this article you can find details of organisations that can help via the BBC Action Line\n\nPanorama has uncovered evidence to suggest that one major drug company which manufactured SSRI antidepressants had become increasingly aware of a whole range of withdrawal symptoms from the mid-1990s, but was reluctant to share this information with the public and medicines regulators.\n\nA copy of a confidential 1996 memo from firm Pfizer - which originally sold sertraline, now the UK's most common antidepressant - shows employees discussing what the drug company would tell regulators in Norway.\n\n\"We should not volunteer to describe the withdrawal symptoms, but have an agreed list prepared in case they insist,\" the memo says.\n\nSome of the withdrawal reactions the memo refers to include sensory disturbances, sweating, nausea, insomnia, tremors, agitation and anxiety.\n\nPfizer no longer produces sertraline. Responding to Panorama's findings, a spokesperson said the company \"monitored and reported all adverse event data\" to licensing authorities, \"in line with its legal and regulatory obligations and updated sertraline labelling as required.\"\n\nIt added: \"Public health organisations and professional medical bodies throughout the world have recognised sertraline and other SSRIs as the treatment of choice for adult depression.\" The company said the drug's label warned about withdrawal and had been updated \"as required\".\n\nThe Royal College of Psychiatrists published updated information on withdrawal in 2019 - overseen by Prof Burn, who was its president at the time. It came after she heard testimony from patients who had experienced severe withdrawal effects.\n\nUntil then, guidance used by the NHS and the college maintained withdrawal was mostly mild and short-lived - lasting no more than about a week.\n\nNow NHS guidance reflects that it can be severe and longer-lasting for some, and withdrawal can last many months.\n\nA Royal College of Psychiatrists spokesperson told the BBC: \"Medicine continuously evolves, as does our knowledge of treating mental illness. As a result, the college updates its guidance when new evidence comes to light.\"\n\nA lack of awareness about withdrawal difficulties has meant that even medical professionals who prescribe the drugs have struggled to stop taking antidepressants themselves.\n\nDr Mark Horowitz, who tried to stop the antidepressants he had taken for 15 years in 2015, said: \"It led to complete havoc in my life,\" he says. \"I would wake up in the morning in full panic, like I was being chased by an animal.\"\n\nThe panic he felt would last until late into the evenings and he took up running as a distraction.\n\n\"I ran until my feet bled, because it gave me a slight reprieve from that panic sensation.\"\n\nHe said it was worse than the symptoms that led him to take antidepressants in the first place.\n\nPanorama examines whether the current generation of antidepressant drugs have lived up to their promises, following patients who have suffered serious side effects.\n\nWatch The Antidepressant Story on BBC One at 20:00 on Monday 19 June (20:30 in Wales and Northern Ireland) and on BBC iPlayer afterwards (UK only)\n\nHe is concerned that far more work has been done on how to start patients on antidepressants - and much less on stopping.\n\n\"To me, it's the same as allowing cars to be sold without brakes,\" he said.\n\n\"We should know how to start the car and how to stop it.\"\n\nNow Dr Horowitz runs England's only NHS antidepressant deprescribing clinic - a pilot scheme set up in London in 2021 to help people struggling to stop taking their medication.\n\nAt the moment he is seeing about 25 patients.\n\nDespite withdrawal guidance having been updated, Dr Horowitz thinks patients are still struggling to get tailored advice. Guidance for doctors now recommends that people reduce the dose of their medication in stages, but it does not specify how long it should take. It's different for everyone.\n\nDr Horowitz is still trying to reduce his antidepressant dose - and hopes to stop altogether this year\n\nThe Royal College of GPs told Panorama that family doctors were \"highly-trained to have frank and sensitive conversations\" with patients about the risks and benefits of antidepressants.\n\n\"Amid intense workload and workforce pressures,\" it said it was, \"increasingly difficult to offer patients the time they need within the constraints of a standard 10-minute consultation.\"\n\nThe companies behind the most widely used antidepressants told Panorama that many clinical trials and studies, including ones conducted by independent researchers, had shown their drugs to be effective.\n\nThey said the drugs had been taken by many millions worldwide for potentially devastating and sometimes life-threatening conditions.\n\nAs with all medicines, they said, antidepressants have potential side effects which are clearly stated in the prescribing information. They added that their drugs are considered to be safe, with a positive benefit-risk ratio by doctors, patients and regulators around the world.\n\u2022 None Antidepressants exit must be slow - says watchdog", "The Irish delegation raised concerns at a meeting of the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference\n\nThe British and Irish governments have clashed over the UK's controversial bill dealing with the legacy of the Troubles in Northern Ireland.\n\nIt happened during a meeting of the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference in London (BIIGC) on Monday.\n\nIt is understood Irish delegation raised concerns over the impact on investigations into loyalists attacks in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe BIIGC was set up by the Good Friday Agreement and meets twice a year.\n\nThe UK government's legislation on dealing with the legacy of the Troubles in Northern Ireland offers a conditional amnesty to those accused of killings and other Troubles-related crimes.\n\nIt has been criticised by victims' groups, the Irish government and political parties at Stormont.\n\nMiche\u00e1l Martin said both governments need to work together on the issue of legacy\n\nOn Monday, it is understood the UK government was challenged on how its plan to end all police investigations as part of its legacy bill will affect ongoing Garda (Irish police) investigations into loyalist attacks.\n\nIrish government representatives highlighted both the Dublin and Monaghan bombings in 1974 when 33 people were killed and also the loyalist bomb attacks in Belturbet, County Cavan, in 1972 when two teenagers were fatally injured.\n\nLast year Garda\u00ed released two photofit images of a suspect in the Belturbet attacks as part of its cross-border investigation.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference, T\u00e1naiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Miche\u00e1l Martin said both governments needed to work together on the issue of legacy.\n\nHe said he had an issue with people being granted immunity.\n\n\"We have fundamental concerns about the legislation currently before parliament,\" Mr Martin told the BIIGC press conference.\n\n\"We don't believe it is compliant with the European Convention on Human Rights,\" he added.\n\nChris Heaton-Harris said there was a \"complete agreement\" on the need for a restored executive\n\nMeanwhile, the Stormont stalemate was top of the agenda at the meeting for Northern Ireland secretary Chris Heaton-Harris.\n\nHe said both governments were in \"complete agreement\" on the need for the restoration of the Northern Ireland executive.\n\nMr Heaton-Harris said the local election results highlighted that the people of Northern Ireland wanted restoration as well.\n\nSinn F\u00e9in emerged as the biggest party in both local government and the Stormont assembly following recent elections.\n\nLast week, DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson said the UK government was well aware of his party's concerns on the protocol which needed to be addressed before a return to Stormont.\n\nSinn F\u00e9in vice-president Michelle O'Neill called on the DUP to clarify what it has asked the government for in relation to the working of the NI Protocol.\n\nMs O'Neill said it was \"unacceptable\" that the DUP seemed to be holding private discussions with the government.\n\nAsked about Monday night's Commons debate on the privileges committee report that found former PM Boris Johnson misled parliament, Ms O'Neill said she would not comment on how MPs should vote but said \"Boris Johnson has been a disaster from start to finish\".\n\nMPs later voted by a margin of 354 to seven to approve the report.\n\nThe BIIGC is one of the few such bodies unaffected by the Democratic Unionist Party's (DUP) boycott of Stormont.\n\nMr Heaton-Harris's number two, Steve Baker, and Irish Justice Minister Helen McEntee were also at the meeting.\n\nThe meeting was held as talks continued between the UK government and the DUP.\n\nIt is understood the party is looking for changes to the legislation governing the Northern Ireland Protocol as well as further constitutional guarantees.\n\nLast week Mr Heaton-Harris caused raised eyebrows when he said he did not know what the DUP was asking for -

particularly in the city centre.\n\nIt argues that the lettings have exacerbated housing shortages and fuelled anti-social behaviour.\n\nHosts have until 1 October to apply for a licence, with people who list whole properties on sites such as Airbnb also needing to apply for planning permission.\n\nRenting out a room in your own home, or letting your home while on holiday, would still be allowed.\n\nOpponents of the scheme raised \u00a3300,000 through crowdfunding for a judicial review at the Court of Session, which was said to be largest amount raised for a case in the UK.\n\nThe case centred on a presumption against allowing entire flats within tenement blocks to be used as holiday lets unless their owners could demonstrate why they should be exempt.\n\nLord Braid ruled that the presumption was unlawful and that the lack of provision for temporary licences and requirement for some hosts to supply floor coverings went beyond the council's powers.\n\nHe said the policy was unlawful because it breached existing laws on what licensing authorities could do under the law.\n\nThe judge wrote: \"It is not the function of the respondent's licensing authority to decide that a licence should not be granted because a property is of a particular type or is in a particular area.\n\n\"For the respondent to adopt a normal practice of not granting an short term licence for premises in a tenement, even where planning permission had been granted, is irrational and contrary to the purposes of the overall statutory scheme.\n\n\"It would be perverse and oppressive for the respondent, upon receipt of a licensing application, to require an applicant to obtain planning permission for a tenement property; and thereafter, planning permission having been obtained, to refuse the licence for no other reason than that the property was in a tenement.\"\n\nThe Scottish government says that in certain areas - particularly tourist hot spots - high numbers of lets can cause problems for neighbours and make it harder for people to find homes to live in.\n\nSupporters of the licensing scheme say short-term lets are causing a housing shortage and increasing anti-social behaviour in the capital\n\nCouncil leader Cammy Day said he made \"absolutely no apology for seeking to protect our residents\" despite the ruling.\n\nHe added: \"It is no secret that we face unique housing pressures here in Edinburgh, with a small but densely populated city centre and fast growing population, and it's crucial for us to strike the right balance between promoting our visitor economy while looking after the people that live here all year round.\n\n\"Our residents have told us that, in many cases, short-term lets are hollowing out their communities, reducing housing supply and increasing housing costs.\n\n\"We can't forget that many have endured years of disturbance and anti-social behaviour and we will continue to work hard to get this right.\"\n\nMr Day said the court had \"acknowledged our intention to find a solution to this and agreed that it was legitimate to use both planning and licensing policy\", with the council now considering its next steps.\n\nA statement issued by the petitioners in response to the judgement said they hoped it would lead the council and government to \"seek a fresh approach that aims to collaborate and work with local operators of self-catering accommodation, recognising the many good things it brings to the economy and people of Scotland\".\n\nIt added: \"As the largest crowdfunded case in the history of the UK, the petitioner team are deeply grateful to the many small, local businesses that supported the campaign financially in such uncertain times.\n\n\"That grass roots support made it possible for us to take this action, challenging both licensing and planning surrounding short-term lets in Edinburgh and the potential wider impact across urban and rural Scotland.\"\n\nFiona Campbell, chief executive of the Association of Scotland's Self-Caterers, welcomed the ruling, which she said would also have ramifications for other licensing schemes across Scotland.\n\nShe said: \"The Scottish government need to go back to the drawing board on short-term let regulation and engage constructively with industry to provide a regulatory framework that works for all stakeholders.\"\n\nThe proposals were approved by the council's planning committee last year after 88% of the 5,600 people who responded to a consultation on the proposals supported the introduction of the licensing scheme.\n\nEilidh Keay from tenants' union Living Rent Edinburgh said the decision \"demonstrates how a small group of people can use their money and power to weaponise the legal system to their advantage\".\n\nShe said: \"This flies completely in the face of democracy and the will of the people.\n\n\"Edinburgh needs homes, not holiday lets. In coming down in support of short-term let operators, this decision seems to have forgotten that Edinburgh is in the midst of a housing crisis.\n\n\"It is disgusting that the profit of short-term let operators should be put before the needs of tenants, residents and communities for homes.\"", "The UK is sending 14 Challenger 2 tanks to Kyiv to aid Ukrainians in the fight against Russia\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin has said Russia would be \"forced to react\" if the UK sent shells made with depleted uranium to Ukraine.\n\nHe accused the West of deploying weapons with a \"nuclear component\".\n\nThe UK Ministry of Defence confirmed it would provide Kyiv the armour-piercing rounds alongside Challenger 2 tanks but insisted they had a low radiation risk.\n\nDepleted uranium \"is a standard component and has nothing to do with nuclear weapons\", the MoD said.\n\n\"The British Army has used depleted uranium in its armour piercing shells for decades,\" the statement added.\n\n\"Russia knows this, but is deliberately trying to disinform.

But it is a very heavy substance, 1.7 times denser than lead, and it is used to harden rounds so that they can penetrate armour and steel.\n\nWhen a weapon made with a depleted uranium tip or core strikes a solid object, like the side of a tank, it goes straight through it and then erupts in a burning cloud of vapour.\n\nThe vapour settles as dust, which is poisonous and also weakly radioactive.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said sending depleted uranium ammunition to Ukraine would mean the UK was \"ready to violate international humanitarian law as in 1999 in Yugoslavia\".\n\n\"There is no doubt this will end badly for London,\" Mr Lavrov added.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, a spokesman for the Pentagon said the US would not be sending any munitions with depleted uranium to Ukraine.\n\nShells with depleted uranium were used in Iraq and the Balkans, where some claim it was linked to birth defects.\n\nA 2022 UN Environment Programme (UNEP) report said depleted uranium was an environmental concern in Ukraine.\n\n\"Depleted uranium and toxic substances in common explosives can cause skin irritation, kidney failure and increase the risks of cancer,\" it said.\n\n\"The chemical toxicity of depleted uranium is considered a more significant issue than the possible impacts of its radioactivity,\" it added.", "A scene from \"Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey\"\n\nA new Winnie the Pooh horror movie will not be released in Hong Kong and Macau, its distributor has said.\n\nVII Pillars Entertainment apologised for the \"disappointment and inconvenience\" to viewers in the Chinese special administrative regions.\n\nThe film was released in the US in February and across the UK in March.\n\nReferences to the original, family-friendly version of Winnie the Pooh have been used to protest against President Xi Jinping in recent years.\n\nThe meme began after an image showing China's President Xi Jinping and former US President Barack Obama began circulating in 2013.\n\nCensors in China have since clamped down on references to AA Milne's character, and the 2018 Christopher Robin film was banned in the country.\n\nThis meme showing Xi Jinping and former US President Barack Obama began circulating in 2013\n\nHong Kong's Office for Film, Newspaper and Article Administration denied the film had been censored, saying it had issued a certificate of approval for the horror movie.\n\nThe office told Reuters it would not comment on commercial decisions made about the movie.\n\nThe film's director Rhys Frake-Waterfield told Reuters: \"The cinemas agreed to show it, then all independently come to the same decision overnight.

It's to go from something which is possible to use because it's now publicly available, and just go off on an extreme tangent from that point and make this horrific alternative version to him.\"", "Labour has ruled out introducing a self-ID system to allow people to change their legal sex without a medical diagnosis.\n\nLeader Sir Keir Starmer has previously said his party would introduce such a system if it wins power.\n\nBut shadow women and equalities secretary Anneliese Dodds has now said medical diagnosis upholds \"confidence in the system\".\n\nShe added that the requirement also helps people access NHS support.\n\nIn a article for the Guardian, she wrote that Labour would streamline the current medical diagnosis rules, calling them \"demeaning\".\n\nThe new Labour position appears to be a compromise that has emerged from a party event in Nottingham over the weekend to discuss policy.\n\nIt opens up a split with Scottish Labour, which has previously voted to remove the medical diagnosis requirement and has since confirmed it \"continues to support the de-medicalisation of the process in Scotland\".\n\nUnder current rules, people who want to change legal sex need to provide a medical report showing a diagnosis of gender dysphoria.\n\nThis is defined by the NHS as a \"sense of unease that a person may have because of a mismatch between their biological sex and their gender identity\".\n\nApplicants also have to provide evidence of living full time in their acquired gender for at least two years.\n\nSome campaigners say the the requirement is excessively bureaucratic and invasive, and have long argued for a non-medical process - known as self-identification - instead.\n\nThe government ruled out adopting this approach in 2020 after a consultation, but has reduced the fees and moved the process online.\n\nLabour pledged to introduce a self-identification system under previous leader Jeremy Corbyn and the policy was in the party's 2019 general election manifesto.\n\nSir Keir reaffirmed the 2019 manifesto commitment to \"introduce self-declaration\" in a June 2021 video for LGBT website Pink News.\n\nHowever, Ms Dodds has now confirmed that the party would keep the need for a gender dysphoria diagnosis, calling it an \"important part\" of the process for obtaining a gender recognition certificate.\n\n\"Requiring a diagnosis upholds legitimacy of applications and confidence in the system,\" she wrote.\n\nShe said that it also helped refer trans people into the NHS for support services, citing low levels of awareness about how to access them.\n\nShe added that Labour wanted to avoid the \"mistakes\" made by the Scottish government, whose new law to ditch medical reports is subject to an ongoing legal wrangle with the UK government.\n\nScottish ministers' legislation - endorsed by Scottish Labour in the Scottish Parliament - showed a \"cavalier approach\", she added.\n\nHowever, she added the current requirement to apply to an \"anonymous\" panel to obtain a certificate should be replaced, calling it \"demeaning for trans people and meaningless in practice\".\n\nInstead, she said it \"should be enough\" for registrars to sign off the application, based on diagnosis from one doctor.\n\nThe LGBT+ Labour group said the party's new position would be a \"huge step forward\" for trans people over the current government stance.\n\nBut it added the party was \"signalling a retreat on their policy of de-medicalised self-ID for the trans community at the next general election\".\n\nLabour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle, a patron of the group, told the BBC it would push for further changes, including giving non-medical professionals such as social workers the power to \"externally verify\" someone's acquired gender.\n\nRosie Duffield, who had threatened to quit as a Labour MP over the party's previous stance, said she welcomed the retention of medical reports, calling it the \"core thing\" demanded by women's groups.\n\nMs Duffield, the MP for Canterbury, has opposed self-ID as a way for trans people to gain access to single sex spaces such as domestic violence refuges and prisons.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she called for more clarity on the party's position ahead of the general election, expected next year, adding it still included a \"bit of confusion and a bit of fence-sitting\".\n\nWomen and Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch said Labour's new position is a \"copy and paste\" of the government's position.\n\nAdding that some Labour MPs had previously attacked the Conservative position as prejudiced, she accused the party of \"bare-faced hypocrisy\".", "Heathrow Airport has said that some passengers may face security delays over the Easter holidays due to strike action over pay.\n\nHundreds of security officers in the Unite union, who work for Heathrow Airport, have begun 10 days of industrial action.\n\nIt threatens disruption at the UK's largest airport at the start of the Easter school holidays.\n\nHowever, Heathrow said the airport was operating \"as normal\" on Friday.\n\nThe strike involves security guards at Terminal 5, which is only used by British Airways, and those who check cargo. Unite has accused the airport of a real-terms wage cut.\n\nHeathrow said it had offered a 10% pay increase back-dated to 1 January, plus a lump sum payment of more than \u00a31,000.\n\nThe airport said contingency plans were keeping the airport operating as usual.\n\nHowever, British Airways cancelled about 70 flights on Friday. This included flights already removed from the schedule due to the strikes, and cancellations for other reasons, such as bad weather and an air traffic control strike in France.\n\nPicket lines were mounted outside the airport and Unite said the strike was being \"well supported\".\n\nHeathrow chief executive John Holland-Kaye told the BBC \"many\" security staff had chosen to work on Friday, but \"a lot\" of agency security staff had been brought in, alongside \"hundreds\" of managers who were \"here to help\".\n\n\"The airport is operating as normal,\" he said.\n\nAre you a security officer striking at Heathrow, or a passenger concerned about your travel plans being disrupted? Share your experiences.\n\nThe next few days are expected to be busy as people get away on Easter holidays.\n\nAhead of the strike, Heathrow asked airlines to stop selling tickets and allow customers to change travel dates.\n\nBritish Airways pre-emptively cancelled 300 flights and Virgin Atlantic confirmed it had limited new ticket sales and introduced a flexible policy.\n\nThe strike reduces the number of security staff available to the airport on what is normally a very busy weekend.\n\nHeathrow said it was deploying 1,000 extra colleagues and its management team to assist passengers.\n\nTravellers should check their flight before travelling to the airport, arriving at Heathrow no earlier than two hours before short-haul flights and three hours before long-haul flights, and be ready for security, the airport said.\n\nPassengers will only be permitted to go through security with two items of hand luggage to help the flow.\n\nThe aviation industry more broadly is under pressure from the government and the industry regulator to avoid a repeat of last year's Easter's queues, delays and cancellations, which were largely caused by staff shortages.\n\nA leaked letter to businesses from the Civil Aviation Authority and the Department for Transport, seen by the BBC, says it would be unacceptable for consumers to face the same level of disruption this year.\n\nAirlines and airports have told the BBC they are confident of having enough staff in place this time round, although external factors such as strikes in France affecting air traffic control could cause issues.", "The Empire Pool and trolley buses - two sights no longer seen in Cardiff\n\nSome of the last traces of arguably the biggest event ever to be hosted in Wales are set to disappear.\n\nWith 1,130 athletes from 35 countries descending on Cardiff, experts believe the country may never see the like of the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games again.\n\nLittle remains of the venues used, with the Sophia Gardens Pavilion demolished in 1982 and the Empire Pool in 1998.\n\nThe velodrome at Maindy could soon be bulldozed too under plans.\n\nIt is the last remnant of an event sports author Huw Richards believes trumps the 1999 Rugby World Cup as the biggest hosted here.\n\n\"As soon as you set foot in the Arms Park, and saw the gathering of elite athletes from all over the globe, you could feel a sense that Wales had become a grown-up member of the world community,\" is how cultural historian Prof Peter Stead described the games.\n\nFor younger generations, Maindy Velodrome is best known for nurturing some of Wales' greatest cycling talents, including 2018 Tour de France winner Geraint Thomas.\n\nBut it is also where riders battled it out for gold in 1958.\n\nUnder proposals, an expansion of Cathays High School would see the velodrome lost, and a new track built at Cardiff Bay.\n\nBritish cyclist Ray Booty waves as he gets the chequered flag to win the 120 miles road race - which started and finished in St Brides Major, Vale of Glamorgan\n\nThe club that uses it, Maindy Flyers, said the prospect of \"being left with nothing for future generations of cyclists\" was \"unacceptable\".\n\nCardiff council replied by saying it fully understands the site's \"historic nature\", but the new velodrome had the support of the national governing body for cycling.\n\nCardiff Central station remains - but the frontage looked a bit different in 1958\n\nSimilar pain was felt by the swimming community when another of the venues from 1958 disappeared.\n\nThe Empire Pool had 1,722 seats, diving boards and the country's only 50m pool - but was flattened as the Millennium Stadium rose up to dominate the city centre in the late '90s.\n\n\"The Empire Pool was an iconic facility in the heart of the capital that not only opened its doors to the world at the 1958 Empire Games, but also served to develop some of our nation's finest athletes,\" said Swim Wales' head of aquatics and inclusion Sioned Williams.\n\n\"To lose this piece of history was a big blow to the Welsh aquatics community.\"\n\nHowever, she said its replacement, the Wales National Pool in Swansea has become a \"thriving hub\" for its elite programme and events, while there is also now an Olympic-sized pool in Cardiff Bay.\n\nOpening ceremony for the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games at Cardiff Arms Park\n\nComing three years after Cardiff was confirmed as capital, the 1958 games were \"a significant moment\" for the nation, according to sports historian Huw Richards.\n\nBut he added: \"It has to be remembered that they were rather smaller than they have since become - with just over 1,100 athletes in 94 events, compared to 5,000 competing in 280 at the most recent games in Birmingham.\"\n\nCardiff Arms Park was where the drama on the track unfolded - but it looked very different then, a 60,000-capacity stadium where Cardiff RFC and the national rugby side played.\n\nA series of redesigns means it now holds 12,500, with the only remaining parts the Gwyn Nicholls Memorial Gates - erected in 1949 to commemorate one of Wales' greatest rugby players.\n\nThe Empire Pool and other buildings were demolished as the new Millennium Stadium - now the Principality Stadium - rose up on the banks of the River Taff in the mid '90s\n\nIt stands in the shadow of the Principality Stadium next door, the site of which has also undergone massive transformation since 1958.\n\nWork on a new National Stadium began in 1969, with it not officially opened until 1984.\n\nBut just 11 years later, it was decided to demolish it for a super-stadium to host the 1999 Rugby World Cup.\n\nThis tournament is the main rival to the 1958 games as Wales' biggest ever event - but comparisons do not stand up to scrutiny, according to Mr Richards.\n\n\"In 1999, Wales was the host of record, staging the opening game and the final, but the event was spread evenly across all of what were then the five nations,\" he added.\n\n\"Wales had only nine games out of 41. The other four nations got eight each and the most memorable of them, the two semi-finals, were both at Twickenham.\"\n\nHe said this makes it \"all the odder\" Wales is the only nation to build a new stadium for a Rugby World Cup.\n\nA recent poll on European membership is something most people are familiar with - votes from another were counted at the Sophia Gardens Pavilion in 1975\n\nSophia Gardens Pavilion, which hosted boxing and wrestling in 1958, was also a concert venue, with Pink Floyd and Jimi Hendrix among those appearing.\n\nHowever, its end came in 1982 after its roof collapsed under heavy snow.\n\nShirley Bassey returned home to perform at the Sophia Gardens Pavilion in November 1961\n\nThere is one location used for the 1958 Cardiff-hosted event that remains untouched - and it is 170 miles (274 km) away.\n\nRowing took place on Llyn Padarn in Eryri, also known as Snowdonia.\n\nLlyn Padarn in Eryri: One location for the 1958 games is in no danger of falling victim to redevelopments in Cardiff\n\nOther big events to come to Wales include golf's Ryder Cup, a Champions League final and an Ashes test - but they were far shorter.\n\nTourism consultant Prof Terry Stevens believes if Wales was to host the Commonwealth Games again, it would probably be in collaboration with other nations.\n\n\"What used to be fairly straightforward, a cycle, is far more complicated now,\" he said.\n\n\"It's not just money, there are lots of other objectives of the organisers, plus TV deals. It used to be done on a 'your turn next' basis. Now it's much more nuanced, sophisticated.\n\n\"If you go back 15 years, relatively few venues could hold these big events. Now, every city has at least one decent venue - it's incredibly competitive.\"\n\nMr Stevens said sporting bodies increasingly wanted events hosted by multiple countries, such as the next World Cup in the USA, Canada and Mexico.\n\nThis puts the bid of the UK nations and Ireland for Euro 2028 in a strong position, he believes, especially considering its rival Turkey is going solo.\n\n\"It doesn't prevent Wales going alone for one-off games like the Champions League or a golf competition with one course,\" he added.\n\n\"The trend is Wales would have to collaborate to host the Commonwealth Games. It doesn't deny us, it's just a different model.\"", "Last updated on .From the section European Football\n\nManchester City's long quest to win the Champions League finally ended in triumph against Inter Milan in Istanbul as Pep Guardiola's side completed the Treble.\n\nAfter winning the Premier League and FA Cup, City emulated Manchester United's triple trophy haul in 1999 as they became only the second English club to achieve the feat after Rodri's crisp 68th-minute strike settled an attritional final.\n\nGuardiola's all-conquering side were never at their best against a brilliantly organised Inter and had to cope with the loss of Kevin de Bruyne to injury in the first half.\n\nBut the massed ranks of City fans inside Ataturk Stadium did not care about that as they joyously celebrated the greatest night - and season - in the club's history.\n\nAnd for Guardiola, it seals his status as one of the managerial greats as he added a third Champions League to the two he won at Barcelona, the last coming in 2011.\n\nThis was never the walkover many predicted and City had to survive a few scares when Federico Dimarco's header bounced off the bar and Ederson made a stunning late save to deny Romelu Lukaku but ultimately this was all about the victory.\n\nNow Guardiola and his players can take their place in history.\n\u2022 None Have your say on Man City's performance here\n\nThe Champions League has brought suffering to City and Guardiola - especially when they lost to Premier League rivals Chelsea in the 2021 final - but all the pain disappeared just before midnight on a sultry night in Istanbul.\n\nCity survived late anxiety, especially when Inter substitute Lukaku headed straight at Ederson with the goal at his mercy, but there was an explosion of joy on the pitch and in the stands at Ataturk Stadium as they finally secured the giant trophy that has remained so elusively beyond their grasp for so long.\n\nGuardiola said, whether it was fair or not, that his time at Manchester City would be judged on whether he was able to bring the Champions League to the club. Now that judgement can be made.\n\nThe Catalan, who won the Champions League with Barcelona in 2009 and 2011, will now be an iconic figure at City as well as Barcelona.\n\u2022 None 'Hysterical and hated at times' - but Guardiola is the greatest\n\nIt is a simple fact that many outside the Abu Dhabi-owned club will always view their triumph through the prism of the charges of 115 financial breaches brought against them by the Premier League, charges they fiercely deny.\n\nFor City's owners, with Sheikh Mansour attending only his second game since taking control in 2008, this was the night they have planned for and the one when they finally claimed that holy grail.\n\nThis was an evening when only the result mattered to City, not the manner in which their greatest victory was achieved.\n\nThis was not a win secured with the dazzling style and creation that is usually their hallmark. In fact for long periods it was a scrappy, sloppy performance in the face of a well-drilled Inter side who were right in this Champions League Final until the whistle went.\n\nNone of that will matter now. All that will be recalled forever about this game by City's fans was the moment when Rodri arrived on the end of build-up play from Manuel Akanji and Bernardo Silva to send that precise right-foot finish away from the reach of Inter's outstanding keeper Andre Onana.\n\nAnd of course the triumphant Champions League trophy lift.\n\nCity lived dangerously in the closing minutes and, when it was all over, Guardiola, so agitated in his technical area, was relatively calm as he sought out opposite number Simone Inzaghi for consoling words.\n\nJohn Stones was once again outstanding for City while keeper Ederson made key contributions when required.\n\nThe celebrations at the final whistle reflected a magnificent season as City finally got their hands on the Champions League trophy and prepared to parade it around the streets of Manchester along with the Premier League and FA Cup on Monday.\n\u2022 None Attempt saved.

Plus there are no early exit fees - so people are not tied to the contract if their circumstances change, and you can leave without paying a penalty.\n\nAccording to Ofcom's affordability tracker one in three UK households had an issue affording their communication services, reflecting the ongoing pressures that people are facing.\n\nOfcom says more than half of eligible households continue to be unaware of social tariffs and that more needs to be done to encourage people to get the support - a similar plea was made last year.\n\nThe watchdog is concerned that broadband providers are still not being upfront with millions of customers about how to find and sign up to these packages.\n\nOf eligible customers that are aware of social tariffs, most had heard about them through social media and from television.\n\nBut just 9% found out about social tariffs through their provider. Ofcom says that highlights how the industry needs to go further to promote their social tariffs effectively and make them easier to find.\n\nLindsey Fussell, Ofcom's director of network and communication, said she believed broadband providers should go further, \"at a time when these savings could make a massive difference\".\n\n\"We're urging anyone who thinks they could be eligible for a discount deal to contact their provider today and potentially save hundreds of pounds,\" she said.", "Ever since this row kicked off, I've wondered whether the prime minister had heard about Baroness Hallett's reputation.\n\nIf there were a national prize for Least Likely To Be A Pushover, this tough no-nonsense former Court of Appeal judge would probably win it.

I oversimplify, but after some legal trench warfare, Hallett ruled that the bereaved families must know the facts.\n\nMI5's attempt to overturn that decision in the High Court, with the help of the then Home Secretary Theresa May, was so thin that a judge declared part of their argument to be \"hopeless\" .\n\nLady Justice Hallett had called the law right: there is inevitably a place for confidentiality or secrecy when it comes to sensitive national secrets. But there must also be transparency for the victims of an appalling tragedy.\n\nAnd in the aftermath, ministers found themselves accused of a spectacularly clumsy attempt to cover up the truth.

It's a name rich in Labour history: Keir Hardie was the party's first leader.\n\nIf Labour won on this scale nationally, they would be in government with a colossal majority.\n\nThe party that has campaigned so fruitfully for so long on the perceived failings of Boris Johnson has failed to take Uxbridge and South Ruislip, the very seat he used to represent.\n\nJust days ago, the Conservatives were ready to blame what they described privately as \"Long Boris\" to explain away their losses.\n\nIn other words, don't blame us, blame the prime minister before last.\n\nBut now they have won where he was the MP, and lost in two places where he wasn't.\n\nDowning Street had not anticipated a photo opportunity where smiles would feature today.\n\nBut before some of us had reached for the breakfast cereal Rishi Sunak was beaming in Uxbridge.\n\nAnd his message is one we will keep hearing, I suspect: the general election is not a done deal, and where voters see what he will claim is the \"reality of Labour\" they vote Conservative.\n\nTo hear Conservatives this morning talking about Uxbridge was to hear those swimming through the roughest of rough political seas, and then seeing an unlikely raft upon which to climb, and breathe a brief sigh of relief.\n\nLabour are disappointed to lose in Uxbridge.\n\nPublicly, and more candidly in private, they blame the expansion of London's Ultra Low Emissions Zone (Ulez), a policy idea blamed by many voters on the Labour mayor of London, Sadiq Khan.\n\n\"If you run on a ticket about the cost of living but you are blamed for adding 90 quid a week to the cost of living for some, it's going to be difficult,\" acknowledged one party figure.\n\nThe Ulez daily charge is \u00a312.50 a day. If a driver fails to pay the charge, or broke the penalty charge rules, the bill could be higher.\n\nLabour's failure to take Uxbridge presents three niggles for the party, as they look to the general election:\n\nEqually, if you are one of the innumerable Labour figures desperate to not sound complacent, losing in Uxbridge rather helps.\n\nAnd what about the Liberal Democrats?\n\nTheir win in Somerton and Frome was huge.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

At a general election, the demands on staffing would be even more brutal.\n\nBut the party does now have ample evidence that they have overcome the paralysing hangover of the coalition years, and are competitive again - and dangerous, particularly to the Tories.\n\nOverall, the scope for Conservative comfort anywhere after these results is very slender.\n\nBut not as slender as it might have been.", "John Allan is stepping down as chairman of Tesco following allegations over his conduct.\n\nMr Allan, who is also a former president of the CBI business lobby group, has strongly denied three of four claims made against him.\n\nHowever, board member Byron Grote, who will temporarily replace Mr Allan as chairman, said: \"These allegations risk becoming a distraction to Tesco.\"\n\nTesco said it had made \"no findings of wrongdoing\".\n\nMr Allan will leave Tesco in June after eight years in the role.\n\nHe said: \"It is with regret that I am having to prematurely stand down from my position as chair of Tesco following the anonymous and unsubstantiated allegations made against me, as reported by the Guardian.\"\n\nA report in the Guardian had claimed that Mr Allan had touched a Tesco employee at the supermarket giant's annual shareholder meeting last year.\n\nIt also alleged that Mr Allan \"grabbed\" an employee at a CBI event in 2019.

It is an issue that is emotionally charged like few others. And particularly now as war in Europe again looms large.\n\nBoth sides accuse each other of irrational ideology.\n\nConservative commentators and politicians say the country is in thrall to Green Party dogma, that scraps domestic nuclear power at a time when cutting Russian energy means rising prices. They accuse the government of increasing reliance on fossil fuels instead of using nuclear, which has lower emissions.\n\n\"It's a black day for climate protection in Germany,\" said Jens Spahn, conservative CDU MP, on RTL television earlier this week.\n\nThere have been attempts to rid Germany of nuclear power for decades\n\nGreens and left-wingers argue that it is illogical to cling to nuclear power, which is more expensive than wind or solar. The government argues that keeping the three ageing atomic power stations online would need huge investment \u2014 funds that should go into renewable energy sources.\n\nIt is odd for the CDU to suddenly champion climate protection, say Green Party MPs, given that the conservatives regularly block measures to expand renewable energy infrastructure.\n\nIronically, given the CDU's current fight for nuclear, it was a conservative-led government under Angela Merkel that decided to phase out atomic power after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster. Her decision was popular with voters, coming on the back of widespread anti-nuclear sentiment sparked by the catastrophe. Cynics suggest that upcoming key regional elections may have influenced her decision.\n\nToday, Germany gets almost half of its electricity from renewables - 44% in 2022, according to the Federal Statistical Office - and just 6% from atomic power. Green economy minister Robert Habeck predicts that 80% of Germany's electricity will be renewable by 2030 and has pushed through laws to make it quicker and easier to build solar and wind farms.\n\nBut over the last year, the proportion of renewables has stagnated while CO2 emissions have increased, as Germany has been forced to import liquefied natural gas (LNG) and use more coal instead of Russian gas. This has sparked even some Green voters and anti-nuclear activists to support temporarily extending the lifespan of the last three nuclear power stations.\n\nIn an article published in Friday's edition of the newspaper Der Tagesspiegel, Green Party environment minister Steffi Lemke wrote that Germany was shutting down nuclear because catastrophic accidents can never be ruled out, \"whether it be through human error like Chernobyl, natural disasters like Fukushima\u2026 or attacks, as Ukraine is suffering because of Russia's war\".\n\nGermany does not need nuclear, she argues, because renewables are safer, more sustainable, better for the climate and make more economic sense.\n\nDespite predictions of shortages and blackouts, Germany produces more energy than it needs, exporting energy to France over the summer, note Green Party leaders pointedly, where nuclear power stations could not operate because of extreme weather.\n\nVoters are divided. According to this week's ARD-DeutschlandTrend poll, 59% of Germans are against shutting down atomic energy, with only 34% in favour. Support for nuclear is strongest amongst older and conservative voters.\n\nBut more detailed questioning reveals a nuanced picture. In a YouGov poll from earlier this week, 65% supported keeping the three remaining nuclear power stations running for now. But only 33% wanted Germany to keep nuclear power indefinitely. In other words, pull the plug - but just not quite yet.\n\nMany supporters of nuclear power argue it is a cleaner fuel than some other options\n\nOn Thursday, the conservative leader of Bavaria Markus S\u00f6der visited Isar 2, and called for Germany to not only keep the last three reactors online, but also to reactivate old power stations - including one shut down in Bavaria by him.\n\nMeanwhile Christian Lindner, finance minister and head of the liberal FDP party - which is in Olaf Scholz' three-way governing coalition - this week again rebelled against the government's official line and called for the three power stations to stay active in reserve. Both leaders know that at this stage such ideas are technologically, legally and financially implausible. But looking at the polls they see political capital in the issue, whether the reactors are actually there or not.\n\nThe Green Party, which has its roots in the anti-nuclear movement of the 1970s, will be celebrating this weekend. But the party realises that their political opponents are ready to blame them for any future energy shortfalls, price hikes or missed CO2 targets. German atomic power will be gone. But politically, nuclear remains explosive.", "More than a quarter of patients on antidepressants in England - about two million people - have been taking them for five years, the BBC has found.\n\nThis is despite there being limited evidence of the benefits of taking the drugs for that length of time.\n\nA doctor who runs an NHS clinic helping people off the pills says withdrawal symptoms can make it hard for some to stop taking their medication.\n\nWithdrawal guidance was updated in 2019, but he says little has changed.\n\nMore than eight million people in England are on antidepressants - which are prescribed for depression, anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder and other conditions. That's one million more people than five years previously, NHS prescribing figures show.\n\nThe new figures on long-term use - for the period 2018-2022 - were provided to BBC Panorama by the NHS, following a Freedom of Information request. The data gives an overall picture but does not reflect the circumstances of individual patients, some of whom could be on antidepressants long-term for good reason.\n\nThe investigation also uncovered evidence that a leading drug company attempted 27 years ago to conceal possible withdrawal effects that one drug could cause.\n\nModern antidepressants - called SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Re-Uptake Inhibitors) - arrived from the late 1980s, including Prozac. They were quickly heralded as wonder drugs compared with earlier medications, some of which had serious side effects.\n\nThey were thought to treat depression by fixing an imbalance of the mood-regulating chemical serotonin in the brain. Researchers are now not clear how they work. One theory is that they simply change how you think or feel, rather than rectifying an underlying problem.\n\nThe NHS recommends antidepressants as a treatment for more severe depression. Talking therapy as well as exercise and lifestyle changes might be recommended instead of, or in combination with, the medication.\n\n\"Throughout my long and extensive career, I have seen people benefit from antidepressants,\" said Prof Wendy Burn, former president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists.\n\n\"I see them working in my clinical practice, I see lives being changed by them.\"\n\nBut she added: \"People are staying on antidepressants longer, and we don't really have long-term studies that support that.\"\n\nThere has long been a debate about how effective antidepressants are. The most comprehensive research, from the University of Oxford, suggests antidepressants do help some people, at least in the short-term.\n\nBut on average, their benefits are relatively modest, and the way people respond varies, with some not responding at all, according to the researcher who led the study.\n\nAnd there is some evidence to suggest that long-term antidepressant use may be linked to some health risks, such as heart problems and diabetes. It is also thought that long-term use may lead to a higher risk of withdrawal symptoms in some people.\n\nWithdrawal can happen when you stop a drug that your body has become used to.\n\nTaking that drug away too quickly, before the brain has had time to adjust, can lead to symptoms - including low mood and feelings of anxiety. Some symptoms overlap with the original condition the drug was prescribed for, which means the withdrawal can sometimes be confused with relapse.\n\nThe symptoms depend on the individual, which drug they were taking, and for how long. Many patients can stop taking antidepressants without experiencing any problems.\n\nIf you are affected by any of the issues in this article you can find details of organisations that can help via the BBC Action Line\n\nPanorama has uncovered evidence to suggest that one major drug company which manufactured SSRI antidepressants had become increasingly aware of a whole range of withdrawal symptoms from the mid-1990s, but was reluctant to share this information with the public and medicines regulators.\n\nA copy of a confidential 1996 memo from firm Pfizer - which originally sold sertraline, now the UK's most common antidepressant - shows employees discussing what the drug company would tell regulators in Norway.\n\n\"We should not volunteer to describe the withdrawal symptoms, but have an agreed list prepared in case they insist,\" the memo says.\n\nSome of the withdrawal reactions the memo refers to include sensory disturbances, sweating, nausea, insomnia, tremors, agitation and anxiety.\n\nPfizer no longer produces sertraline. Responding to Panorama's findings, a spokesperson said the company \"monitored and reported all adverse event data\" to licensing authorities, \"in line with its legal and regulatory obligations and updated sertraline labelling as required.\"\n\nIt added: \"Public health organisations and professional medical bodies throughout the world have recognised sertraline and other SSRIs as the treatment of choice for adult depression.\" The company said the drug's label warned about withdrawal and had been updated \"as required\".\n\nThe Royal College of Psychiatrists published updated information on withdrawal in 2019 - overseen by Prof Burn, who was its president at the time. It came after she heard testimony from patients who had experienced severe withdrawal effects.\n\nUntil then, guidance used by the NHS and the college maintained withdrawal was mostly mild and short-lived - lasting no more than about a week.\n\nNow NHS guidance reflects that it can be severe and longer-lasting for some, and withdrawal can last many months.\n\nA Royal College of Psychiatrists spokesperson told the BBC: \"Medicine continuously evolves, as does our knowledge of treating mental illness. As a result, the college updates its guidance when new evidence comes to light.\"\n\nA lack of awareness about withdrawal difficulties has meant that even medical professionals who prescribe the drugs have struggled to stop taking antidepressants themselves.\n\nDr Mark Horowitz, who tried to stop the antidepressants he had taken for 15 years in 2015, said: \"It led to complete havoc in my life,\" he says. \"I would wake up in the morning in full panic, like I was being chased by an animal.\"\n\nThe panic he felt would last until late into the evenings and he took up running as a distraction.\n\n\"I ran until my feet bled, because it gave me a slight reprieve from that panic sensation.\"\n\nHe said it was worse than the symptoms that led him to take antidepressants in the first place.\n\nPanorama examines whether the current generation of antidepressant drugs have lived up to their promises, following patients who have suffered serious side effects.\n\nWatch The Antidepressant Story on BBC One at 20:00 on Monday 19 June (20:30 in Wales and Northern Ireland) and on BBC iPlayer afterwards (UK only)\n\nHe is concerned that far more work has been done on how to start patients on antidepressants - and much less on stopping.\n\n\"To me, it's the same as allowing cars to be sold without brakes,\" he said.\n\n\"We should know how to start the car and how to stop it.\"\n\nNow Dr Horowitz runs England's only NHS antidepressant deprescribing clinic - a pilot scheme set up in London in 2021 to help people struggling to stop taking their medication.\n\nAt the moment he is seeing about 25 patients.\n\nDespite withdrawal guidance having been updated, Dr Horowitz thinks patients are still struggling to get tailored advice. Guidance for doctors now recommends that people reduce the dose of their medication in stages, but it does not specify how long it should take. It's different for everyone.\n\nDr Horowitz is still trying to reduce his antidepressant dose - and hopes to stop altogether this year\n\nThe Royal College of GPs told Panorama that family doctors were \"highly-trained to have frank and sensitive conversations\" with patients about the risks and benefits of antidepressants.\n\n\"Amid intense workload and workforce pressures,\" it said it was, \"increasingly difficult to offer patients the time they need within the constraints of a standard 10-minute consultation.\"\n\nThe companies behind the most widely used antidepressants told Panorama that many clinical trials and studies, including ones conducted by independent researchers, had shown their drugs to be effective.\n\nThey said the drugs had been taken by many millions worldwide for potentially devastating and sometimes life-threatening conditions.\n\nAs with all medicines, they said, antidepressants have potential side effects which are clearly stated in the prescribing information. They added that their drugs are considered to be safe, with a positive benefit-risk ratio by doctors, patients and regulators around the world.\n\u2022 None Antidepressants exit must be slow - says watchdog", "The stepfather of a five-year-old girl has pleaded guilty to her murder.\n\nNadia Zofia Kalinowska died after being found injured at her family home at Fernagh Drive in Newtownabbey in December 2019.\n\nHer mother, 28 year-old Aleksandra Wahab, and the child's stepfather, 34-year-old Abdul Wahab, went on trial on Wednesday at Belfast Crown Court, accused of murder.\n\nWhen the case resumed on Thursday, Abdul Wahab pleaded guilty to murder.\n\nThe Pakistani national also pleaded guilty to two charges of grievous bodily harm with intent 24 hours before the child's death and on other occasions between July and December that year.\n\nA minimum period, before he can be released, will be set at a future date.\n\nThe trial had been told the schoolgirl was tortured and killed in her home - a place where she should have felt safe.\n\nDuring the opening, Crown barrister Liam McCollum detailed the injuries inflicted on Nadia.\n\nAs well as suffering a skull fracture and lacerated liver which caused her death, Nadia had sustained fractures and re-fractures to her ribs, a fractured collarbone, a fractured pelvis and an injury to her bowel.\n\nAlso present at Nadia's time of death were 70 surface injuries including bruising and abrasions.\n\nNadia was rushed to hospital from her home in Newtownabbey\n\nThis led the Crown to conclude that Nadia had been subjected to a campaign of physical abuse in the family home which culminated in her death.\n\nAs the hearing was due to resume on Thursday, barristers for both Mr and Mrs Wahab asked that their clients be re-arraigned.\n\nAt this point Abdul Wahab bowed his head and tearfully pleaded guilty to the murder.\n\nAleksandra Wahab pleaded guilty to allowing the death of a child and allowing a child to suffer serious physical harm.\n\nThese pleas were accepted by the court and the jury was discharged.\n\nShe was remanded back into custody.\n\nAddressing the jury of seven men and five woman, the judge said that as both defendants had now pleaded guilty to three charges each, he directed them to return not guilty verdicts on all the remaining counts.\n\nA spokesperson for the school said: \"Our school community is still in shock at this terrible tragedy.

For months, they have championed his actions and attacked his opponents in the Ministry of Defence - particularly his sworn enemy, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu.\n\nBut when the Wagner mutiny was developing, their reaction was surprisingly muted.\n\nTwo of the largest groups, Grey Zone and Reverse Side of the Medal - with almost 900,000 followers between them - did not rush to endorse his actions, instead aiming for the reasonably neutral middle ground of blaming antagonism by Mr Shoigu and his loyalists for the bloodshed.\n\nFighters of Wagner group stand guard outside the headquarters of the Southern Military District in the city of Rostov-on-Don, Russia\n\nWagner PMC Briefs is a channel Prigozhin has confirmed as an official page of Wagner and is run by one of his troops.

He was accompanied by his young son,\" he said.\n\n\"Two gunmen appeared, fired multiple shots and John ran a short distance and, as he fell to the ground, gunmen continued to fire shots at him.\"\n\nACC McEwan paid tribute to a member of the public who administered first aid to the injured officer.\n\n\"At this time there were many other children. Those children ran for cover in sheer terror.\"\n\nBBC News NI understands that Det Ch Insp John Caldwell got up after being shot multiple times and warned children away from the area.\n\nChief Constable Simon Byrne said PSNI officers were shocked and angered by the brazen attack, and it had sent a \"huge shockwave\" across the organisation.\n\n\"John knows that his colleagues will now be working tirelessly around the clock to support his recovery but also to bring the offenders who have tried to kill him to swift justice,\" the chief constable said.\n\nThe term \"dissident republicans\" describes a range of individuals who do not accept the Good Friday Agreement - the 1998 peace deal which ended the worst of the Troubles in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe Provisional IRA - the main armed republican paramilitary group for most of the Troubles - declared a ceasefire in the run up to the agreement and officially ended its violent campaign in 2005.\n\nDissident republicanism is made up of various groups which broke away from the Provisional IRA in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, including the Continuity IRA and New IRA.\n\nThe groups are much smaller than the Provisional IRA, although they have access to high-calibre weapons and have used improvised explosive devices and mortars in attacks and attempted attacks.\n\nThey have continued to use violence to attempt to unite Northern Ireland with the Republic of Ireland in a single state but their activities have been sporadic and often undermined by the security services.\n\nThe New IRA is thought to be the largest and the most active of the armed groups that oppose the peace process in Northern Ireland.\n\nAttacks, particularly attacks of this nature, are relatively rare.\n\nThis car near a farmyard on the Racolpa Road outside Omagh is thought to have been used by the gunmen and was later burnt out\n\nNorthern Ireland officers work against \"a backdrop of substantial threat\" and the PSNI would do everything to support them, ACC McEwan added.\n\nPolice believe the gunmen made off in a small, dark car, which was found burnt out at Racolpa Road, outside Omagh.\n\nAn Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na (Irish police) said it had intensified patrolling in border counties.\n\nThe last gun attack on a PSNI officer was in January 2017. The PSNI officer was hit by automatic gunfire at a petrol station in north Belfast.\n\nForensics officers examine Det Ch Insp Caldwell's car at the sports complex where he was shot\n\nFifteen pupils from Omagh High School were at the sports complex at the time of the shooting, principal Christos Gaitatzis said.\n\nMr Gaitatzis said two pupils were beside Det Ch Insp Caldwell when he was shot and he was \"sickened to the stomach\" by the attack.\n\n\"Some pupils did not make it to school,\" he told the BBC's Talkback programme.\n\n\"It is very difficult as some of the children were next to the son of John and were helping him to get sports equipment out of the car. They saw everything.\"\n\nThe children had been left \"numb\" and it was very hard for them to comprehend what had happened, he added.\n\nBeragh Swifts FC was holding a training session at Youth Sport Omagh when the gun attack happened.\n\nIts chairman Ricky Lyons said that it was \"hard to put into words\" what the children had witnessed.\n\nHe said the children were being offered support and the Irish Football Association (IFA) had been in touch to offer counselling.\n\nHe said Det Ch Insp John Caldwell had been coaching at the centre for about 10 years.\n\n\"He was taking a kids training session - it's hard to compute that someone would try to attempt to kill John at that moment,\" he told BBC Evening Extra.\n\nIt is no surprise to learn the chief suspects in the attack are the New IRA.\n\nAfter years on the backfoot the organisation re-emerged with a bomb attack on a police patrol in Strabane last November.\n\nThe attack on John Caldwell is the most serious incident involving the targeting of an officer for many years.\n\nYou probably need to go back to 2011 and the murder of Ronan Kerr for anything comparable.\n\nLast night will be seen not only as an attack on a police officer but an officer who has been directly involved in investigating dissident republicans.\n\nAbout a year ago, on the advice of MI5, the security threat level was downgraded for the first time in over a decade.\n\nIn that context, the shock being felt within the PSNI today will likely be magnified.", "Melissa Joan Hart said this is the second time a mass shooting had occurred in her community\n\nUS actress Melissa Joan Hart has said she helped children flee after the Nashville school shooting.\n\nIn an emotional video on Instagram, Hart said her children go to school near The Covenant School, where an attacker opened fire on Monday.\n\nThe Sabrina The Teenage Witch actress said she and her husband helped a class of kindergartners escape and reunite with their families.\n\nThree children and three adults were killed in the shooting.\n\nThe children were nine-year-old pupils at the Christian private school.

Watch: 'No parent should have to receive that call'", "The boy was attacked near the school where he was a pupil\n\nThere are renewed concerns over levels of violence in French schools after two young teenagers were the victims of attacks, one of them fatal.\n\nA 15-year-old boy named as Shamseddin died in hospital on Friday.\n\nThe news came a day after he was beaten by a group of youths near his school in Viry-Chatillon, in the southern Paris suburbs.\n\n\"This extreme violence is becoming commonplace,\" said the town mayor, Jean-Marie Vilain.\n\nMr Vilain told French media the boy was walking home after a music class at about 16:30 local time on Thursday when he was set upon by a group of youths.\n\nAccording to witnesses, he was punched and kicked by the attackers, who were wearing balaclavas.\n\nHe was taken to the Necker hospital, a top paediatric hospital in Paris, but doctors were unable to save his life.\n\nOne 17-year-old teenager has been arrested by French police in the Viry-Chatillon murder case, the local prosecutor announced later. Police are still looking for other assailants.\n\nOn Tuesday, in another incident in the southern city of Montpellier, a 14-year-old girl named as Samara was placed in an artificial coma after she was beaten by a group shortly after leaving school.\n\nThree adolescents - a girl and two boys of roughly the same age as Samara - have been arrested and admitted taking part in the attack, police said. Samara has since regained consciousness.\n\nThe girl's mother told French media that Samara had been bullied by another girl at the school because she refused to follow Islamic dress codes.\n\n\"Samara puts on a bit of make-up. And this other girl wears the headscarf. All the time, she kept calling her an unbeliever,\" she said on French television on Wednesday.\n\n\"My daughter dresses like a European. Every day there were insults. It was physically and psychologically unbearable.\"\n\nHowever, the prosecutor's office in its initial report on the attack made no mention of a religious connection, saying the background was an argument over photographs shared on Snapchat.\n\nAnd speaking Thursday evening on another French television channel, Samara's mother read out a statement accusing the far-right of trying to use the attack to their own advantage.\n\n\"My daughter is a practising pious Muslim. She fasts during Ramadan and prays five times a day. Please do not use us to sully the name of our religion,\" she said.\n\nThe attacks have further heightened concerns about violence in schools, against a background of gangs, cyber-bullying and pressure to conform to Islamic rules.\n\nLast week, the headteacher of a school in Paris resigned saying he feared for his life after receiving death threats for telling a girl to remove her head covering in accordance with French law.\n\nIn the same week, several schools had to shut because of hoax bomb threats made by people claiming to be Islamic radicals.\n\nIn recent years, two teachers have been murdered by Islamist radicals.\n\nSamuel Paty was decapitated on the street in a Paris suburb in 2020, while Dominique Bernard was killed at his school in Arras in October last year.\n\nEarlier on Friday, French President Emmanuel Macron said schools needed to be \"shielded\" from \"uninhibited violence among our teenagers and sometimes among increasingly younger ones\".\n\nReacting to the two attacks, Marine Le Pen of the hard-right National Rally said: \"When will the government finally sit up and take the full measure of the savagery which is gnawing at our society?\"\n\nJean-Marie Vilain, the mayor of Viry-Chatillon, was in tears as he spoke to journalists of the death of Shamseddin, who - he said - left a mother and a younger sister with their lives in ruins.\n\n\"We have to teach our children that there is good and there is bad. And when you do something bad, you get punished. And maybe we need to learn again how to punish,\" he said.", "Alexander Malkevich (pictured) is a close associate of the head of the Wagner group, Yevgeny Prigozhin\n\nWhile Russia's notorious Wagner mercenaries have been at the forefront of fighting in Ukraine's ravaged eastern town of Bakhmut, a close associate of Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin has been involved in another battle - for the hearts and minds of people in occupied areas behind the front lines.\n\nAlexander Malkevich has helped set up pro-Russian TV stations in key areas captured since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022.\n\nThrough his links to Prigozhin the media boss has been involved in projects spreading Russian influence from Africa to the US and he is under Western sanctions for spreading disinformation.\n\nFormally, Malkevich's job is running state-funded TV in Prigozhin's home city, St Petersburg. But in the summer of 2022 he moved to then-occupied parts of Ukraine, making the southern city of Kherson his base.\n\nHis main task was to set up pro-Russian television stations in regions captured since the start of the full-scale invasion. He has masterminded Tavria TV in Kherson, Za TV in Melitopol and Mariupol 24 in the eastern Donetsk region.\n\nAlexander Malkevich (right) has recruited underage reporters for his propaganda channels\n\nThe channels' reporting strictly follows the Kremlin's propaganda narratives. For example, a recent programme aired by Tavria TV reminded its viewers of the reasons given by Moscow to justify its war against Ukraine. \"Russian President Vladimir Putin says the special military operation was a forced step, because Moscow had been left with no other choice. Such security risks had been created for Russia that no other reaction was possible,\" it said.\n\nOne major obstacle facing Malkevich was an acute shortage of people willing and able to work for his channels.\n\nTo train staff, he opened a \"media school\" in Kherson, became head of the journalism department at the local university and authored a textbook for aspiring media workers in Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine, called \"Real Russian journalism for new regions\".\n\nSome of his students joined his TV stations before becoming legally adults. Two reporters who started working for Za TV and Tavria TV respectively were both employed at the age of just 16. The BBC has chosen not to identify the two girls because of their age.\n\nOne of the teens is known as \"Russia's youngest war reporter\" and got an award from President Vladimir Putin\n\nBut Malkevich's stint in Kherson was short-lived. Shortly before the city was retaken by Ukrainian forces in November, he fled along with some equipment and staff. While evacuating, they came under fire, and one staff member (a Russian journalist and former FSB operative) was killed.\n\nOne of the teen reporters was wounded during the shelling, and was later presented with an Order of Bravery by President Putin at a ceremony in the Kremlin.\n\nMalkevich first rose to relative prominence in 2018, when he launched USA Really - a website set up in the US by RIA FAN, which, in turn, is the most prominent outlet in the stable of propaganda and disinformation media associated with Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Wagner head once dubbed \"Putin's chef\" because he supplied food to the Kremlin.\n\nPRIGOZHIN: From Putin's chef to head of Russia's private army\n\nRIA FAN grew out of Prigozhin's infamous \"troll factory\", which spread pro-Kremlin views across social media and the internet from offices in St Petersburg.\n\nBut USA Really failed to take off, and Malkevich was briefly detained and questioned by the US authorities and later sanctioned for \"facilitating Prigozhin's global influence operations\".\n\nA year after launching USA Really, Malkevich was back in St Petersburg, where he set up another propaganda venture, a foundation, reportedly with a spin doctor linked to Yevgeny Prigozhin.\n\nMelkevich is a close associate of Yevgeny Prigozhin (left), the Wagner chief known as \"Putin's chef\"\n\nThe Foundation for National Values Protection sent a man named Maxim Shugalei to Libya, ostensibly to research public opinion. The same man had been involved the previous year in Russian meddling in presidential elections in Madagascar, which saw one candidate offered a suitcase stuffed with cash, according to a BBC investigation.\n\nWhile in Libya, one of Shugalei's engagements included a meeting with Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, the son of the late deposed leader Col Muammar Gaddafi. Soon afterwards, in May 2019, he was arrested on suspicion of interfering in Libya's affairs on Prigozhin's behalf.\n\nOne Libyan intelligence officer told the BBC: \"If Russia had its way, we would have had Saif Gaddafi giving his victory speech in Tripoli's famous Martyrs' Square.\"\n\nShugalei was freed in December 2020 and claimed in an interview that he had only been released because Prigozhin had sent \"several thousand fighters\" to Tripoli.\n\nWhile in charge of the propaganda foundation, Malkevich also campaigned for the release of Maria Butina, a Russian agent sentenced to 18 months in jail in the US for attempting to infiltrate American political groups.\n\nWhen she returned to Russia, Butina became an \"expert\" at the foundation, and when Shugalei came back from Libyan captivity, he replaced Malkevich as its head.\n\nBut Malkevich's links to Prigozhin's organisations remained. For example, his video programme for RIA FAN, called \"Just A Minute\", continued at least until September 2022, and the latest of his numerous interviews with the outlet is dated February 2023.\n\nMalkevich's work in Ukraine did not go unnoticed by the Russian government. In January 2023, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin rewarded him for \"organising TV broadcasting in territories which are being liberated.\"", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nIsrael has carried out air strikes on Gaza in response to rocket fire from Palestinian militants, as Israeli forces completed their withdrawal from Jenin in the occupied West Bank.\n\nIt follows a major two-day operation inside the city's refugee camp which killed 12 Palestinians.\n\nAn Israeli soldier was also killed on Tuesday night during the withdrawal, which triggered more gun battles.\n\nEarly on Wednesday, the military said it intercepted five rockets from Gaza.\n\nShrapnel from one of the interceptor missiles damaged a house in the southern Israeli town of Sderot.\n\nNo militant group immediately claimed that it was behind the launches, but the Israeli military said fighter jets struck an underground weapons manufacturing facility used by Hamas, which governs Gaza, as well as a raw materials manufacturing facility for rockets.\n\nThe military said it held \"the Hamas terrorist organisation responsible for all terror activities emanating from the Gaza Strip and will face the consequences of security violations against Israel\".\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Hamas described a car-ramming and stabbing attack in the Israeli city of Tel Aviv as a \"natural response\" to the Jenin operation.\n\nIsraeli authorities said seven people were injured on a busy shopping street and that the attacker was a Palestinian man from the West Bank. He was shot dead by a civilian.\n\nIsrael's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said: \"Whoever thinks that such an attack will deter us from continuing our fight against terrorism is mistaken.\"\n\nHe also warned that the Jenin operation would not be a \"one-time action\".\n\n\"We will continue as long as necessary to uproot terrorism. We will not allow Jenin to go back to being a city of refuge for terrorism,\" he added.\n\nPalestinian leaders accused Israel of mounting an \"invasion\" in Jenin.\n\nAn Israeli military spokesman told the BBC on Wednesday morning that \"the operation is officially over, and the soldiers have left the Jenin area\".\n\nThe military launched its operation in Jenin refugee camp early on Monday with a drone strike that it said targeted a joint command centre of the Jenin Brigades - a unit made up of different militant groups, including Hamas.\n\nDrones carried out further air strikes as hundreds of troops entered the camp and engaged in intense gun battles with armed Palestinians inside the camp.\n\nThe military said the \"counter-terrorism operation\" was focused on seizing weapons and \"breaking the safe haven mindset of the camp\".\n\nSeveral thousand Palestinian families fled Jenin refugee camp during the operation\n\nAt a news conference in Geneva on Tuesday, a spokeswoman for the UN's humanitarian office said it was \"alarmed at the scale of air and ground operations that are taking place in Jenin and continuing today in the West Bank, and especially [the] air strikes hitting a densely populated refugee camp\".\n\nShe said the Palestinian health ministry had confirmed that three children - two 17-year-old boys and a 16-year-old boy - were among those killed, and warned that damage to infrastructure meant most of the camp now had no drinking water or electricity.\n\nThe World Health Organization said Palestinian ambulance crews had been prevented from entering parts of the camp, including to reach people who were critically injured. The health ministry has said more than 140 Palestinians have been injured, 30 of them critically.\n\nA Palestinian Red Crescent official said about 3,000 Palestinians, including many sick and elderly, were allowed overnight to flee the drone strikes and gun battles between Israeli troops and armed Palestinians.\n\nA man in a wheelchair who was escorted out of the camp with his family in the morning told the BBC that they had been held in a room by Israeli troops.\n\n\"We were encircled by a military barricade. Israeli soldiers came. Now we just went out. There were no people left in the camp. We were the only ones.\"\n\nHe added: \"It's been a very difficult situation. The drone was shooting at us. Now we've just left. And we're all tired. We've had no food... No drink.\"\n\nOutside a hospital in the nearby city centre, Palestinians protesters threw stones at an Israeli military vehicle, prompting it to fire tear gas in response.\n\nMedical charity M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res complained that paramedics had been forced to proceed on foot because Israeli military bulldozers had destroyed many roads, stripping them of tarmac.\n\nIn an interview with CNN on Tuesday night, chief military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said that no non-combatants had been killed during the operation.\n\nHe also said he had seen ambulances driving freely inside the camp during the day, adding: \"We are assisting those ambulances to evacuate the wounded.\"\n\nThe admiral said bulldozers had dug up about 2km (1.2 miles) of roads inside the camp along which militants had concealed explosive devices, putting civilians and troops at risk.\n\nThe Israeli military says its bulldozers dug up streets to remove explosive devices planted by militants\n\nJenin has become a stronghold of a new generation of Palestinian militants who have become deeply frustrated by the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority's aging leadership and the restrictions of the Israeli occupation.\n\nThe city has seen repeated Israeli military raids in the past year as local Palestinians have carried out deadly attacks on Israelis. Other Palestinian attackers have hidden there.\n\nPalestinian Prime Minister Mohammed Shtayyeh rejected statements from foreign governments saying that Israel had the right to defend itself.\n\n\"Israel is internationally recognised as the occupying power over our land and people,\" he tweeted. \"[It] should be condemned for its use of force to destroy the camp's infrastructure, facilities, and homes, and to kill, arrest, and displace innocent people.\"\n\n\"It is the Palestinian people that have the right to self-defence.

It is definitely not the same colour as it was originally painted - it's an off-white.\n\n\"I feel bullied and that it has now become personal.\"\n\nMs Dickson first received an enforcement notice last year which said her pink door did not meet the standards of a house in the World Heritage Site.\n\nIt stated she must repaint it to its original colour of white or apply for planning permission.\n\nMiranda Dickson says her door is not \"bright pink\" as the complaint letter stated\n\nAfter an appeal failed she applied for planning permission to paint it green.\n\nIn April, before she received the outcome of her application, she painted the door green because she was near the fine deadline if it remained pink.\n\nLast week planners rejected the green colour so she painted it an \"off-white\" and applied again for retrospective planning permission.\n\nBut in a fresh twist the council said it had received a new complaint that the door was again pink.\n\nMs Dickson has previously said she was confused why she was being issued an enforcement notice when there were many other brightly coloured doors in the area.\n\nBut the council said it could only act where it had received a complaint.\n\nMs Dickson says there are other brightly painted doors in her neighbourhood which is a conservation area - her door (before it was repainted) is bottom left\n\nMs Dickson had spent 18 months renovating her childhood home in Drummond Place after her parents died.\n\nThe mother-of-two, who is a brand director in the drinks industry, moved back to Edinburgh two years ago after working in the US for nine years.\n\nShe had been told that she had until 7 January to change the colour of her front door after a complaint led to a council enforcement notice, which she appealed.\n\nMs Dickson said she had looked up the council's guidelines online before she painted the door.\n\nShe said that when she first received a warning letter from the council last year, she asked which colours would be allowed.\n\nMiranda Dickson next to the door when it was repainted green - which was also rejected by planners\n\nThe chief planning officer wrote back telling her to \"stick to traditional colours\" like dark red, dark grey, sage green, dark blue or black.\n\nBut then she received a council enforcement letter in October telling her to paint her door white.\n\n\"It's not like my door is in a bad condition,\" she said.\n\n\"It costs a lot of money to have the front door painted because they are very large.

He is a publicity seeker who has not followed through on previous threats.\n\nRussian troops and fighters from Wagner, a private military company, have been trying to capture Bakhmut for months - despite its questionable strategic value.\n\nWestern officials believe thousands of Russian and Wagner troops have been killed in the fighting, and the eastern Ukrainian city has become a symbolic prize.\n\nYet - although Russian troops and Wagner fighters are on the same side - it is an uneasy alliance.\n\nPrigozhin has regularly criticised Russian officials for what he claims is a lack of front-line support.\n\nIn his new statement, Prigozhin claimed that Gen Sergei Surovikin - who commanded Russia's forces in Ukraine between October and January - had been appointed to liaise between Russia's regular military and Wagner mercenaries.\n\n\"This is the only man with the star of an army general who knows how to fight,\" Prigozhin said. \"No other army general is reasonable.\"\n\nWhile Prigozhin didn't expressly reverse his pledge to withdraw troops from Bakhmut, he said his forces had been given permission to \"act in Bakhmut as we see fit\" - appearing to suggest they will remain.\n\nThe Kremlin has not commented on Prigozhin's latest statement.\n\nWagner has its own set of commanders, objectives and motivations, and Prigozhin is widely believed to hold his own domestic political ambitions.\n\nDefence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov have often been the focus for his anger, amid reports of infighting among different power groups in Vladimir Putin's entourage.\n\nIn his statement on Thursday, Prigozhin raged: \"Shoigu! Gerasimov! Where is the... ammunition?... They came here as volunteers and die for you to fatten yourselves in your mahogany offices.\"\n\nAnd he said Wagner's casualties were \"growing in geometrical progression every day\" because of the lack of ammunition.\n\nAt the time, Ukrainian officials expressed scepticism that Prigozhin truly intended to withdraw his forces from Bakhmut.\n\nDeputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said on Friday that Wagner was actually redeploying mercenaries towards Bakhmut in a bid to capture the city before Tuesday's Victory Day celebrations in Russia.\n\nIn other developments in Ukraine and Russia:", "These buildings in Bakhmut are amongst the thousands destroyed across Ukraine as a result of the war with Russia\n\nUkraine's economy will need external help for many years to come, a senior World Bank official has told the BBC.\n\nThe war-torn country \"also has a lot of potential to turn a lot of its assets into economic opportunity and recovery\", according to Anna Bjerde.\n\nThe managing director for operations was talking before a major international conference in London on rebuilding Ukraine's economy.\n\nLast year the country's economy shrank 29% to just over $140bn (\u00a3109bn).\n\nThe World Bank and other multilateral development bodies are playing a key role in the Ukraine Recovery Conference which is focusing on the role the private sector can play in rebuilding the country.\n\nThe total reconstruction bill was estimated at $411bn in March but continued fighting with Russia means that will now be higher.\n\nThe conference will start on Wednesday, hearing from the co-hosts, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nMr Sunak is set to announce $3bn in World Bank loan guarantees, and will tell the delegates: \"As we've seen in Bakhmut and Mariupol, what Russia cannot take it will seek to destroy. They want to do the same to Ukraine's economy.\"\n\n\"President Zelensky's government is determined to drive reforms to become more open, more transparent and ready for investment.\"\n\nWhen asked about the conference in a BBC interview, Mr Zelensky said: \"On the larger scale we are speaking about the transformation of Ukraine. This is Ukraine not only with its energy and agriculture and industrial complexes, but with its reforms we can see. This is the digitalisation of our country.\"\n\nHe also thanked the UK government and the people for their support of Ukraine since the start of a full-scale invasion by Russia in February 2022.\n\nRishi Sunak and Volodymyr Zelensky, seen meeting at May's G7 summit in Japan, will both address the Ukraine Recovery Conference seeking help for the economy\n\nIn the immediate term Ukraine needs $14bn from international donors to get through this year.\n\nMs Bjerde says this will go towards \"essential social expenditures\" such as pension payments, healthcare and salaries for doctors and teachers. It will also help fund urgent repairs that are needed to infrastructure such as roads and the power system that are crucial for the battered economy to function.\n\nDespite the difficulties that many economies around the world are suffering as a result of the war in Ukraine Ms Bjerde is hopeful that the funding will be forthcoming. \"I think there's been a huge level of commitment shown to Ukraine, and I think that will continue. Ukraine is just too important.\"\n\nThe World Bank's Anna Bjerde says Ukraine will need economic support for many years to come\n\nThe billions of dollars poured in so far have \"helped arrest what otherwise would have been even more devastating humanitarian impacts on the country\", she says, adding that Ukraine will also need to help itself.\n\nThat may prove difficult given that agriculture is a crucial source of income for Ukraine. It is a major global source of crops including wheat, sunflower and corn. Despite a deal to facilitate some exports, which is set to expire next month, output is expected to fall to around 45 million tonnes from 53 million in 2022.\n\nSome of that is because damaged infrastructure makes it harder to get goods out of Ukraine.\n\nUkraine's economy has been held back by Russian attacks on infrastructure such as these rail tracks in Kharkiv\n\nThose challenges have been highlighted in a survey from the American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine (AmCham Ukraine). It shows that 49% of companies have suffered damage to their buildings. It also found that 32% of companies have had staff killed, and 27% staff had injured during 15 months of fighting.\n\nNonetheless it also found 63% of companies intend to invest in new projects, plants or facilities and 74% want to create jobs for Ukrainians in existing projects.\n\nAmCham Ukraine's President Andy Hunder pointed to some of the issues that will be addressed at the conference in London. He told the BBC that \"the majority of businesses in Ukraine don't plan to make claims for war damages until proper and clear compensation mechanisms are developed and eventually implemented\".\n\nCoca-Cola's factory in Kyiv was damaged early in the war but has since been reopened\n\nThe two-day meeting of business leaders and politicians will also look at if a war insurance scheme can be put into place to encourage some of the private sector investment that the World Bank says is vital to rebuilding the economy.\n\nIn a separate survey it found firms have seen an average 53% drop in sales compared with pre-war 2021. It reported that larger companies have suffered more disruption that smaller firms.\n\nWhilst big companies including Coca-Cola, Mondelez and Unilever have seen their buildings damaged some have already started spending money on rebuilding in Ukraine.\n\nFor that to continue Mr Hunder says \"comprehensive war risk insurance for investors has a key role to play to secure investment in Ukraine's rebuilding and recovery\".\n\nMajor US financial firms Blackrock and JP Morgan are helping Ukraine's government secure private sector investment for rebuilding. That will be key to providing the jobs and innovation that will drive Ukraine's recovery according to the World Bank's Ms Bjerde.\n\n\"Even if the war was to end today, there will be an adjustment period, the economy has changed a lot. Poverty in Ukraine has gone up, the dynamics and the demographics have changed. So there will need to be support for the time to come\".", "After losing in a very public way to one of the most famous women in the world, Terry Sanderson has lamented that this trial means he's \"going to be on the internet forever\".\n\nSo who was he before he decided to take on Gwyneth Paltrow?\n\nThe former US army captain and retired optometrist filed suit against Paltrow in 2019, three years after their skiing collision in Utah.\n\nSanderson, 76, says he has never been injured in more than 30 years of skiing.\n\nIn trial, a doctor testified that he led an active retirement.\n\n\u201cTerry had been a high-functioning, active person,\u201d neuroradiology specialist Dr Wendell Gibby told the court. \u201cEvery day he was doing lots of things.

Then they were brought to the UK on a chartered flight and into the arms of waiting relatives.\n\nAs of around 22:00 BST on Wednesday six flights had evacuated 536 British nationals from Sudan, the Foreign Office said.\n\nBut there has been criticism of the slowness of the UK government's evacuations compared with other Western countries such as Germany, which completed its evacuations on Tuesday evening.\n\nHome Secretary Suella Braverman said the government would be supporting British nationals and their dependents, but added there were no plans to introduce a legal route for people fleeing Sudan to claim asylum in the UK.\n\nHowever, Alicia Kearns, chairwoman of the Commons foreign affairs select committee, said elderly people dependent on their British citizen children should be allowed on flights to the UK.\n\n\"In the same way we treat children who are dependent on their parents, we should respect that some elderly people are dependent on their children,\" she said.\n\nClashes between the Sudanese army and paramilitary group the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) began on 15 April.

Or more dramatically could there be options being kept open for last-minute, surprise changes?\n\nThe balcony has become a key moment for the Royal Family to send a message.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, after the procession gets back from Westminster Abbey, the curtains will be pulled back and a number of invited guests will step out on to the palace balcony, looking out over the gates and at the crowd below.\n\nThere has been an expectation this will be used to highlight the core group of \"working royals\" - those family members who carry out official duties on behalf of the King.\n\nAs well as the King and Queen Consort, that would include close family such as the Prince and Princess of Wales, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh and Princess Royal, along with other working royals such as the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester and the Duke of Kent.\n\nThat approach would make a distinction from \"non-working royals\" - specifically Prince Harry and Prince Andrew, who a year ago were banished from the most recent balcony moment, for the late Queen Elizabeth's Platinum Jubilee.\n\nThe balcony line-up of the Royal Family in 2019 for Trooping the Colour\n\nNo such announcement has been made for the Coronation, although it has been confirmed that neither Prince Harry nor Prince Andrew will have any formal role in the ceremony in the Abbey.\n\nFor the Platinum Jubilee in 2022 there were 18 people on the balcony, including the late Queen, and her second appearance on the balcony in the closing moments of the weekend became one of the most poignant images.\n\nNumbers had been cut back even further for the Diamond Jubilee in 2012, when only six people were on the balcony, in a show of frugality at a time of economic austerity.\n\nPrince Harry will be attending the Coronation, and he's expected to make a quick turn-around before returning to the US, but there would be no bigger platform than the balcony for sending an image of a family reunited.\n\nThe balcony, like a framed photo in the royal album, could also be a way of emphasising the line of succession, bringing together the King, Prince William and his son Prince George.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II made six balcony appearances after the coronation\n\nAnother possibility might be several appearances with different line-ups, like the family group permutations of wedding photos.\n\nIn 1953 for the late Queen Elizabeth's coronation there were six separate balcony appearances, with some of these including more than 30 family and friends.\n\nSuch a crowd scene would be unlikely to be the message for a modern monarchy wanting to project a smaller, more cost-conscious image.\n\nMonarchs have been stepping out on to the palace balcony since Queen Victoria in 1851, using it as a showcase where royalty and the public can acknowledge each other.\n\nWinston Churchill was one of the few politicians to appear on the balcony, seen here in 1945\n\nRead the latest from our royal correspondent Sean Coughlan - sign up here.\n\nAlthough it wasn't until the 1930s that the Royal Family began to wave back - and with a leap towards modernity, from the 1980s the balcony became the place where royal weddings were celebrated with a public kiss.\n\nAnd even though there are no fixed rules, the palace balcony has acquired its own rituals. The monarch is almost always at the centre, with others fanning out around them in a courtly pecking order.\n\nTraditionally it's only married partners of the Royal Family who appear, not current girlfriends or boyfriends, suggesting the sense of this being a permanent record.\n\nThis is very much a royal moment, but there have been rare occasions when political figures have appeared.\n\nWartime prime minister Winston Churchill was on the balcony to take the salute of the crowds when victory in Europe was declared in May 1945.\n\nIn 1938 prime minister Neville Chamberlain went on to the balcony after the signing of the ill-fated Munich Agreement with Nazi Germany.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, we'll see who appears beside King Charles and Queen Camilla.\n\nWhat are your plans for the Coronation weekend?

The offence comes under Hong Kong's draconian security law, which was imposed three years ago after widespread pro-democracy protests took place in 2019.\n\nThe UK's Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said the UK would \"not tolerate any attempts by China to intimidate and silence individuals in the UK and overseas.\"\n\n\"We call on Beijing to remove the National Security Law and for the Hong Kong authorities to end their targeting of those who stand up for freedom and democracy,\" he said in a statement.\n\nUnder the national security law, hundreds of pro-democracy campaigners have been arrested and convicted in Hong Kong.\n\nBeijing has said the law is needed to bring stability to the city, but critics say it is designed to squash dissent.\n\nThe eight named in this announcement are all based in the UK, the US and Australia - countries which do not have extradition treaties with China.\n\n\"They have committed very serious offences that endanger national security,\" Steven Li, chief superintendent of the national security department, said.\n\nHe added that while Hong Kong police could not arrest them while they remained abroad, they would not stop chasing them.\n\nMr Law, one of the most prominent figures in the pro-democracy movement, said that while he felt his situation was \"relatively safe\" in the UK, he would have to be more vigilant as a result of the bounty's announcement.\n\n\"There could possibly be someone in the UK - or anywhere else - to provide informations of me to (the Hong Kong authorities).

It makes me have to live in a more careful life.\"\n\nWriting on Twitter, Mr Law urged others not to cooperate with the authorities on the matter and said: \"We should not limit ourselves, self-censor, be intimidated, or live in fear.\"\n\nThis sentiment was echoed by one of the other exiled activists - Anna Kwok, executive director of the Hong Kong Democracy Council - who said the bounty was aimed at intimidating her and her fellow activists.\n\n\"We are united in our fight for freedom and democracy in our home, Hong Kong,\" she said in a statement.\n\nAustralia's Foreign Minister Penny Wong said her government was \"deeply disappointed\" by the announcement and said Australia \"remains deeply concerned by the continuing erosion of Hong Kong's rights, freedoms and autonomy.\"\n\nThe other six activists named in the announcement are Ted Hui, Dennis Kwok, Mung Siu-tat, Elmer Yuen, Finn Law and Kevin Yam.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.", "JavaScript seems to be disabled.

It was scary,\" she said.\n\nKatya said they ended up getting on very well with Danny and they enjoyed their time in Scotland.\n\nShe was able to keep up her hobby of pottery in Danny's house, even passing on some of that knowledge to her daughters.\n\nBut she acknowledged there were difficulties.\n\nShe said: \"It's very difficult for mothers who had a full family in Ukraine before the war, but now they're raising children without the father, who's stayed in Ukraine.\n\n\"It's a really important reason why some people are going home.\"\n\nKatya's partner and son had to stay in Ukraine when the war broke out. Men aged 18 to 60 were not allowed to leave as they were to prepare for service in the armed forces.\n\nShe said her own children were very homesick.\n\n\"They want to study in Ukraine.

We spent a lot of time in shelters under the house waiting for bombs.\"\n\nThere were tears at the emotional reunion - but they could not stop for long. The group then continued through Poland, stopping off in Poznan, before heading towards the border with Ukraine.\n\nOnce they got through the busy vehicle checkpoint, they drove on towards Kyiv on roads that had been bombed and rebuilt.\n\n\"It kind of goes bump bump bump... but they're putting it back together really quickly,\" said Danny.\n\nIt was dark when the van arrived in Kyiv, but there was a welcome party waiting for their arrival.\n\nKatya's mother Nadia, partner Dima and son Leo now live in the city, and were there to greet them, clearly relieved to be reunited after nine months apart.", "Mahek Bukhari (right) and her mother Ansreen are on trial with six others\n\nA social media influencer accused of murdering two men \"told a pack of lies\" to police over her involvement in the crash that killed them, a court heard.\n\nMohammed Hashim Ijazuddin and Saqib Hussain, both 21, died on the A46 in Leicestershire in February 2022.\n\nMahek Bukhari, 23, her mother Ansreen Bukhari, 46, and six others are charged with their murder.\n\nThe prosecution said the group rammed the pair off the road to keep an affair between Ansreen and Mr Hussain secret.\n\nAll eight defendants deny two counts of murder and an alternative charge of manslaughter.\n\nProsecutor Collingwood Thompson KC told Leicester Crown Court Mahek Bukhari had been elusive when questioned about the fatal crash.\n\n\"Far from telling the police the truth, she told a pack of lies,\" he said.\n\n\"As a social media influencer, she no doubt hoped that her skills would enable her to sell a false story to the police.\"\n\nMohammed Hashim Ijazuddin (left) and Saqib Hussain died at the scene\n\nAt the opening of the retrial on Monday, the prosecution said Mr Hussain had been blackmailing his former lover with sexual videos and images from their affair.\n\nIt is claimed the defendants enticed him and his friend Mr Ijazuddin to Leicester for a meeting before ramming their car off the road, causing both men's deaths.\n\nOn Tuesday, the court heard after the crash at 01:35 GMT on 11 February, police worked with other forces to trace the Audi TT and Seat Leon the prosecution says were involved.\n\nThe jury was shown bodycam footage of officers visiting the Bukharis at their home in George Eardley Close, Stoke-on-Trent, about eight hours after the crash, having traced the Audi TT.\n\nThis came hours after co-defendant Natasha Akhtar, the owner of the Seat Leon, was arrested on her way back to her home in Birmingham.\n\nMr Thompson KC said while her brother was being asked about the car, Mahek Bukhari had a 14-minute call with co-defendant Raees Jamal.\n\nMahek Bukhari has denied two counts of murder\n\n\"It's not difficult to infer that Mahek Bukhari picked up on the fact that Raees Jamal had been trying to call her and she must've been telling him the police were in the house,\" the barrister said.\n\n\"He said Natasha Akhtar had been arrested and they were trying cobble some sort of story to deceive police.\"\n\nOnce it was established the pair had been in the Audi TT, Ms Bukhari claimed to officers she and her mother had been to Nottingham, which Mr Thompson KC said \"was a lie\".\n\nThe women were asked to hand over their phones and pin numbers.\n\nHowever, Mahek Bukhari gave a false pin number and when officers tried to unlock it, her phone had reverted back to its factory settings with the data cleared, the court was told.\n\nDetectives later retrieved messages and call logs from her phone after accessing her iCloud account, the court heard.\n\nBoth were arrested and transferred to Leicester to be interviewed under caution.\n\nCollingwood Thompson KC said Mahek Bukhari told a number of lies to police in interview\n\nThe barrister said Mahek told police the pair had been intending to travel to Nottingham but ended up in Leicester due to roadworks.\n\nWhen asked about Mr Hussain, the influencer claimed she had known him for three years and had his number as they had previously dated.\n\nShe then claimed he had been harassing and bullying her through her social media channels and demanded money to stop, explaining this was why they came to meet him at a Tesco car park in Hamilton, Leicester.\n\nOn the crash itself, she claimed the Skoda Fabia Mr Hussain and Mr Ijazuddin were in was \"harassing\" the blue Seat Leon but she did not see the impact.\n\nShe added she was \"praying and hoping\" the people inside the silver car were OK and \"burst into tears\".\n\n(From front left) Ansreen Bukhari, Mahek Bukari, Rekan Karwan, Raees Jamal with (from top left) Ameer Jamal, Sanaf Gulammustafa, Natasha Akhtar and Mohammed Patel\n\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, or on Instagram.

where he has been chief executive since 1999 and is responsible for the day-to-day running of the SNP.\n\nTwo leadership candidates, Kate Forbes and Ash Regan, have questioned the independence of the election process.\n\nAnd on Friday, the SNP's head of media at Holyrood, Murray Foote, resigned, saying there were \"serious issues\" with statements he had issued in \"good faith\" on behalf of party headquarters.\n\nA National Executive Committee source told the BBC Mr Foote had been \"thrown under the bus\" by Peter Murrell.\n\nMr Murrell has been married to Ms Sturgeon since 2010.\n\nThe SNP leader said her husband was right to resign.\n\nShe told Sky News Mr Murrell had \"obviously taken responsibility for the recent issue with membership\".\n\nMs Sturgeon added: \"He had intended to step down when there was a new leader but I think he was right to make that announcement today [Saturday].\n\n\"Peter has been a key part of the electoral success we have achieved in recent years and I know there will be a recognition of that across the party.\"\n\nIn his resignation statement Mr Murrell said: \"Responsibility for the SNP's responses to media queries about our membership number lies with me as chief executive.\n\n\"While there was no intent to mislead, I accept that this has been the outcome.\n\n\"I have therefore decided to confirm my intention to step down as chief executive with immediate effect.\"\n\nHe said he had not planned to step down until after the leadership contest but recognised that he had become \"a distraction from the campaign\".\n\n\"I have concluded that I should stand down now, so the party can focus fully on issues about Scotland's future,\" he said.\n\nMr Murrell has been married to Nicola Sturgeon since 2010\n\nMr Murrell added that he had no role in the running of the election contest.\n\n\"I have worked for independence all my life and will continue to do so, albeit in a different capacity, until it is achieved - and I do firmly believe that independence is now closer than ever,\" he said.\n\nSNP leadership candidate Kate Forbes said: \"I think that the party owes Peter Murrell a great debt of gratitude because he oversaw the party's expansion in membership and he's been the reason we won so many elections with his leadership at the top.\n\n\"I've said repeatedly from the beginning of this contest that I think there's an appetite for fresh faces and that will hopefully pave the way for new people in headquarters to be able to run the SNP in a way that maintains the trust of SNP members and supports the SNP in government.\"\n\nMs Forbes added that despite having called for an independent auditor to oversee the leadership vote, she had \"no concerns\" about Peter Murrell.\n\nThis is a miserable end to Peter Murrell's long career in charge of SNP headquarters where he helped turn the party into a successful election-winning machine.\n\nHe is taking responsibility for the party misleading the media about a big fall in the SNP's membership but concerns about his stewardship go wider than that.\n\nTwo leadership candidates called for an independent auditor to be appointed to oversee the election although Mr Murrell insists he had \"no role in it at any point\".\n\nThere is an ongoing police investigation into how \u00a3600,000 raised by the party for independence campaigning has been spent - with the SNP denying any wrongdoing.\n\nSome members of the party's ruling body were threatening a vote of no confidence in the chief executive, with one telling the BBC he had become a \"hindrance\".\n\nOthers in the SNP have long questioned the wisdom of the party being run by Nicola Sturgeon's husband - arguing that too much power has been concentrated in one household.\n\nHumza Yousaf, another SNP leadership hopeful said: \"Peter Murrell has been an outstanding servant of the independence movement and the SNP.\n\n\"As I have said repeatedly throughout this campaign, he is the most electorally successful chief executive of any party in the UK and the SNP has been lucky to have him. Our election wins from 2007 to 2021 owe much to his political abilities.\n\nMr Yousaf added that he agreed it was time for Mr Murrell to stand down.\n\n\"With less than 10 days to go in this leadership contest, it is vital we all focus on the policies and vision we have for the party, movement and country,\" he said.\n\nParty leadership candidate Ash Regan posted on Twitter: \"Eight years ago was the point where it was unacceptable to have the husband of the party leader as the CEO.\n\n\"I am encouraged to see the democratic foundations of the party now asserting their rightful function.\"\n\nShe added that the SNP's foundations were based on accountability, transparency, modernity and accessibility.\n\nSNP business convener Kirsten Oswald said she had called an National Executive Committee meeting on Saturday which had reaffirmed the body's faith in the leadership election process.\n\nQuestions have mounted over a loan of more than \u00a3100,000 that Mr Murrell gave to the party in June 2021 to help it out with a \"cash flow\" issue after the last election.\n\nScottish Conservative chairman Craig Hoy MSP said: \"A fish rots from the head down - and the same applies to the SNP.\n\n\"Peter Murrell's resignation is long overdue - but there remain serious questions for him to answer, not least over the 'missing' \u00a3600,000 from party accounts.\"\n\nHe added: \"The brutal, shambolic SNP leadership election appears to have been the tipping point that's forced the first minister's husband to quit before he was pushed.\"\n\nMr Hoy said Mr Murrell must fully co-operate with any probes into the way the leadership election had been run and the police inquiry into the SNP's finances.\n\nIn recent months, Ms Sturgeon was repeatedly asked about the origin of finances used by her husband but said the funds were entirely his own and she could not recall when she first learned of it.\n\nThe SNP has also been under investigation over the past 18 months after questions were raised about the fate of \u00a3600,000 that was raised from supporters in 2017 for the purposes of a future referendum campaign.\n\nAn SNP spokesman said the loan was a \"personal contribution made by the chief executive to assist with cash flow after the Holyrood election\".\n\nScottish Labour deputy leader Jackie Baillie said: \"This latest resignation of a top SNP figure goes to show that the wheels have fallen off the SNP wagon. When Scotland most needs responsible governance, the SNP has turned inward and begun to tear itself apart. \"If this is what is happening in the party, just imagine the chaos in government.\"\n\nThe ballot to find a replacement for Ms Sturgeon, which uses the single transferable vote system, opened on Monday with the winner to be announced on 27 March.", "The boss of one of the UK's largest business groups has been fired over complaints about his behaviour at work.\n\nTony Danker, who will leave the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) following an investigation over his conduct towards several employees, said he was \"shocked\" by the sacking.\n\nThree other CBI employees have also been suspended pending a probe into other allegations, the group said.\n\nIt is also liaising with the police who are looking into the claims.\n\nDetective Chief Superintendent Richard Waight of the City of London Police said: \"We approached the CBI following media reports and our investigations are at a very early stage. It would not be appropriate to comment any further at this time.\"\n\nMr Danker stepped aside in March after the CBI hired law firm Fox Williams to investigate several complaints about him. These included a complaint from a female employee in January and complaints from other members of staff which surfaced in March.\n\nThe 51-year-old, who was paid \u00a3376,000 by the CBI in 2021, has now been dismissed with immediate effect with no severance pay. He is being replaced by Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI's former chief economist.\n\nMr Danker tweeted on Tuesday: \"I recognise the intense publicity the CBI has suffered following the revelations of awful events that occurred before my time in office. I was appalled to learn about them for the first time last week.\n\n\"I was nevertheless shocked to learn this morning that I had been dismissed from the CBI, instead of being invited to put my position forward as was originally confirmed. Many of the allegations against me have been distorted, but I recognise that I unintentionally made a number of colleagues feel uncomfortable and I am truly sorry about that. I want to wish my former CBI colleagues every success.\"\n\nThe findings of the investigation into him for now remain unpublished.\n\nLast week, the Guardian newspaper reported sexual misconduct claims against CBI employees, including an allegation of rape at a summer boat party in 2019.\n\nMany of the most serious allegations predate Mr Danker's time as director-general.\n\nBelfast-born Mr Danker took over as head of the CBI in November 2020. He had previously spent 10 years as a consultant with McKinsey, and worked as a special adviser to the Treasury under Gordon Brown's government. He has also been international director then chief strategy officer at Guardian News and Media.\n\nIn its statement on Tuesday, the CBI said: \"Tony Danker is dismissed with immediate effect following the independent investigation into specific complaints of workplace misconduct against him.\n\n\"The board wishes to make clear he is not the subject of any of the more recent allegations in The Guardian but has determined that his own conduct fell short of that expected of the director-general.\"\n\nThe scandals have left the CBI facing its biggest crisis since it was founded in 1965.\n\nSome company executives who are members of the group have described it as an existential crisis for an organisation that represents the interests of some 190,000 businesses across the UK.\n\nThe lobby group has already postponed its public events and asked Fox Williams to conduct a separate investigation to the one into Mr Danker.\n\nA Downing Street spokesman said the government would keep its engagement with the CBI on hold while the group continued its investigation, adding: \"We continue to expect any allegations to be taken seriously and for appropriate action to be taken in response.\"\n\nLabour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said Labour had also cut ties with the CBI for now, calling the allegations \"incredibly concerning\".\n\nIn its statement, the lobby group said the allegations made in recent weeks had been \"devastating\" and that there had been \"serious failings\" in how it had handled sexual misconduct complaints. It said it would now begin a \"root-and-branch review\" of its culture and governance.\n\nThis will look at issues such as how employees raise concerns and processes for escalating complaints.\n\n\"It is already clear to all of us that there have been serious failings in how we have acted as an organisation. We must do better, and we must be better,\" it said.\n\nMr Danker's replacement, Rain Newton-Smith, becomes the second woman to lead the group in its history.\n\nMs Newton-Smith, who spent her early career as an economist at the Bank of England, left the CBI in March to join Barclays bank as managing director for strategy and policy, sustainability and ESG (environmental, social and governance).\n\nShe is well known to CBI staff and members but will face a tough job in reassuring members that the lobby group can effectively represent their interests.\n\nJ\u00fcrgen Maier, the former UK boss of engineering giant Siemens, said Mr Danker's sacking should be a \"wake up moment\" for all business leaders.\n\nMr Maier, who served on the CBI's president's committee until 2019, told Radio 4's World at One programme: \"For any leader this is a wake up moment to make sure that we do root and branch reviews of our organisation and make sure that we've got the cultures in place that don't allow these sorts of behaviours to happen.\"\n\nLast week the boss of brewing company Adnams said his firm had considered leaving the CBI following the scandals.\n\nOn Tuesday, chief executive Andy Wood said a decision would not be made until the full investigation was complete, but added he was encouraged by the action taken.\n\n\"The allegations were very serious and there's clearly no room for that type of behaviour in any workplace,\" he told the BBC.\n\n\"So it was right that we reviewed [our membership], but it's also right we give the organisation a chance to put its house back in order.\"\n\nThe CBI lobbies politicians on firms' behalf to make policies that benefit UK businesses. It also hosts regular networking events for business leaders, with the UK chancellor typically giving the keynote speech at its annual dinner.\n\nAccording its most recently published accounts, \u00a322m of its \u00a325m income in 2021 came from membership fees.", "Meta has launched its much-teased rival to Twitter, Threads, in the UK and US. The BBC's technology editor Zoe Kleinman and North America technology correspondent James Clayton have both tried out the app. Here are their first impressions.\n\nIt was the middle of the night in the UK when my phone buzzed to let me know that Meta Threads, the new social network app I'd pre-ordered on the App Store, had been installed.\n\nGiven the timing, I wasn't expecting much to be going on from a UK location. I already have an Instagram account so within three clicks I had a profile, and I selected to follow everybody I already follow on the photo-sharing app.\n\nSuddenly it was like I'd walked through the door to a great big house party. Loads of people were signing up, writing their first posts, responding to others and commenting on the new surroundings.\n\nI had dozens of followers in the first five minutes, and nearly 500 as I write this. (I've still got fewer than 300 on another Twitter alternative, the Jack Dorsey-founded text-based network, BlueSky, which I've been on for weeks.)\n\nIf you're familiar with Twitter, you'll recognise the design of Threads instantly. Everything from the heart-shaped symbol to \"like\" a post, to the circle of arrows denoting the feature to repost, is the same.\n\nSome early complaints include the lack of a private messaging feature, no hashtags or trends to help navigate popular content, and no timeline curation options other than the ability to mute accounts or words, and block others.\n\nBut I feel we should add the word \"yet\" - Threads is officially only a few hours old (although it is its second outing following an earlier version in 2019 that was discontinued. Perhaps the world wasn't yet ready, or sufficiently annoyed with the goings on at Twitter).\n\nWhat stands it apart from other Twitter rivals is the instant integration of this vast, ready-made Instagram community. Two billion people use the photo-sharing app and this offers an easy way for them all to land on another platform.\n\nThis makes it instantly engaging, which will appeal hugely to advertisers, who I imagine will eventually fund it, although there will apparently be no ads for the first year.\n\nFirst impressions of Threads: can Meta do this? Is this not somehow plagiarism?\n\nThe app looks almost identical to Twitter. The news feed, the reposting. It's all incredibly familiar.\n\nMark Zuckerberg claims millions of people have signed up in the first few hours. You should always be sceptical when a tech boss says how many users have signed up to a platform. But it does feel like a lot of people are already on it.\n\nThat's partly because it's connected to Instagram. Meta isn't creating an app from scratch. It's benefiting from its two billion Instagram followers that are giving it a massive shot in the arm.\n\nPlatforms like Bluesky and Mastodon did not have this luxury. They started with zero users.\n\nBut whether this is \"fair\" or not, Mr Zuckerberg doesn't care. He's copied other apps before to great success (Reels is a clone of TikTok) and he's happy to do so again.\n\nKnowing the power of celebrity, Mr Zuckerberg has also utilised famous names on Instagram and managed to get some of them on Threads, like Shakira and Gordon Ramsay.\n\nMr Zuckerberg will be thrilled with the buzz around the app. When it comes to social media, it's all about the network effect. The more people use the app, the better the app is.\n\nWhen it comes to social media, the network effect can create a sort of tipping point. When so many of your friends or people you want to hear from are on a platform, you kind of feel you have to join.\n\nIt's very, very hard to create a network effect on a social media platform. But when it works, it really works. The reverse is also true. When communities leave a social media platform, they can do so quickly - and it can be devastating. Think Myspace or Bebo.\n\nLet's go to some of the problems with Threads, though.\n\nUnlike Twitter, which has two feeds - a recommendations feed and an option just to see tweets from those you follow - Threads has just one feed that blends your followers and content it thinks you will want. That could get annoying.\n\nIt doesn't seem to have desktop functionality yet - it doesn't work well on your computer. That's a shame.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be any trending information, so it's hard to see what's going viral.\n\nAnd when it comes to verification, users can still buy their blue ticks for a monthly fee, just as you can with Twitter.\n\nMark Zuckerberg described the app as an \"initial version\" - and that's what it feels like. It does the basics well. But this is a no-thrills app right now.\n\nThat said, Meta's boss will be over the moon with how this has gone so far. Considering the bad press he's got over the years, he is reinventing himself as the adult in the room - the sensible tech billionaire who wants a friendly social media platform.\n\nYou can tell this has riled Elon Musk. \"Thank goodness they're so sanely run,\" he tweeted sarcastically on Monday.\n\nBut if Mr Zuckerberg was nervous that disaffected Twitter uses would spurn Meta's offer, so far, it looks like those fears were unfounded.\n\nAnd if that is the case, with an app that works perfectly well, if not spectacularly, that could be a real problem for Mr Musk.", "Wild Youth have previously toured with Niall Horan and Lewis Capaldi and were chosen to represent Ireland in February\n\nIreland's Eurovision act Wild Youth have cut ties with their creative director over comments made on social media relating to transgender people.\n\nScreen grabs circulated on Twitter of Ian Banham's account referring to transgender women as men in posts.\n\nThe Irish band say they stand for \"unity and kindness\" and will no longer let Mr Banham \"near our team\".\n\nMr Banham's representatives have been contacted by the BBC, but they had no comment to make.\n\nWith just two weeks until this year's song contest begins, it is quite late for any artist to change their creative team as rehearsals begin in Liverpool next week.\n\nWild Youth frontman Conor O'Donohoe said he \"felt sick\" reading the tweets and apologised to those hurt by those remarks.\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

My main focus is how we can create a new Yes movement that allows for different visions but conducted in an atmosphere of mutual trust.\"\n\nPolice officers carried boxes out of SNP headquarters following the search\n\nMr Russell said there would be a wide-ranging review of the SNP's governance and transparency.\n\nThis was promised by Mr Yousaf, who was sworn in as first minister last week.\n\nMr Russell said he would support Mr Yousaf, who positioned himself as the \"continuity candidate\" in the leadership race.\n\nHe said: \"I'll do as much as I can, but it's true that the last few weeks have been pretty wearing.

That's the way it's got to be.\"\n\nPolice Scotland launched a formal investigation into the SNP's finances in July 2021 after receiving complaints about how donations were used.\n\nQuestions had been raised about the use of over \u00a3600,000 fundraised by the party for a fresh independence referendum campaign.\n\nMr Russell said he would help new party leader Humza Yousaf as much as he could\n\nLast year it emerged that Mr Murrell gave a loan of more than \u00a3100,000 to the SNP to help it out with a \"cash flow\" issue after the last election. The party had repaid about half of the money by October of that year.\n\nAt the time an SNP spokesman said the loan was a \"personal contribution made by the chief executive to assist with cash flow after the Holyrood election\".\n\nHe said it had been reported in the party's 2021 accounts, which were published by the Electoral Commission in August last year.\n\nMr Murrell resigned as the party's chief executive last month after taking responsibility for misleading statements about a fall in party membership. He had held the post since 1999.\n\nOn Friday, it emerged that the accountancy firm which audits the SNP's finances had resigned after working with the party for a decade.\n\nAccountants Johnston Carmichael informed the party of the decision before Mr Murrell's arrest.\n\nThe party's treasurer is now seeking another auditor in order to comply with Electoral Commission rules.\n\nThe SNP is required to prepare financial statements to comply with the Political Parties, Elections and Referendum Act 2000. It has until 7 July to present their accounts to the Electoral Commission.\n\nIf there is no report and no reasonable excuse, the commission has the power to appoint its own firm of auditors.\n\nIt was with huge understatement that Humza Yousaf accepted the SNP was having a \"difficult day\" on Wednesday as police searched the party's headquarters and arrested its former chief executive.\n\nMike Russell offers a reality check in describing the situation as a \"crisis\" bigger and more challenging than any he has seen the SNP face in 50 years.\n\nMr Russell is not just any party member. He is one of the architects of the modern SNP. A former chief executive. The man brought in to provide stability when his successor in that role - Peter Murrell - resigned during the leadership contest.\n\nPerhaps the least surprising comment he makes is that he does not think independence can be secured right now. That is fairly obvious, not least because there is no agreed route to doing so.\n\nThat is before you consider the potential negative impact the turmoil in his party could have on its standing with Scottish voters - with recent polls suggesting the SNP's popularity had already begun to dip.", "Mr Webber's parents spoke at a vigil held at his home cricket club in Somerset\n\nThe parents of student Barnaby Webber who was stabbed to death in Nottingham on Tuesday have described him as \"a lovely soul\" during a vigil near his Somerset home.\n\nMr Webber, 19, died in attacks in which fellow student Grace O'Malley-Kumar, also 19, and school caretaker Ian Coates, 65, were killed.\n\nSupport from \"his tribe\" there was a source of strength, his parents said.\n\n\"It's overwhelming the outpouring of love and support,\" Mr Webber's mother Emma Webber explained. \"This is his true home, his people.\n\n\"Today we wanted to come and see what this wonderful club has done for him.

Watch: President Zelensky shared a video of the dam on Telegram\n\nThousands of people are being evacuated downstream of a major dam which has collapsed in Russian-held Ukraine.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky said 80 towns and villages may be flooded after the destruction of the dam at Nova Kakhovka, which he blamed on Russia.\n\nWater is surging down the Dnipro river, and is said to pose a catastrophic flooding risk to the city of Kherson.\n\nRussia has denied destroying the dam - which it controls - instead blaming Ukrainian shelling.\n\nNeither Ukraine nor Russia's claim has been verified by the BBC.\n\nThe Kakhovka dam, downstream from the huge Kakhovka reservoir, is crucial to the region.\n\nIt provides water to farmers and residents, as well as to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. It is also a vital channel carrying water south to Russian-occupied Crimea.\n\nUkraine's state-owned hydropower plants administrator Ukrhydroenergo warned that the peak of a water spill downstream from the emptying reservoir was expected on Wednesday morning.\n\nIt said this would be followed by a period of \"stabilisation\", with the water expected to rapidly recede in four to five days.\n\nThere are concerns about the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant - Europe's largest - which uses reservoir water for cooling.\n\nThe situation there is said to be under control and there is \"no immediate nuclear safety risk\" for the plant, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\n\nVideo footage shows a torrent of floodwater gushing through a breach in the dam. Several towns are already flooded, while people in areas further downstream have been forced to flee by bus and train.\n\nAbound 40,000 people need to be evacuated, Deputy Prosecutor-General Viktoriya Lytvynova said on Ukrainian television - 17,000 people in Ukraine-controlled territory west of the Dnipro River and 25,000 on the Russian-controlled east.\n\nAlso speaking on Ukrainian television, Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said about 1,000 people had been evacuated so far and 24 settlements had been flooded.\n\nHe accused Russia of shelling the southern region of Kherson, from where people were being evacuated, and issued a warning about the dangers posed by mines being exposed by the rising water levels.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. A building is seen floating along the Dnipro river in the Kherson region\n\nOne local resident Andriy, who lives close to the dam - which was seized by Russian forces shortly after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022 - said he believed Russia wanted to \"drown\" his city.\n\nIn the Ukraine-controlled city of Kherson, a woman called Lyudmyla - who was loading her belongings including a washing machine onto a trailer that was attached to an old car - said: \"We're afraid of flooding. We're taking our things a little higher up.\"\n\nShe called for Russian forces to be \"kicked out of here... they're shooting at us. They're flooding us or doing something else\".\n\nAnother resident of the city, Serhiy, said he feared \"everything is going to die here\".\n\n\"All the living creatures, and people will be flooded out,\" he said, gesturing at nearby houses and gardens.\n\nThe city of Kherson is 50 miles downstream of the dam\n\nOn the Russian-seized riverbank of Nova Kakhovka, the Moscow-installed mayor Vladimir Leontyev said the city was underwater and 900 people had been evacuated.\n\nHe said 53 evacuation buses were being sent by the authorities to take people from the city and two other settlements nearby to safety.\n\nWater levels had risen to over 11m (36ft) and some residents had been taken to hospital, he added.\n\nThe small town of Oleshky was also heavily flooded, Kremlin-appointed officials said.\n\nThe Kazkova Dibrova zoo on the Russian-held riverbank had been completely flooded and all 300 animals were dead, it said in a post on its Facebook page.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nIt is not yet clear what caused the breach in the dam in the early hours of Tuesday, but Ukraine's military intelligence has accused Russia of deliberately blowing it up.\n\nThis seems plausible, as Moscow may have feared that Ukrainian forces would use the road over the dam to advance into Russian-held territory, as part of their counter-offensive.\n\nFor Russia, anxious to defend conquered territory in southern Ukraine, the dam represented an obvious problem.\n\nJust as Ukrainian forces attacked road and rail bridges further downstream last autumn in a successful effort to isolate Russian forces in and around Kherson, Russia may have decided to destroy the dam to hold up Ukraine's counter-offensive, which it fears could come from multiple directions.\n\nHowever, a Russian official claims Ukraine carried out the attack on the dam to detract from what they said were the failures of its counter-offensive and to deprive Crimea - Ukraine's southern peninsula illegally annexed by Russian in 2014 - of fresh water.\n\nA major Ukrainian push has long been expected. Kyiv has said it would not give advance warning of its start but a recent increase in military activity is being seen as a fresh sign that the counter-offensive may have begun.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, President Zelensky said the dam destruction would not stop Ukraine. \"We will still liberate all our land,\" he said in a video address.\n\nEarlier in the day, Mr Zelensky held an urgent meeting of the country's security and defence council to discuss the issue.\n\nAn aerial image shows water pouring through what appears to be a breach in the dam\n\nOn Monday, Ukraine's deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said Ukrainian forces had advanced around the \"epicentre of hostilities\" in Bakhmut, but did not say whether the counter-offensive had begun.\n\nBakhmut has for months been at the heart of fierce fighting. It has little strategic value - but is important symbolically both for Kyiv and Moscow.\n\nYuri Sak, an adviser to Ukraine's ministry of defence, told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme that phone intercepts suggest Russia wants to target more dams.\n\n\"They're actually calling to blow up more dams on the Dnipro river,\" he said.\n\nUkraine has branded the attack on the dam \"ecocide\" and said that 150 tonnes of engine oil has spilled into the Dnipro river.\n\nUkrhydroenergo said a power station linked to the dam had been \"completely destroyed... the hydraulic structure is being washed away\".\n\nWorld leaders have laid the blame for the blast at Russia's door, with some calling it a war crime.\n\nUK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said that if Russia was found to be responsible for the collapse of the dam it would \"demonstrate the new lows that we will have seen from Russian aggression\".\n\nThe head of Nato, Jens Stoltenberg, said the destruction of the dam demonstrated once again the brutality of Russia's war in Ukraine, while Charles Michel, the president of the European Council, said he was \"shocked by the unprecedented attack\".\n\nThe Geneva Conventions explicitly ban targeting dams in war due to the danger it poses to civilians.", "Fourth LV= Insurance Ashes Test, Emirates Old Trafford (day two of five):\n\nZak Crawley's astonishing 189 stunned Australia and kept England on course for an Ashes comeback on an exhilarating second day of the fourth Test at Old Trafford.\n\nCrawley cracked the highest score by an England batter in a home Ashes Test for 26 years to give the hosts the perfect chance of levelling the series at 2-2.\n\nIn a 182-ball stay, he crunched 21 fours and three sixes to help England to 384-4, a lead of 67.\n\nCrawley shared a stand of 121 with Moeen Ali, who was superb in making 54 at number three, then a riotous double-century partnership with Joe Root, the former captain unlucky to fall for 84.\n\nThough Crawley and Root were both bowled by deliveries that kept low, Harry Brook and Ben Stokes laid a platform to attack on Friday morning with an unbroken stand of 33.\n\nOn a perfect day for the home side, James Anderson removed Pat Cummins with the first ball of the morning and Chris Woakes completed his maiden five-wicket haul in an Ashes Test to dismiss Australia for 317.\n\nWith the series on the line and bad weather closing in at the weekend, England not only wanted to build a lead, but do so swiftly enough to leave time to force a result.\n\nThey did so in a fashion that was barely believable and now have a golden opportunity to level the series at 2-2 and set up a delicious Ashes decider at The Oval.\n\u2022 None England aiming to bat once in fourth Test - Crawley\n\u2022 None How a staggering day two at Old Trafford unfolded\n\u2022 None Quiz: Name players to have 3,000 runs and 200 wickets in Tests\n\nEven the most optimistic England fan could not have predicted this. Their day-one performance with the ball, reducing Australia to 299-8, created the prospect of one good batting innings levelling the series. There was also the danger of one collapse surrendering any chance of lifting the urn.\n\nWhat transpired was England's best day of the summer - a celebration of everything good about the cricket they have played under Stokes and Brendon McCullum, lapped up by the Old Trafford Party Stand.\n\nIf Australia were yet to be fully Bazballed, they have now, steamrollered by Crawley and co in a trail of destruction that scattered fielders, frazzled minds and did horrific damage to bowling figures. Off-spinner Todd Murphy, the notable absentee from the Australia XI, would have been relieved to be running drinks rather than bowling.\n\nTo compound an awful day for the tourists, fast bowler Mitchell Starc struggled with a hamstring injury then hurt his left shoulder diving in the field.\n\nAnderson had Cummins caught at cover while Woakes needed two goes at having number 11 Josh Hazlewood caught in the slips - the first was a no-ball. It proved to be the only blight on England's day.\n\nWith heavy rain forecast for Saturday and Sunday, England knew they had to score quickly. They did so with controlled aggression, glorious strokeplay and urgent running. The hosts could feel in a position to have Australia batting again before lunch on Friday.\n\nAny tilt at victory will have to come with the weather looming and on a pitch starting to show some signs of sharp variable bounce.\n\nBut England have engineered a huge opening. They have never returned from 2-0 down to win an Ashes series. The comeback is on.\n\nDespite his modest record, England have always believed Kent's Crawley is a match-winner. This innings, an Ashes knock for the ages, was spectacular vindication.\n\nEngland were nervy in the spell to lunch. Ben Duckett edged Starc behind for one and Crawley had to overturn being given out lbw to Cameron Green on 20.\n\nBut Crawley and makeshift number three Moeen intelligently built their century partnership and Crawley exploded into life after the break.\n\nWith flamboyant whips, handsome drives and some mighty slog sweeps, Crawley eviscerated the Australian bowling. He moved from 50 to 100 in 26 balls, a 93-ball ton England's fourth-fastest in Ashes cricket.\n\nCrawley crashed 106 runs from 82 balls in the session between lunch and tea. A stand of 206 with Root was racked up in only 186 deliveries. The Australians rifled through plan and after plan, their fielding became ragged and bowlers weary.\n\nJust as Crawley looked primed for a double ton, Green got one to keep low and he played on, leaving to rapturous applause from a crowd who had witnessed one of the all-time great hundreds.\n\nThis was a superb effort from Moeen, who came out of retirement for this series and finds himself as the only frontline spinner in the match and filling an important gap in the England order.\n\nHe batted with composure and displayed the odd touch of style. The standing ovation for reaching his first Test half-century in four years recognised Moeen's selfless service this summer. He was unlucky that a full-blooded pull off Starc was sharply taken by Usman Khawaja.\n\nRoot arrived with the score at 130-2 and the game in the balance, but was instantly at his impish, imperious best.\n\nHe dealt with Australia's short-ball plan by expertly executing hooks and pulls. His intent to score brought 40 off his first 30 balls - Root's fastest-ever start to a Test innings. He played his trademark reverse-scoops off Mitchell Marsh and Cummins.\n\nRoot deserved a century of his own, only to be bowled by a scuttler from Hazlewood - keeping even lower than the one that got Crawley.\n\nThe way in which Brook and Stokes calmly played for the morning is ominous for the Australians. The sight of 'nighthawk' Stuart Broad padded up late in the day was a sign of England's intent.\n\nEngland opener Zak Crawley, speaking to Test Match Special: \"I rode my luck at times and played some really good parts in the innings and there were other parts where I was really streaky but I'm happy with how I have played. It was a special day.\n\n\"I just keep backing my game and I've done that well this series where I just keep trying to play the way I play. That's the only way that is going to work for me.\"\n\nAustralia assistant coach Daniel Vettori: \"It was obviously a taxing session because Crawley was so dominant and played so well from the onset. We had some clear plans but he was too good.\"\n\nFormer England captain Michael Vaughan: \"England play a certain brand that completely suits Crawley. That innings has put England on the front foot and this moment will be spoken about for a long period of time, particularly if England go on to win the Ashes.\"", "Wallace will be forgiven for his frankness\n\nUK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace\u2019s remarks about Ukraine needing to be more grateful should be seen in context. He was not voicing frustration or anger. He was instead suggesting Kyiv needed to be more politically savvy. He was saying Ukrainian officials should understand more about the internal politics of their allies, particularly the United States. They should not be surprised, he suggested, there were a few \u201cgrumbles\u201d on Capitol Hill if they turned up in Washington with a shopping list of weapons, as if the US government were like a branch of Amazon. They should understand, Wallace said, they were asking some countries to give up the bulk of their ammunition stocks. So Wallace\u2019s remarks were like a parent telling a child to remember to write a thank-you letter to a relative so they get a present next year too. It might not have been very diplomatic for him to say this in the middle of a summit designed to emphasise Nato unity. But Wallace is known for his outspoken support for Ukraine and his efforts to send Western military arms and ammunition to the country - so he will probably be forgiven for his frankness, which will come as no surprise to Britain\u2019s allies.", "Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic rocket plane is back in action after a gap of almost two years.\n\nThe Unity vehicle, with two pilots and four passengers aboard, climbed high over the New Mexico desert to the edge of space - before gliding back down.\n\nIt was billed as the plane's final test outing before entering commercial service in June.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThe shooter who killed six people at a school in Nashville, Tennessee, on Monday bought seven guns legally and hid them at home, police say.\n\nInvestigators say the suspect's parents felt the 28-year-old should not own weapons, and did not realise the guns had been concealed in their house.\n\nSix people, including three children age nine, were killed in the attack at the Covenant School.\n\nThe suspect was under \"doctor's care for an emotional disorder\", police say.\n\nThey believe it was the school that was targeted rather than any particular individual but have not indicated any motive.\n\nTennessee has no laws that allow police to seize guns from violent suspects.\n\nDespite the absence of such so-called red-flag laws, police said they would still have sought to have the weapons confiscated if authorities had had any warning that the suspect could have posed a threat.\n\nThe pupils killed in the attack were Evelyn Dieckhaus, Hallie Scruggs and William Kinney.\n\nThree adult employees at the privately run Christian school also died: Cynthia Peak, 61, Katherine Koonce, 60, and Mike Hill, 61.\n\nMs Koonce, the head of the school, and Ms Peak, a substitute teacher, were both close friends with the Tennessee governor's wife.\n\nGovernor Bill Lee said his wife, Maria, had planned to meet Ms Peak the night after she was killed.\n\nPolice have spoken to the parents of the suspect, Audrey Hale, who was killed by police less than 15 minutes after the attack began.\n\nHale, who identified as transgender and was a former student at the school, was armed with three guns, including a semi-automatic rifle.\n\nThe attack took place after the killer conducted surveillance of the premises, drew maps and wrote what police described as a \"manifesto\".\n\nA police spokesman said the attacker did not target any person in particular, but did target \"this school, this church building\".\n\nHale's parents thought the suspect had owned only one gun, but that it had been sold.\n\nThey believed the suspect \"should not own weapons\", and were unaware the suspect \"had been hiding several weapons within the house\", said Nashville Police Chief John Drake on Tuesday.\n\nThe weapons were legally purchased from five shops around the city.\n\nThe killer \"was under care - doctor's care - for an emotional disorder\", Chief Drake said, without providing further details.\n\nIf there had been reports of suicidal or violent tendencies, he added, police would have sought to confiscate the guns.\n\n\"But as it stands, we had absolutely no idea who this person was or if [the suspect] even existed,\" he said.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nPolice received the first call about the incident at 10:13 local time (15:13 GMT) on Monday.\n\nThe suspect drove to the school in a Honda Fit and got into the building by firing through one of the doors, which were all locked.\n\nVideo later released by Nashville police shows the shooter opening fire to shatter glass panes on the front doors, then wandering the school's deserted corridors - at one point walking past a room labelled \"Children's Ministry\".\n\nIn the CCTV footage, the suspect is wearing what appears to be a protective vest and carrying an assault-style rifle in one hand, with a second weapon visible hanging from the left hip.\n\nPolice Chief John Drake said the suspect may have had firearms training\n\nThe suspect fired shots on the ground floor before moving to the building's second floor.\n\nAs police cars arrived, the shooter fired on them from the second floor, striking one vehicle in the windscreen.\n\n\"We believe there has been some training to have been able to shoot from a higher level,\" Chief Drake said.\n\nHe said the suspect had stood away from the glass to avoid being an easy target for police.\n\nOne officer was injured by broken glass.

Ages have been unearthed during excavations for a Northern Ireland firm's new hotel in Dublin.\n\nBurial sites dating back more than 1,000 years were found at Capel Street where an abbey, St Mary's, once stood.\n\nAt least two of the remains are believed to date back to the early 11th Century.\n\nThe excavations have been commissioned by Beannchor, which is building its new Bullitt Dublin hotel on the site.\n\nThe abbey used by the Savigniac and Cistercian orders opened in the 12th Century.\n\nCarbon dating of one of the discovered graves predates that by 100 years, indicating the presence of a Christian settlement on the site prior to St Mary's being built.\n\nThe archaeological investigations at the site, which formerly housed Boland's Bakery, also unearthed the foundations of buildings dating back to the 1600s.\n\nEdmond O'Donovan, director of excavations for Courtney Deery Heritage Consultancy (CDHC), at the Capel Street site\n\nThe finds were discovered close to a former Presbyterian meeting house dating from 1667.\n\nParts of a domestic house known as the 'Dutch Billies' have also been found.\n\nIt was constructed in about 1700 by settlers who came to Dublin after William of Orange ascended to the thrones of England, Scotland and Ireland in 1689.\n\nWhile the skeletal remains will be painstakingly excavated, cleaned and sent for further analysis, before ultimately being given to the National Monuments Services, the other structures found during the examination of the site are set to be incorporated into the design of the new hotel complex.\n\nBeannchor Group, which runs high-profile hotels and bars in Northern Ireland, has undertaken similar restoration of historic buildings in the past, including Belfast's Merchant Hotel, which was a former bank.\n\nIt said the Dublin project is by far its biggest and most complex project to date.\n\nThe 17th Century Presbyterian meeting house will be central to the development of a new bar and restaurant concept.\n\nThe 'Dutch Billies' house will also be preserved while a building with surviving ovens from the Boland's Bakery dating from 1890 will be renovated and repurposed.\n\nEdmond O'Donovan, director of excavations for Courtney Deery Heritage Consultancy (CDHC, said St Mary's Abbey was Ireland's largest and most wealthy medieval abbey in its day.\n\nArchaeologists examine remains at the site of the medieval St Mary's Abbey\n\n\"It was demolished after 1540 when the monastery was disbanded by Henry VIII and was later the site of a 17th Century Presbyterian meeting house.\n\n\"One of the things that was intriguing and exciting about the excavation is that we found an early burial or at least a number of burials that we suspect to be quite early.\n\n\"We have one that's carbon dated to the 11th Century and we have a second burial that was found with a diagnostic stick pin from the 11th Century.\n\n\"And that suggests that there was an earlier Christian and potentially monastic foundation here which predates the Savigniac and Cistercian Abbey.\"\n\nBill Wolsey, managing director of Beannchor, said it was impossible to have foreseen what the project would entail at its outset in 2017.\n\n\"As time went on, we began to understand just how complex this project may be,\" he said.\n\nSkeletal remains unearthed at the site of a new hotel being developed by Belfast-based Beannchor Group in Dublin\n\n\"Great care has been taken to preserve and incorporate elements of these early surviving buildings into the new development, on what we now know is one of the most significant heritage sites in the city.\"\n\nThe new Bullitt Dublin hotel is expected to open in 2025.", "Presidents Xi Jinping and Joe Biden smiled for the cameras at the G20 summit in November\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken's first visit to China comes nearly five months after a major rupture in relations over a Chinese spy balloon.\n\nHis original trip was abruptly cancelled because the balloon, which China says was monitoring weather, drifted across the continental US before being destroyed by American military aircraft.\n\nMr Blinken's visit includes meetings with China's top foreign policy officials but there is no word yet on whether he will also meet Chinese President Xi Jinping, who appeared with Microsoft founder Bill Gates in Beijing on Friday.\n\nThe two global superpowers have a long list of issues that concern them, including high-profile disagreements as well as potential areas of co-operation.\n\nHere are three key areas that could be at the top of the agenda.\n\nFirst and foremost, Mr Blinken's visit is about re-establishing diplomatic interactions of any kind.\n\nLast month there was an initial breaking of the ice when senior US officials met in Vienna, Austria.\n\nBut Mr Blinken is the most senior Biden administration official to travel to China, and it marks the first visit by a US secretary of state to Beijing since October 2018.\n\nNow is a good time to be talking again because that in itself reduces the risk of conflict, said Deputy Assistant to the President and Coordinator for Indo-Pacific Affairs Kurt Campbell, in a pre-trip briefing.\n\n\"We can't let the disagreements that might divide us stand in the way of moving forward on the global priorities that require us all to work together.\"\n\nThe Chinese response to the Blinken visit has been somewhat frosty, however.\n\nIn the official Chinese account of a call with Mr Blinken on Wednesday night, Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang is reported to have told him that \"it is very clear who is to blame\" for the recent deterioration in relations.\n\n\"The United States should respect China's concerns, stop interfering in China's internal affairs, and stop undermining China's sovereignty, security and development interests in the name of competition,\" Mr Qin reportedly said.\n\nThe US has downplayed any significant announcements coming out of this visit. It seems the only \"deliverable\" from the meetings, in diplomatic parlance, will be that the meetings have happened at all.\n\nDon't expect some sort of breakthrough or transformation in the way that the two deal with one another, said Daniel J Kritenbrink, the State Department's senior East Asia diplomat.\n\nIf the meeting leads to further interaction between US and Chinese officials, that would be something both sides could build on.\n\nPresident Biden's relations with China started off on a rocky note, in part because he has been unwilling to cancel trade measures enacted by his predecessor, Donald Trump.\n\nThat includes billions of dollars in import tariffs on Chinese-made products.\n\nIn some areas, Mr Biden has squeezed even harder, with restrictions on US computer-chip exports to China in an effort to maintain US superiority in the most advanced electronics technologies.\n\nChina responded by enacting its own ban on computer memory chips sold by Micron, the largest US manufacturer.\n\nMr Campbell acknowledged China's concerns but said the US would defend and explain what it's done so far and what could lie ahead.\n\nIf computer technology is an area destined for fierce competition between the two superpowers, the illicit drug trade may provide more room for co-operation.\n\nThe US wants to limit the export of Chinese-produced chemical components used to make fentanyl, a synthetic opioid many times more powerful than heroin.\n\nThe rate of US drug overdose deaths involving fentanyl has more than tripled in the last seven years.\n\n\"This is an absolutely critical and urgent issue for the United States,\" said Mr Kritenbrink - but it is one that presents its own challenges.\n\nAfter the balloon incident, there were reports that China was considering sending weapons to Russia, where they would be immediately used in the war against Ukraine.\n\nUS government officials have backed away from those accusations of late, removing what could have been a particularly contentious issue for the two nations that risked turning the Ukraine-Russia conflict into a proxy war between the US and China.\n\nRemote Philippine islands are on the frontlines of US-China tensions\n\nBut expect Mr Blinken to echo warnings given to the Chinese in Vienna that there would be serious consequences if China gives military and financial assistance to Russia.\n\nUS and Chinese warships have been facing off in a high-stakes game of chicken over the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. China claims the area as their own, while the US insists they are international waters.\n\nMr Blinken and his diplomatic team have said that his goal in this trip is to \"de-risk\" the tensions, and renewed communication is the place to start.\n\nAchieving more may be a tall task for now - and more extensive co-operation could become more difficult for Mr Biden as anti-China rhetoric in Washington is sure to heat up when the 2024 presidential elections approach.\n\nA satisfactory outcome from this trip for both sides might be simply the opening of communication channels that prevent an incident leading to military conflict.", "Poppy Devey Waterhouse and Ellie Gould were murdered by their ex-boyfriends\n\nA barrister who led a review into how domestic killers are sentenced said she is \"disappointed\" her report has not been adopted in full.\n\nClare Wade recommended 17 reforms she said were needed to ensure justice for victims of abuse in serious cases.\n\nThe government is proceeding with some of them initially, including longer sentences for killers with a history of coercive control or extreme violence.\n\nJustice Secretary Dominic Raab said other proposals are being considered.\n\nMs Wade's report - published on Friday - recognised that the majority of people killed in domestic cases where there is a background of abuse are women attacked by men.\n\nIt was commissioned following the deaths of Ellie Gould 17, and Poppy Devey Waterhouse, 24, who were both stabbed to death in their homes by male partners.\n\nUnder the government's plans, judges will be required by law to consider a history of coercive or controlling behaviour as an aggravating factor when deciding on a jail term, meaning those offenders will serve longer behind bars.\n\nChanges will also ensure judges hand down longer sentences where \"overkill\" - or excessive violence - has been used.\n\nMr Raab told the BBC he is committed to cracking down on violence against women - but the head of the review warned the proposals \"won't achieve the justice they are intended to achieve if they are all only implemented in part\".\n\nMs Wade was asked by the government in September 2021 to review sentencing guidelines after ministers were warned about \"systemic misogyny within the criminal justice system\" by the victims' commissioner and domestic abuse commissioner.\n\nShe said she was concerned the government is pressing ahead with making a history of controlling or coercive behaviour an aggravating factor - but without enshrining it in law as a mitigating factor for when victims who kill their abusers.\n\nMs Wade, who was the defence barrister for Sally Challen when she became the first woman to have her murder conviction quashed under coercive control laws, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the government's approach \"will make matters much worse for women who kill their abusive partners\".\n\nMr Raab told the BBC he was \"very sympathetic\" to the mitigation argument but insisted he would take time between now and the summer to look at the remaining measures \"carefully and not in a knee-jerk way\".\n\nMs Wade found that under the current rules women who kill a dangerous and abusive partner with a weapon can be jailed for longer than men who use their physical strength to murder.\n\nThat is because of guidelines mandating a higher starting sentence for crimes where a weapon is used - a rule which was introduced to tackle street knife violence - which Ms Wade wants to be discounted in domestic cases.\n\nCampaigners have previously said that the law inadvertently leads to higher sentences for women who use a weapon to defend themselves from a violent partner or ex, but the government has not adopted this recommendation.\n\nThe barrister said \"two or three\" of her recommendations had been adopted - but she had been told by the government that today's announcement is \"interim\".\n\nMr Raab told BBC Breakfast he was \"looking at the wider recommendations\" and had announced measures that can be introduced swiftly.\n\nOther recommendations in the report which have not yet been adopted include:\n\nMr Raab said he wasn't able to provide a timetable for when the changes would be implemented.\n\nThe government is expected to set out a full response to the review in the summer and legislation \"will be introduced as soon as Parliamentary time allows\", a Ministry of Justice spokesperson said.\n\nJustice Secretary Dominic Raab said he was committed to making sentences tougher for domestic killers\n\nAs well as ensuring that judges take coercive control and extreme violence into account, the government will also:\n\nCarole Gould and Julie Devey, whose daughters' murders by ex-partners led to the review, welcomed the changes but told the BBC they would wait to see what weight the aggravating factors were actually given in court.\n\nMs Gould told the BBC she would like to see a 25-year starting point for jail sentences where extreme violence was a factor, which she said would have doubled her daughter's killer's sentence.\n\nEllie Gould, from Wiltshire, was stabbed to death by Thomas Griffiths, then 17, in 2019. He was jailed for 12-and-a-half years, with his age a factor in his sentence.\n\n\"In Ellie's case she was strangled and then she was stabbed 13 times. So these murders are particularly violent and brutal and I think we need to push to make sure that's recognised in the sentencing,\" she said.\n\nMs Devey, whose daughter Poppy Devey Waterhouse was stabbed 49 times in 2018, said the problem would be how much extra time was added on for the new aggravating factors.\n\nMs Wade said she did not advocate introducing a 25-year starting point, adding the \"system is not designed to be applied mechanistically\", and called for emphasis to be put on the history of abuse rather than relying on an automatic sentence requirement.", "Samantha Lee denied breaching Met Police standards in her investigation of Wayne Couzens\n\nA former Met Police officer who carried out a \"lamentably poor\" investigation into Wayne Couzens has been found guilty of gross misconduct.\n\nSamantha Lee failed to make \"the correct investigative inquiries\" into two flashing incidents, a panel heard.\n\nCouzens killed Sarah Everard in south-west London soon after exposing himself to staff at a branch of McDonald's.\n\nDuring the hearing Ms Lee admitted she made some errors in the investigation, but denied gross misconduct.\n\nShe is no longer a police officer having left last year, but was a PC at the time.\n\nWayne Couzens was already serving life for murdering Sarah Everard when he was sentenced for indecent exposure earlier this year\n\nThe police disciplinary panel heard Ms Lee carried out a \"lamentably poor and rushed investigation\" into the two incidents when Couzens exposed himself to female members of staff at the fast food restaurant in Swanley, Kent, on 14 and 27 February 2021.\n\nThe former PC went to the restaurant as part of her investigation on 3 March, just hours before Couzens kidnapped Ms Everard in Clapham.\n\nThe McDonald's manager told the hearing he had shown her CCTV of Couzens where his number plate was clearly visible, and showed her receipts which recorded the last four digits of Couzens' card.\n\nShe said he had told her the footage had already been deleted, a claim the hearing was told was a lie to cover up her failure.\n\nPanel chairman Darren Snow found this dishonesty amounted to gross misconduct, and that had Ms Lee still been a serving officer, she would have been dismissed from the force. He added she will be barred from serving in the police again.\n\nReading the panel's findings, Mr Snow found that Sam Taylor, the McDonald's manager, was a \"credible\" witness and it was \"inconceivable that he would not have shown her the CCTV evidence\".\n\nHe added that the panel believed Ms Lee had been driven to dishonesty by the \"pressure\" of the investigation.\n\nSarah Everard was murdered by Couzens soon after the indecent exposure incidents\n\nIn her evidence, Ms Lee admitted she had made errors, but said nothing she could have done \"would have changed the tragic outcome\" of what happened to Sarah Everard.\n\n\"As much as I have thought it over and over, I don't believe that anything I could have done would have changed the tragic outcome of what happened later that day,\" she said.\n\nSpeaking outside the court, she claimed she has been made a \"scapegoat\" by the Met and said: \"I have never lied\".\n\nIn March this year, Couzens was sentenced to 19 months in prison after admitting three counts of indecent exposure.\n\nHe was already serving life behind bars for the kidnap, rape and murder of Ms Everard.\n\nThe third indecent exposure incident related to when Couzens exposed himself to a female cyclist on a Kent country lane in November 2020.\n\nEvidence heard by the panel has highlighted questions around the wider police response.\n\nThe 999 call, made by the McDonald's manager on 28 February, prompted the operator to run the registration details of the black Seat Exeo through the police national computer which confirmed it was registered to Wayne Couzens and gave his home address, but didn't show he was a serving police officer.\n\nPaul Ozin KC, representing the Met, told the hearing there was \"no standard check that takes place to see whether a suspect in criminal police cases are police officers\".\n\nThis is an issue that's been previously highlighted by the chief constable of British Transport Police, Lucy D'Orsi, who wrote on a policing blog in January it was in her view \"a priority issue for our attention\".\n\nThe case will also raise questions once again over how police respond to indecent exposure offences, which campaigners believe need to be taken far more seriously.\n\nThe panel heard that the 999 call was initially treated as \"comparatively low urgency\".\n\nFormer PC Lee was not assigned to attend the scene until three days later. Just a few hours after she did, Couzens kidnapped Sarah Everard.\n\nDuring the hearing Ms Lee accepted she \"could have done more around CCTV and evidence gathering\", but added she did not \"believe that anything I could have done would have changed the tragic outcome of what happened later that day\".\n\nNow, the police watchdog, the the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is calling for the introduction of a national system to ensure criminal allegations that are made against serving officers notify relevant police forces.\n\nIn a statement, the IOPC added it had already recommended the Met \"consider developing a system automatically flagging when an officer is under criminal investigation\".\n\nThe IOPC's director of operations Amanda Rowe said: \"It may not have prevented Couzens from committing his crimes, but if it is combined with the change in culture that policing recognises is necessary, it could help prevent it from happening again in the future. That's why we'll be exploring this possibility of this with the NPCC later this week.\n\n\"We have also been working closely with the Angiolini Inquiry, sharing evidence to inform its work looking at cultural issues within policing and addressing the broader concerns around women's safety in public highlighted by Sarah Everard's death.\"\n\nThe Met's deputy assistant commissioner Stuart Cundy said: \"As the panel has made clear, honesty and integrity are fundamental to policing and our relationship with the public.\n\n\"The wider circumstances leading to Sarah Everard's terrible murder will be considered by the Angiolini Inquiry and any subsequent inquest, and we are fully assisting them with their vital work.\n\n\"Fundamentally, I am sorry that Couzens was not arrested before he went on to murder Sarah Everard and we continue to think of her loved ones.\"\n\nThe force added it has been \"taking steps to improve\" the way it deals with allegations of indecent exposure - including ensuring investigations are led by specially trained officers, increasing capacity in intelligence teams to identify perpetrators and linked offences, and using a wide range of methods to identify sexual predatory behaviour and deter offenders.\n\nFollow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Like his country, he has become old before he has become rich. Like many rural and migrant workers, he has no choice but to keep working and to keep earning, as he's fallen through a weak social safety net.\n\nA slowing economy, shrinking government benefits and a decades-long one-child policy have created a creeping demographic crisis in in Xi Jinping's China.\n\nThe pension pot is running dry and the country is running out of time to build enough of a fund to care for the growing number of elderly.\n\nOver the next decade, about 300 million people, who are currently aged 50 to 60, are set to leave the Chinese workforce. This is the country's largest age group, nearly equivalent to the size of the US population.\n\nWho will look after them? The answer depends on where you go and who you ask.\n\nMr Cao and his wife live in the north-eastern province of Liaoning, China's former industrial heartland.\n\nVast swathes of farmland and mined hills surround the main city of Shenyang. Plumes of smoke from smelting factories fill the skyline, alongside some of the country's best-preserved world heritage sites from the Qing dynasty.\n\nNearly a quarter of the population here is 65 or older. An increasing number of working-age adults are leaving the heavy industries hub in search of better jobs in bigger cities.\n\nMr Cao's children have moved away too but they are still close enough to visit often.\n\n\"I think I can only keep doing this for another four or five years,\" Mr Cao says, after he and his wife return from collecting wood. Inside their home, flames crackle beneath a heated platform - called a \"kang\" - which is their main source of warmth.\n\nMr Cao lives in what used to be China's industrial heartland\n\nThe couple make around 20,000 yuan (\u00a32,200; $2,700) a year. But the price for the corn they grow is going down and they cannot afford to get sick.\n\n\"In five years, if I'm still physically strong, maybe I can walk by myself. But if I'm feeble and weak, then I might be confined to bed. That's it. Over. I suppose I will become a burden for my children. They will need to look after me.\"\n\nThat is not the future 55-year-old Guohui Tang wants. Her husband had an accident at a construction site and their daughter's university education drained her savings.\n\nSo the former digger operator saw an opportunity in elderly care to fund her own old age. She opened a small care home about an hour from Shenyang.\n\nThe care home Ms Tang runs is her retirement plan\n\nThe pigs and geese both honk a welcome at the back of the single-storey house surrounded by farmland. Ms Tang grows crops to feed her six residents. The animals are not pets - they are also dinner.\n\nMs Tang points to a group of four playing cards as the sun shines through the small conservatory.\n\n\"See that 85-year-old man - he doesn't have a pension, he's relying entirely on his son and daughter. His son pays one month, his daughter pays the next month, but they need to live too.\"\n\nShe is worried that she too will have to depend on her only daughter: \"Now I will pay my pension every month, even if it means I cannot afford to eat or drink.\"\n\nFor generations, China has relied on filial piety to fill the gaps in elderly care. It was a son or daughter's duty to look after ageing parents.\n\nBut there are fewer sons and daughters for ageing parents to rely on - one reason is the \"one-child\" diktat which prevented couples from having two or more children between 1980 to 2015.\n\nWith rapid economic growth, young people have also moved away from their parents, leaving a rising number of seniors to look after themselves or rely on government payments.\n\nBut the pension fund could run out of money by 2035, according to the state-run Chinese Academy of Sciences. That was a 2019 estimate, before the pandemic shutdowns, which hit China's economy hard.\n\nChina may also be forced to raise the age of retirement, which has been on the cards for years. It has one of the lowest retirement ages in the world - 60 for men, 55 for white-collar women and 50 for working-class women.\n\nBut economists say this is just tinkering around the edges if China is to avoid what some fear could become a humanitarian crisis in 25 years.\n\nMeanwhile, more and more elderly have been dipping into their pensions.\n\nThe Fengs in their room at the Sunshine Care Home\n\n\"Welcome to my home,\" beckons 78-year-old Grandma Feng, who only wanted to use her last name.\n\nIt's hard to keep up with her as she races along the corridor to warn her husband that guests are on the way to their room at the Sunshine Care Home. The morning exercise class, where she had been giggling and gossiping at the back with her friends, just ended.\n\nThe home was built to house more than 1,300 residents. Around 20 young people volunteer to live here for free in return for helping to look after some of the elderly. Private companies partly fund the home, taking the pressure off the local government.\n\nThis is an experiment as leaders hunt for solutions for an ageing China. Here in Hangzhou, in southern China, they can afford such experiments.\n\nThis is a different world from Liaoning - the shiny new buildings that are rising up host tech companies such as Alibaba and Ant, a magnet for ambitious, young entrepreneurs.\n\nThe Fengs have been here for eight years. The nursing home seems friendly and there is plenty to do - from gym and table tennis to singing and drama.\n\nThere are plenty of activities to occupy the residents at Sunshine Care Home\n\n\"It is very important to be able to finish the last part of life at a good place,\" Grandma Feng says. She and her husband have been married for more than 50 years. It was love at first sight, they say.\n\nWhen their grandson graduated from junior high school, they decided their task was complete.\n\n\"There are few people of the same age who think like us,\" Grandma Feng says. \"It seems we care more about enjoying life. Those who don't agree think it's unnecessary to pay a lot of money to live here while they have their own house.\"\n\nBut she says she is more \"open-minded\": \"I thought it through. I just gave my house to my son. All we need now is our pension cards.\"\n\nThe couple's room at the care home costs around 2,000 yuan a month. As former employees of state-owned companies, they both have enough of a pension to cover the cost.\n\nTheir pension is far higher than the average in China, around 170 yuan a month in 2020, according to the UN's International Labour Organization.\n\nMs Tang's clients - poor and often pension-less - are a stark contrast to those in the Sunshine Care Home\n\nBut even with clients with decent pensions, the Sunshine Care Home is running at a loss. The director says care homes are costly to start and take time to turn a profit.\n\nBeijing has been pressuring private firms to build daycare centres, wards and other age-care infrastructure to shore up gaps left by indebted local governments.

SAS killings in Afghanistan: The story of one suspicious death\n\nIn 2019, the BBC and the Sunday Times investigated one SAS raid which led to a UK court case and an order to the UK defence minister to disclose documents outlining the government's handling of the case.\n\nFor this latest investigation, the BBC analysed newly obtained operational reports detailing the SAS's accounts of night raids. We found a pattern of strikingly similar reports of Afghan men being shot dead because they pulled AK-47 rifles or hand grenades from behind curtains or other furniture after having been detained.\n\nThe total death toll during the squadron's six-month tour was in the triple figures. No injuries to SAS operatives were reported across all the raids scrutinised by the BBC.\n\nA senior officer who worked at UK Special Forces headquarters told the BBC there was \"real concern\" over the squadron's reports.\n\n\"Too many people were being killed on night raids and the explanations didn't make sense,\" he said. \"Once somebody is detained, they shouldn't end up dead. For it to happen over and over again was causing alarm at HQ. It was clear at the time that something was wrong.\"\n\nInternal emails from the time show that officers reacted with disbelief to the reports, describing them as \"quite incredible\" and referring to the squadron's \"latest massacre\". An operations officer emailed a colleague to say that \"for what must be the 10th time in the last two weeks\" the squadron had sent a detainee back into a building \"and he reappeared with an AK\".\n\n\"Then when they walked back in to a different A [building] with another B [fighting-age male] to open the curtains he grabbed a grenade from behind a curtain and threw it at the c/s [SAS assault team]. Fortunately, it didn't go off\u2026. this is the 8th time this has happened... You couldn't MAKE IT UP!\"\n\nAs the concerns grew, one of the highest-ranking special forces officers in the country warned in a secret memo that there could be a \"deliberate policy\" of unlawful killing in operation. Senior leadership became so concerned that a rare formal review was commissioned of the squadron's tactics. But when a special forces officer was deployed to Afghanistan to interview personnel from the squadron, he appeared to take the SAS version of events at face value.\n\nThe BBC understands that the officer did not visit any of the scenes of the raids or interview any witnesses outside the military. Court documents show that the final report was signed off by the commanding officer of the SAS unit responsible for the suspicious killings.\n\nNone of the evidence was passed on to military police. The BBC discovered that statements containing the concerns were instead put into a restricted-access classified file for \"Anecdotal information about extrajudicial killings\", accessible only to a handful of senior special forces officers.\n\nIn 2012, General Carleton-Smith was appointed head of UK special forces. The BBC understands that he was briefed about the suspicious killings, but he allowed the squadron to return to Afghanistan for another six-month tour.\n\nWhen the Royal Military Police launched a murder investigation in 2013 into one of the raids conducted on that tour, General Carleton-Smith did not disclose to the RMP any of the earlier concerns over unlawful killings, or the existence of the tactical review.\n\nColonel Oliver Lee, who was commander of the Royal Marines in Afghanistan in 2011, told the BBC that the allegations of misconduct raised by our investigation were \"incredibly shocking\" and merited a public inquiry. The apparent failure by special forces leadership to disclose evidence was \"completely unacceptable\", he said.\n\nGeneral Sir Mark Carleton-Smith was head of UK Special Forces when military police investigated the SAS in 2013\n\nThe BBC's investigation focused primarily on one six-month deployment by one SAS squadron that arrived in Afghanistan in November 2010.\n\nThe squadron was operating largely in Helmand province, one of the most dangerous places in Afghanistan, where Taliban ambushes and roadside bombs were common and Army losses were high.\n\nThe squadron's primary role was carrying out deliberate detention operations (DDOs) - also known as \"kill or capture\" raids - designed to detain Taliban commanders and disrupt bomb-making networks.\n\nSeveral sources who were involved in selecting targets for special forces operations told the BBC that there were grave problems with the intelligence behind the selection process, meaning civilians could easily end up on a target list.\n\nAccording to a British representative who was present during target selection in Helmand in 2011, \"Intelligence guys were coming up with lists of people that they figured were Taliban. It would be put through a short process of discussion. That was then passed onto special forces who would be given a kill or capture order.\"\n\nAccording to the source, the targeting was pressured and rushed. \"It didn't necessarily translate into let's kill them all, but certainly there was a pressure to up the game, which basically meant passing out judgements on these people quickly,\" he said.\n\nSources told the BBC that the targeting process for night raids was often rushed and could mislabel innocent civilians\n\nDuring the raids, the SAS squadron used a recognised tactic in which they called everyone from inside a building out, searched and restrained them with cable-tie handcuffs, then took one male back inside to assist special forces operatives with a search.\n\nBut senior officers became concerned by the frequency with which the squadron's own accounts described detainees being taken back inside buildings and then grabbing for hidden weapons - an enemy tactic not reported by other British military forces operating in Afghanistan.\n\nThere were also concerns among officers that on a significant number of raids, there were more people killed than weapons reportedly recovered from the scene - suggesting the SAS was shooting unarmed people - and that SAS operatives might be falsifying evidence by dropping weapons at scenes after killing people.\n\nAfter similar concerns were raised in Australia, a judge-led inquiry was commissioned and found \"credible evidence\" members of Australian Special Forces were responsible for the unlawful killing 39 people, and used 'drop weapons' in an attempt to justify shootings.\n\nBy April 2011, the concerns were so great in the UK that a senior special forces officer wrote to the director of special forces warning that there was evidence of \"deliberate killing of individuals after they have been restrained\" and \"fabrication of evidence to suggest a lawful killing in self-defence\".\n\nTwo days later, the UK Special Forces assistant chief of staff warned the director that the SAS could be operating a policy to \"kill fighting-aged males on target even when they did not pose a threat.\"\n\nIf the suspicions were true, he wrote, the SAS squadron had \"strayed into indefensible ethical and legal behaviour\".\n\nThe SAS squadron operated in some of the most dangerous areas in southern Afghanistan, often raiding residential compounds in villages\n\nThe BBC visited several of the homes raided by the SAS squadron in 2010/11. At one, in a small village in Nad Ali in Helmand, there was a bricked up guesthouse where nine Afghan men including a teenager were killed in the early hours of 7 February 2011.\n\nThe SAS operatives arrived in helicopters under the cover of darkness and approached the house from a nearby field. According to their account, insurgents opened fire at them, prompting them to shoot back and kill everyone in the guesthouse.\n\nOnly three AK-47s were recovered, according to the SAS account - one of at least six raids by the squadron on which the reported number of enemy weapons was fewer than the number of people killed.\n\nInside the guesthouse, what appeared to be bullet holes from the raid were clustered together on the walls low to the ground. The BBC showed photographs from the scene to ballistics experts, who said that the clusters suggested multiple rounds had been fired downward from above, and did not appear indicative of a firefight.\n\nLeigh Neville, an expert on weapons used by UK Special Forces, said the bullet patterns suggested that \"targets were low to the ground, either prone or in a sitting or crouching position close to the wall - an unusual position if they were actively involved in a firefight\".\n\nThe same pattern was visible at two other locations examined by the BBC. Ballistics experts who reviewed images said the bullet holes were suggestive of execution-style killings rather than firefights.\n\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity, an RMP investigator confirmed to the BBC that they had seen photographs from the scenes and that the bullet mark patterns had raised alarm.\n\n\"You can see why we were concerned,\" the investigator said. \"Bullet marks on the walls so low to the ground appeared to undermine the special forces' version of events.\"\n\nIn 2014, the RMP launched Operation Northmoor, a wide-ranging investigation into more than 600 alleged offences by British forces in Afghanistan, including a number of killings by the SAS squadron. But RMP investigators told the BBC that they were obstructed by British military in their efforts to gather evidence.\n\nOperation Northmoor was wound down in 2017 and eventually closed in 2019. The Ministry of Defence has said that no evidence of criminality was found. Members of the investigations team told the BBC they dispute that conclusion.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence said British troops were held to the highest standards. \"No new evidence has been presented, but the Service Police will consider any allegations should new evidence come to light,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nIn a further statement, the MoD said it believed Panorama had jumped to \"unjustified conclusions from allegations that have already been fully investigated\".\n\nIt said: \"We have provided a detailed and comprehensive statement to Panorama, highlighting unequivocally how two Service Police operations carried out extensive and independent investigation into allegations about the conduct of UK forces in Afghanistan.\n\n\"Neither investigation found sufficient evidence to prosecute. Insinuating otherwise is irresponsible, incorrect and puts our brave Armed Forces personnel at risk both in the field and reputationally.\n\n\"The Ministry of Defence of course stands open to considering any new evidence, there would be no obstruction. But in the absence of this, we strongly object to this subjective reporting.\"", "Shareholders in Credit Suisse have told the firm they feel \"failed\" and \"cheated\" after the collapsed bank was rescued by its long-time rival UBS.\n\nOn Tuesday, the 167-year old Swiss bank faced investors for the first time since the deal was struck and for the last time as an independent firm.\n\nCredit Suisse chairman Axel Lehmann said he was \"truly sorry\".\n\nBut one investor told the bank that shareholders had \"everything stolen from them\".\n\nCredit Suisse was rescued by UBS last month in a deal brokered by authorities after turmoil in the US banking sector sent the Swiss lender's shares tumbling.\n\nThe loss-making bank had already been struggling for a number of years after a series of scandals, compliance problems and bad financial bets.\n\nMr Lehmann told investors at the Annual General Meeting that management had a plan to turn things around but had been \"thwarted\" by fears prompted by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in the US.\n\nBut one shareholder suggested the board would have been crucified in medieval times.\n\nAnother held up a sack of empty walnut shells, saying they cost the same as a single Credit Suisse share.\n\nCredit Suisse's chief executive Ulrich Korner said: \"I understand that you feel disappointed, shocked, or angry.\n\n\"I share the disappointment of you, our shareholders, but I also share the disappointment of all of our employees, our clients and, ultimately, the general public.\"\n\nShareholders in both Credit Suisse and UBS - which will hold an investor meeting on Wednesday - have been denied a vote on the takeover because of the emergency measures taken by the Swiss government to rush the deal through.\n\nMr Lehmann said the only other option would have been bankruptcy.\n\n\"This would have led to the worst scenario, namely a total loss for shareholders, unpredictable risks for clients, severe consequences for the economy and the global financial markets,\" he said.\n\n\"It was our duty to protect the interests of our shareholders as best we could to provide security to our clients. We did everything we could within what was possible.\"\n\nCredit Suisse bosses knew they would have to eat humble pie at this meeting, but despite numerous apologies the shareholders remain angry.\n\nIt's common for middle-class Swiss people, especially the elderly, to invest money in a few shares as a back-up to their pensions. What have they traditionally considered safe? Switzerland's two biggest banks. But now Credit Suisse shares are worth less than 10% of what they were two years ago.\n\nOne man representing a group of shareholders accused Credit Suisse management of \"greed and incompetence\", another pointed to his red tie, saying he was wearing it to represent the \"red card\" Credit Suisse deserved.\n\nOthers turned their anger on the Swiss government, which forced through the takeover by UBS over just one weekend while the markets were closed. Some of us, said one shareholder, spend more time choosing our smartphones.\n\nVenting their anger is just about the only action the shareholders can take; the deal with UBS is done. Apologising again, CEO Ulrich Korner said there had been little choice, it was either take the deal with UBS or bankruptcy, which he said would have been catastrophic not just for Switzerland, but for the entire global economy.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Some even had more than cigarettes.\n\nManufacturers have to follow regulations on ingredients, packaging and marketing - and all e-cigarettes and e-liquids must be registered with the Medicine and Health Care Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). But the agency is not required to check the claims made in paperwork and has no power to investigate unregistered products.\n\nMHRA head of e-cigarettes Craig Copland said the results would be reviewed to assess whether the vapes posed a health risk.\n\nBBC News showed the findings to Baxter College pupils Leon and Oscar, whose vapes had been confiscated. They admitted in a previous interview they were hooked on nicotine and struggled to give up vaping.\n\nBaxter College pupils Leon and Oscar learning about their confiscated vapes\n\nThe boys say it is easy to ignore the risks.\n\n\"You won't really care, if you're addicted to it - you'll just forget about it,\" Oscar said.\n\nLeon said regulation and policing should be doing more to tackle the problem.\n\n\"They're not really as bothered as they should be,\" he said.\n\nHead teacher Mat Carpenter was horrified by the findings. He has installed sensors in the school toilets to try to reduce opportunities to vape.\n\n\"It's been part of youth culture for a long time and we are a long way behind the curve in influencing children's behaviour around this, which is why we need such a strong message,\" Mr Carpenter said.\n\n\"As a society we are capable of holding two messages, one that if you smoke already vaping can have a positive effect on your health, but children should not be vaping.\"\n\nUniversity of Nottingham epidemiology professor John Britton, who sits on the Royal College of Physicians Tobacco Group, said inhaling metals could be dangerous.\n\n\"Lead is a neurotoxin and impairs brain development, chrome and nickel are allergens and metal particles in general in the bloodstream can trigger blood clotting and can exacerbate cardiovascular disease,\" he said.\n\n\"The carbonyls are mildly carcinogenic and so with sustained use will increase the risk of cancer - but in legal products, the levels of all of these things is extremely low so the lifetime risk to the individual is extremely small.\"\n\nBut Mr Lawson said there had been a much greater rise in illegal products recently and \"some of these are hard to distinguish between the ones which are potentially legal\".\n\nProf Dame Helen Stokes-Lampard, who is Chair of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, said she was \"genuinely shocked\" by the findings.\n\n\"Unregulated products need to be taken off our streets, out of our shops, and our young people need to be protected.\n\n\"Vaping is something we should be avoiding if we can, albeit better than smoking. If you have any suspicion that your child is using an illicit vape, this is dangerous for their health. Please intervene,\" she advised parents and carers.\n\nThe government has allocated \u00a33m to tackle the sale of illegal vapes in England. It wants to fund more test purchases and have the products removed from shops and is calling for evidence to help cut the number of children accessing vapes.\n\nIt is illegal to sell vapes to under-18s. But a YouGov survey in March and April for Action on Smoking and Health suggests a rise in experimental vaping among 11- to 17-year-olds, from 7.7%, last year, to 11.6%.", "Thieves stole tens of millions of dollars from a Los Angeles cash storage facility on Easter Sunday, with their crime only discovered the next day.\n\nThe theft of at least $30m (\u00a324m) is one of the biggest cash heists in LA history, local media reported.\n\nThere are few clues as to who carried out the crime - which was been described as \"elaborate\" - or exactly how.\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department and FBI are jointly investigating the case.\n\nNo alarms were tripped and no one knew thieves had entered the facility, located in the San Fernando Valley, where cash from local businesses is processed and stored in a vault.\n\nA crew of sophisticated burglars is believed to have come in through the roof, according to local media. Only a small group of people were aware so much cash was held in the building.\n\nIt took until Monday, when facility employees opened the vault, to realise that the massive sum was missing. The safe did not show any outward sign of break-in.\n\nAccording to US media, the theft happened at a GardaWorld facility in the suburban neighbourhood of Sylmar. A news helicopter over the scene captured an apparent hole in the side of the building with debris nearby, however, it is unclear if it is related to the burglary.\n\nThe total surpasses any that has been taken in armoured vehicle robberies in the area, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nThe largest cash heist in LA's history was in September 1997 when $18.9m was stolen from Dunbar Armored Inc, according to the newspaper. Six men, including a former employee, were eventually arrested.\n\nIn 2022, an armoured truck was robbed around 55 miles (90km) north of where Sunday's heist occurred. The thieves grabbed dozens of bags containing vintage jewellery and gems while the guards were distracted.\n\nThe stolen items have been valued at over $100m. No arrests have been made.\n\nLast year, thieves at the Toronto airport stole more than $15m in gold and cash. An aircraft container carrying the goods arrived at the airport and was transported to a cargo holding facility, where police believe the heist took place.\n\nIt is one of the largest heists in Canada's history.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

the system that displays all the latest posts when you use Facebook.\n\nIn a move first reported by news outlet Semafor, Twitter attorney Alex Spiro sent a letter to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday accusing Meta of \"systematic, wilful, and unlawful misappropriation of Twitter's trade secrets and other intellectual property\" to create Threads.\n\nSpecifically, Mr Spiro alleged that Meta had hired dozens of former Twitter employees who \"had and continue to have access to Twitter's trade secrets and other highly confidential information\" that ultimately helped Meta develop what he termed the \"copycat\" Threads app.\n\n\"Twitter intends to strictly enforce its intellectual property rights, and demands that Meta take immediate steps to stop using any Twitter trade secrets or other highly confidential information,\" the letter says.\n\n\"Twitter reserves all rights, including, but not limited to, the right to seek both civil remedies and injunctive relief without further notice.\"\n\nBBC News, which has seen a copy of the letter, has contacted both Meta and Twitter for comment.\n\nMr Musk said that \"competition is fine, cheating is not\" in response to a post on Twitter that referred to the legal letter.\n\nOn Threads, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone posted that \"no one on the Threads engineering team is a former Twitter employee -

it cannot be run at the whim of a single entity, bought or sold.\n\nMeta's plans come at a time when its biggest platform, Facebook, is struggling to attract the attention of a younger audience.\n\nIt has also heavily invested in the metaverse, a virtual world where users interact and work -

The government said its aim was to improve Covid surveillance of travellers arriving at London's main airport from China by helping to detect potential new variants.\n\nThe government said an average of 99 people per flight had been tested, totalling 3,374 passengers.\n\nDuring that period, 14 positive cases were identified, but none was deemed to be a variant of concern.\n\nThe DHSC said from Friday, 17 March \"passengers aged 18 or over travelling from mainland China and arriving at Heathrow Airport will no longer be invited to take a voluntary test on arrival\".\n\n\"The ending of this enhanced surveillance is in line with international partners such as the EU who are reducing border measures to monitor new variants from China\" .\n\nOfficials said the government would maintain a range of contingency measures to \"enable detection, and swift and proportionate action, for potential new harmful variants\" should the need arise.\n\nLast December, ministers confirmed that passengers arriving to England from China would have to provide a negative Covid test before they boarded their flights.\n\nThe Chinese government was reporting about 5,000 cases a day at the time, but analysts said the numbers were vastly undercounted - and that the daily caseload could have been closer to one million.\n\nOther countries around the world such as the US, France India also implemented testing.\n\nWhile the decision only affected English airports, the government said that despite their being no direct flights from China to Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, that it was working with the devolved administrations to ensure the policy was applied UK-wide.\n\nIn January, China reopened its borders to international visitors for the first time since it imposed travel restrictions in March 2020 while officials declared later that month that the country's current wave of Covid-19 infections was \"coming to an end\".\n\nChina's National Health Commission stopped publishing data on Covid cases and deaths on 25 December after the relaxation of its zero-Covid policy and in February declared a \"decisive victory\" over the pandemic.", "When this cow ran onto an interstate, police in Michigan relied on a cowboy to lasso the suspect bovine.

BBC Wales environment correspondent Steffan Messenger explains why Ffos-y-Fran is closing and what happens next\n\nThe UK's last opencast coalmine has closed as fears mount over whether the massive site will be restored.\n\nDocuments seen by BBC News show concerns at the Welsh government and UK Coal Authority that Merthyr Tydfil's Ffos-y-Fran mine may be abandoned.\n\nEstimated clean-up costs for the site - the size of 400 football pitches - have grown to between \u00a3120m and \u00a3175m.\n\nSite operator Merthyr (South Wales) Ltd said it was in \"constructive dialogue\" with Merthyr Tydfil council.\n\nUnion Unite, which represents 115 workers being made redundant as coal mining stops, said it understood the company was \"committed\" to restoring the site in future and would not walk away.\n\nWelsh mountain pony breeder Roy Thomas, 80, who lives metres from the mine's boundary, called it \"a total blight\" on his life for the past 16 years and described the mine as a \"neighbour from hell\".\n\nThe Welsh government allowed the controversial project to happen close to homes and businesses because it is a \"land reclamation scheme\" that requires the operator to return it to green hillside, with most of that work due to happen after mining had stopped.\n\nToday a giant pit - which is about 656ft (200m) deep - remains.\n\nA large black hole remains at Ffos-y-Fran, visible from parts of Merthyr Tydfil and the A465 Heads of the Valley road\n\nMr Thomas described the scene as \"absolutely disgusting\", adding that the mounds of spoil material should go back in the hole as there is \"millions of tonnes of material in there\".\n\nFfos-y-Fran has produced nearly 11.25m tonnes of coal since opening in 2008, and is responsible for 86% of the UK's total coal output.\n\nSince September 2022, its owners have been digging without planning permission - an application for more time was refused and the firm appealed an enforcement notice before announcing a closure date of 30 November.\n\nNegotiations between the firm and the council continue over what happens next.\n\nThe company has admitted \"insufficient funds\" had been set aside to carry out the agreed restoration work.\n\nIn a letter released under the Freedom of Information Act to campaign group Coal Action Network and shared with BBC News, the UK Coal Authority's chief executive criticised the council's approach.\n\nWriting to the Welsh government on 20 October, Lisa Pinney said there had been \"very little visible progress\" in preparing for the mine's closure and \"no agreed revised restoration plan or emergency response plan in place if the site should be abandoned\".\n\nHow to manage rising water levels is one issue yet to be resolved, with Ms Pinney writing that, without a clear plan, \"there is a clear risk to public safety and to the environment\".\n\nAnother document released to the campaigners reveals advice for climate change minister Julie James.\n\nThe heavily redacted document, also sent to First Minister Mark Drakeford, said \"officials consider the company is likely to seek administration\" after coal mining stops.\n\nAlternatively \"they may seek to continue to restore the site\", as long as they can draw down money from a \u00a315m bank account held by the council, the document adds.\n\nThis escrow account was set up as a fall-back fund should the company go bust - the restoration itself is meant to be paid for out of the company's own finances.\n\nLatest publicly available accounts for the firm's parent company suggest \u00a371.4m was budgeted for in December 2021 as restoration provision.\n\nFfos-y-Fran as it looked at the start of mining in 2008\n\nDaniel Therkelsen of Coal Action Network said settling for a far cheaper restoration would be a \"betrayal to the 140,000 people in Merthyr Tydfil\".\n\nHe said they had already \"paid the price for the restoration promised to them with over 16 years of coal dust and noise pollution,\" and called for a public inquiry into the authorities' handling of the site.\n\nSince it started, the scheme has paid \u00a31 for every tonne of coal produced into a community fund, managed by the council, which offers grants to projects in the area.\n\nMerthyr (South Wales) Ltd said it continued to hold \"constructive dialogue with [Merthyr Tydfil council] and other relevant stakeholders on the revised restoration plan\".\n\n\"There will be no further comment until the plan is finalised and approved by the relevant parties,\" it added.\n\nIt is understood a small team of staff is to be retained on site for \"care and maintenance\" but Unite's Jason Bartlett said the closure was \"heart-breaking\" for the workers involved.\n\nA number of jobs could come back once the restoration plan had been negotiated, he said - but how many would \"depend on what the plan looks like\".\n\nThe Coal Authority said managing the mine's restoration and associated public safety was a matter for the landowner and local authority but it would provide advice as needed.\n\nThe council disputed criticism from the Coal Authority, saying negotiations to reach a \"revised restoration plan\" had been ongoing for more than year.\n\nThe Welsh government said: \"Welsh Ministers cannot comment on individual cases as the Welsh government has a formal role in determining planning enforcement appeals.\"", "Come on Barbie, let's get charty: Even Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling can't resist a sing-along to the soundtrack\n\nBarbie's already taken over the box office and now the film's soundtrack has conquered the UK music charts too.\n\nTracks by Billie Eilish, Dua Lipa and Nicki Minaj have stormed straight into the top five since the pink-tinged blockbuster's release one week ago.\n\nAnd they weren't the only songs from the star-studded album to hit the chart.\n\nAnywhere else he'd be a top 10, but Ryan Gosling brought some Kenergy at number 25 with his ballad I'm Just Ken.\n\nBosses of the Official Singles Chart say it's the first time three tracks from a soundtrack have reached the top five at the same time.\n\nAnd they say it made history with a total of six tracks in the top 40:\n\nSome of pop's biggest names were behind the soundtrack's pink, sparkly hits, and you might think that recruiting such a glitzy line-up would be hard work.\n\nBut the film's music supervisor George Drakoulias tells BBC Newsbeat you'd be wrong.\n\n\"Nobody said no,\" he says. \"Everybody was really excited.\"\n\nThat included two stars at the top of George's wish list, Nicki Minaj and Lizzo, along with superstar writer and producer Mark Ronson.\n\nGeorge says he enticed Mark on to the project with a simple text message: \"Hey Barbie?\"\n\n\"He called me right back and we sent him a script,\" says George. \"That started the ball rolling.\"\n\nMark ended up curating the soundtrack, writing the score and penning the film's closing song, Dance the Night Away, with Dua Lipa.\n\nDolly Chartin': Dua Lipa's song Dance the Night Away was the first song from the soundtrack to be released\n\nThe soundtrack's also played a big part in Barbie's massive marketing campaign.\n\nSongs from the 17-track album have been steadily released in the run-up to the film's release, which George says has \"helped fuel excitement for the movie\".\n\n\"It was a perfect symbiotic relationship of the music driving the movie and the movie driving the music,\" he says.\n\n\"Once you saw the movie and how well the music works, as soon as they left the theatre people went out and got the album.\"\n\nAnd, this being Barbie, physical copies of the soundtrack are available in \"cotton candy\" vinyl and on transparent pink cassette tapes.\n\nNicki Minaj collaborated with Ice Spice to release Barbie World, which has been streamed more than 42m times on YouTube\n\nGeorge refuses to reveal his favourite track but says he was \"blown away\" by Billie Eilish's What Was I Made For.\n\nHe says the singer was shown just 25 minutes of the film and managed to \"take what she'd seen and encapsulate it into this heartbreaking song of being a woman\".\n\nGeorge says he's very proud of the album and its success in the charts is \"the icing on the cake\".\n\n\"It's Barbie's world, we just live in it,\" he says.\n\nAqua's Barbie Girl, sampled in Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice's movie song, also returned to the chart for the first time since its original release in 1997.\n\nAnd while plastic sure is fantastic, Dave and Central Cee kept the top spot, with Sprinter entering its eighth week at number one.\n\nOlivia Rodrigo also sunk her teeth deeper into the number two slot, holding firm with Vampire.\n\nAs recently as 2018, The Greatest Showman soundtrack sold 2.1m copies in the UK, outpacing new releases by Drake and Ariana Grande.\n\nBut the idea of chart-topping artists working together on a blockbuster movie had largely fallen out of favour in the era of superhero franchises and cinematic universes.\n\nEven before that, young adult movies like Twilight and Hunger Games were aligning themselves with credible alternative artists like Paramore, Iron & Wine and The National. Lorde even curated the (superb) music for Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Pt 1.\n\nOver the last few years, there have been flickers of the traditional soundtrack album returning. OneRepublic's I Ain't Worried was a breakout hit from last year's Top Gun Maverick; and Post Malone & Swae Lee's Sunflower (from Spider-Man: Into The Spiderverse) was a top three single in 2018.\n\nBut, just like the movie, the Barbie soundtrack is confounding expectations. The tracklist is like a who's who of modern pop - Lizzo, Ice Spice, PinkPantheress, Dua Lipa.

a stark contrast to the chants lead by organisers before that silence.\n\nOn Monday, police investigating the murder appealed for people to stop sharing and commenting on graphic videos and texts circulating on social media platforms.\n\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said the material contained inaccuracies and was \"also causing significant distress to Chloe's family and friends\".\n\nFlowers have been spread across King George's Park, Harryville, Ballymena\n\nDet Ch Insp Millar added: \"I am also aware of commentary in the media speculating about the recovery of human remains at specific locations.\n\n\"We would ask people not to comment and share such matters as they are likely to be incorrect, inaccurate and very hurtful to Chloe's family.\"", "Mr Feij\u00f3o said it was his duty to try to form a government, but his chances look very slim\n\nSpain has entered a phase of political uncertainty that could see the country return to the polls in just a few months.\n\nThe conservative People's Party (PP) won the most seats but fell short of a parliamentary majority, even with the support of the far-right Vox party.\n\nNow, the conservatives and the incumbent Socialists will both separately try to form coalitions.\n\nPP leader Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o and his rival, Socialist Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, will each begin negotiations on Monday to try to head off a fresh vote, which might take place by the end of 2023.\n\nAs the leader of the party that won the most votes, Mr Feij\u00f3o will be invited by King Felipe VI to try to form a government. If Mr Feij\u00f3o declines on the grounds that he cannot muster enough support - as former PP leader Mariano Rajoy did in a similar situation in 2015 - the king may turn to Mr S\u00e1nchez.\n\nIf the candidate accepts the king's invitation, he then has two months to secure a majority.\n\nFailing that, new elections must be held.\n\nPP official Borja S\u00e9mper said Mr S\u00e1nchez is the first person Mr Feij\u00f3o will call to ask him to agree to support the PP in forming a \"solo government with specific agreements\" - a request the Socialist prime minister is unlikely to agree to.\n\nDespite the inconclusive results, Mr Feij\u00f3o told cheering conservative supporters that it was now his duty to try to form a government.\n\n\"Spaniards know we have gone from being the second force to the party with the most votes,\" he said, adding: \"I hope this doesn't start a period of uncertainty in Spain.\"\n\nBut that is what Spain is facing. Because with far-right party Vox on 33 seats and Mr Feij\u00f3o's PP on 136, they would be seven seats short of an absolute majority of 176 in parliament.\n\nThat is why Mr S\u00e1nchez's Socialists and his far-left allies Sumar appeared happiest in the wake of the results.\n\n\"The reactionary bloc of regression, which set out a complete reversal of all the advances that we've achieved over the past four years, has failed,\" he told supporters.\n\nSocialist supporters in Madrid were delighted with leader Pedro S\u00e1nchez's performance\n\nOne Spanish website, El Espa\u00f1ol, said that despite the PP's victory, Mr S\u00e1nchez still had a chance of forming a government.\n\nBut those very slim chances would require going even further than before in securing separatist support.\n\nMr Sanchez would need the support of hardline, pro-independence party Together for Catalonia (Junts). But its leader, Carles Puigdemont, who has been living in self-imposed exile in Belgium since Catalonia's failed independence bid in 2017, said earlier this month that Junts would not support either the Socialists or the PP.\n\nOn Monday, the party's general secretary Jordi Turull seemed to indicate the party could use its new kingmaker status as a bargaining chip to advance the cause of Catalan independence.\n\nBut although Mr S\u00e1nchez has taken steps to normalise relations with the separatists by pardoning jailed pro-independence leaders and downgrading the crime of secession, he has repeatedly and firmly said that he would not allow Catalonia to hold a referendum on self-determination.\n\nWhile PP leader Mr Feij\u00f3o declared victory after the results were announced, one of the few leaders who showed no sign of celebrating was far-right Vox leader Santiago Abascal. \"It's a day of concern,\" he said on Sunday night.\n\nPolitical analyst Iago Moreno said the far right blamed the conservative PP for \"complicity in the demonisation of Vox\", seeing Sunday's result as the beginning of a journey to a \"second round\" which could come by Christmas.\n\n\"We have not achieved our objectives to kick Pedro Sanchez out... There will probably be another election where we can make this happen,\" Mr Abascal said.\n\nWhile the Socialist leader and Sumar put on a show of unity in a TV debate last week, conservative leader Mr Feij\u00f3o was conspicuously absent, giving the impression that Vox was on its own.\n\nBut Vox voters did come out in force, backing Mr Abascal's platform of anti-immigration and anti-feminism. Many saw him as their best hope of defending Spain's traditional values.\n\nTurnout topped 70% on Sunday, as voters sensed the importance of this rare mid-summer election. That was partly due to almost 2.5 million postal votes being cast, but polling stations were busiest in the morning before the heat took hold.\n\nVox remains the third biggest party, with the support of three million of Spain's 37 million voters, but not significantly ahead of Sumar and with a big drop in seat numbers.\n\nVoting numbers were buoyed on Sunday by 1.6 million young voters having the right to take part in the election for the first time.\n\nAn estimated 10 million Spaniards are already on holiday and one man at a coastal polling station made a point of wearing a snorkel and flippers.\n\nMany voters said they felt there was too much at stake in this election, even if it was being held in mid-summer. One father of three, called Sergio, told the BBC that many people he knew were anxious and angry that an extreme-right party might end up in government.\n\nI support Vox because I see it as the only party that can radically change all the left-wing policies that have been approved little by little", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Feel free to use my voice without penalty,\" she tweeted.\n\nHer declaration comes as the music industry scrambles to react to a spate of AI songs trained on artist's voices\n\nLast week, Universal Music successfully petitioned streaming services to remove a song called Heart On My Sleeve, which used deep-faked vocals from their artists Drake and The Weeknd.\n\nIn a statement, the label said \"the training of generative AI using our artists' music\" was \"a violation of copyright law\". However, that position has not been tested in court, and remains a legal grey area.\n\nA report by The Verge discovered that Universal managed to get the track pulled from YouTube because it contained an unlicensed sample of the producer Metro Boomin' saying his name, which was protected by copyright, rather than any claims over the song itself, which appears to be an original composition.\n\nFor context: Copyright law is very much based on the idea of making a copy - whether it's of a melody or a lyric, by the use of a sample, or making a derivative work like a remix. Heart On My Sleeve did not, it seems, directly lift elements from Drake's previous songs.\n\nDrake and The Weeknd are not thought to have been involved in the creation of Heart On My Sleeve - although some critics have suggested the song was released by Drake as a stunt\n\nFurther to this, the US Copyright Office recently ruled that AI art, including music, can't be copyrighted as it is \"not the product of human authorship\".\n\nIt is still unclear whether art that is created by a human, but which contains AI elements, can be copyrighted.\n\nOn Twitter, Grimes said she was energised by the \"idea of open sourcing all art and killing copyright\".\n\nThe musician said she was already working on a programme \"that should simulate my voice well\", but would also consider releasing a capella tracks for people to train their own software on..\n\nAfter her announcement, fans immediately posted links to songs they had created featuring her vocals.\n\nThe Canadian artist said she was looking forward to being a \"guinea pig\" for the technology, adding: \"I think it's cool to be fused w[ith] a machine\".\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

[I] don't wanna be responsible for a Nazi anthem unless it's somehow in jest, a la Producers I guess,\" she said, referring to Mel Brooks' infamous satire.\n\nShe suggested she would also remove songs that were \"anti-abortion or [something] like that\".\n\nBut in a later tweet, Grimes said she wasn't sure she had the legal right to ask for songs using her voice to be taken down.\n\n\"Curious what the actual legality is,\" she wrote. \"I think I chose not to copyright my name and likeness back when that was a convo.\"\n\nGrimes has two children with Elon Musk, but the couple split last year\n\nAs an artist, Grimes has long explored the relationship between humans and machines, with songs like We Appreciate Power and Flesh Without Blood exploring the ethical quandaries surrounding Artificial Intelligence.\n\nIn 2020, she also teamed up with the mood music company Endel to create an AI-generated lullaby for her first child, named X \u00c6 A-12, with SpaceX founder and Twitter CEO Elon Musk.

To ensure the highest possible turnout when people are being offered no real choice, the government has criminalised any attempt to boycott the election or spoil the ballot papers.\n\nOpposition lawmakers this year have reported violent attacks, with Human Rights Watch reporting the government stepped up intimidation and arbitrary arrests of political opposition in the run-up to the poll.\n\nIn May, the government barred the country's main opposition party, the Candlelight Party, on a technicality. The National Election Commission said the party was missing paperwork, which it had not needed for the local elections last year.\n\nCandlelight had won 22% of the vote in local elections last year - and analysts say Hun Sen saw them as a potential threat to his rule.\n\nBut the poll comes as Hun Sen, who cast his vote in the capital early on Sunday morning, shows the clearest signals yet that he's planning to hand power to his eldest son, Hun Manet - possibly within weeks. The military chief has led the CPP's campaign alongside his father.\n\nHun Sen has become increasingly authoritarian in his rule, political analysts say.\n\nIt is the second election in a row where Hun Sen has targeted democratic institutions and crippled the opposition before voting day, analysts say.\n\nIn 2018, his Cambodian People's Party won every single seat in the 125-seat National Assembly after the main opposition alliance was dissolved by the politically controlled courts.\n\nSeventeen other parties are participating in this year's election, but almost all are too small, new or are aligned with the ruling party to be considered credible challengers.\n\nThe vote comes at an uncertain time for Cambodia's economy - with locals reporting struggles with rising fuel prices, stagnant wages and growing debts.\n\nHun Manet is expected to take over from his father\n\nWhile Hun Sen is campaigning for re-election, he has flagged that this may be his last term. In 2021, he said would hand over control to his eldest son who currently commands the Royal Cambodian Army.\n\nHan Manet is a first-time candidate for a parliament seat this election and led the final day of party rallies in Phnom Penh on Friday.\n\nNo timeframe had been given for the transition of power until Thursday, when Hun Sen signalled his son \"could be\" prime minister in three or four weeks.\n\nHun Sen's party has won all six of the national elections held every five years since the 1990s, when the UN helped the Southeast Asian nation of 16 million people become a functioning democracy post decades of civil war and the murderous Khmer Rouge regime.\n\nOver four decades, he has consolidated power through control of the military, police and moneyed interests.

In 2022, there were 13 cases recorded by police, including seven at polling stations, none of which led to prosecutions.\n\nResearch published by the commission on Friday found 0.7% of voters were initially turned away from polling stations in May. Around two-thirds of these returned later in the day and were able to vote.\n\nLabour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said the rules were having a \"chilling effect on democracy\".\n\nBut Labour have stopped short of saying they would scrap the policy, with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer calling for a \"wide review\" into the impact of Voter ID.\n\n\"This is the first piece of evidence coming through, so we need to look at everything in the round,\" he said.\n\nLib Dem spokesperson Helen Morgan said the policy \"looks like a transparent attempt at voter suppression by Conservative ministers who are desperate to stop people from holding them to account\".\n\n\"It is an outrage that thousands of people were denied a voice at the local elections because of the Conservative Party's Voter ID rules,\" she added.\n\nThe government announced the voter ID move in 2021, arguing it would tackle voter fraud and boost public confidence in elections.\n\nPassports, driving licences and blue badges are among the IDs permitted. Only 25,000 of the 90,000 free Voter Authority Certificates applied for before May's election were used as a form of ID.\n\nThere have been only a handful of convictions for electoral fraud in recent years - but ministers argue a lack of evidence could be masking the true level.\n\nThey also point out that voter ID has been a requirement in Northern Ireland since 2003, as well as in many other European countries.\n\nOpposition parties voted against it, arguing it was unnecessary and would hit turnout among marginalised groups.\n\nConservative MP Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, who was in the Cabinet when the measure was introduced, recently said the voter ID policy had been an attempt at gerrymandering - fixing rules to gain electoral advantage.\n\nHe said the measure had come \"back to bite them,\" claiming his party's vote had been hit because older people, who were more likely to vote Tory, were also more likely to lack an accepted form of identity.\n\nBefore the election, 87% of people in England were aware that they needed to show photo ID to vote at a polling station, according to a survey carried on behalf of the commission. The polling excluded London, which did not hold local elections in May.\n\nMr Westwood said: \"The evidence suggests that the vast majority of voters were able to present an accepted form of ID at the May elections.\n\n\"But it also shows that some people were prevented from voting in polling stations due to the requirement, and significantly more did not attempt to because they lacked the required ID.\n\n\"Overall awareness was high and achieved in a matter of months, but we can see that people who lacked ID were less likely to know they needed to show it.\n\nThe commission plans to publish its full election report in September.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

After that I moved to London to work on the Mr Bean cartoon. That was my first animation job.\"\n\nGone are the days of using paper and pencil to draw; now Owain creates using a computer\n\nEven though he was happy in London and had no plans to move, in 2016 two huge moments changed Owain's life.\n\nJoe Brumm, an animator in Australia, emailed Owain asking if he would like to go over there to work on his idea for a cartoon.\n\nThen Owain met his partner, Kristen, an Australian.\n\nJoe's idea, about a cartoon family of dogs, was given the green light and a year later Owain found himself working on Bluey as the series' chief designer in Brisbane.\n\nOwain and Kristen now have a daughter called Nia\n\nBluey has since become a phenomenon. It has won awards galore in Australia and has become a firm favourite with children in countries including the UK.\n\nBut even Owain admits \"nobody knew how big the show was going to become\".\n\nHow does his work as designer and rigger fit in with the whole process of bringing the cartoon to life on-screen?\n\nBluey has become a sensation across the world\n\n\"My role is to take the props and the characters the art director designs and construct them using special software, ready for the animators,\" Owain explained.\n\n\"If the character needs to talk, walk, hold props, turn 360 degrees\u2026 we need to design everything, from the shape of the mouth to the shape of the hand, until you've created everything the character needs to do.\n\n\"You're like a mechanic building the inside. The lower part of the body needs to move the top of the head, and the top of the arm needs to be able to move the lower part, which then moves the hand. Then, the animators work to bring the characters to life.\n\n\"It's a big job because every character on Bluey has over 150 mouth shapes, over 200 hands, and 40 feet.\"\n\nEach episode lasts seven minutes, but every finished programme requires four months of work from start to finish.\n\nAs well as working on Bluey, Owain has also worked on other children's cartoons in Australia. But, he says it can be quite hard to get a job as a designer in the world of animation.\n\nOf course even though you need talent there is an element of luck and who you know.\n\n\"I was lucky, I did well in university, so they sent me to London for an industry night, and I met with a person who was working on the Mr Bean cartoon. And with luck, my final project looked like the style of Mr Bean, so I was asked to work on the series.\n\n\"Every job I've worked on since has been through people I know.\"\n\nOwain and the rest of the crew that work on the third series of Bluey\n\nOwain has now been in Australia for six years and has a young daughter Nia with Kristen.\n\nThe Bluey production team is waiting to see if there will be a fourth series of the cartoon.\n\nIn the meantime, Owain has set up an animation company with a co-worker and they are looking for new projects.\n\nBut he said he also wanted to work on something that reminds him of Wales.\n\n\"I've never done anything in the Welsh language,\" he said. \"I'm so far from home - my family are all back in Wales and I miss Wales so much.\n\n\"I try and read to Nia in Welsh so I want to draw Welsh-language books. I don't have to come up with the idea, I just want, 'designed by Owain Emanuel' on it.\n\n\"And a Welsh-language cartoon would be great. But one step at a time\u2026\"\n\nYou can watch Bluey on BBC iPlayer or the BBC CBeebies TV channel.", "Ukraine and Russia have reported inflicting heavy losses as the battle for Bakhmut rages on.\n\nMoscow has been trying to take the eastern Ukrainian city for months in a grinding war of attrition.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russian forces had suffered more than 1,100 deaths in the past few days, with many more seriously injured.\n\nRussia said it had killed more than 220 Ukrainian service members over the past 24 hours.\n\nThe BBC is unable to verify the numbers given by either side.\n\nAnalysts say Bakhmut has little strategic value, but has become a focal point for Russian commanders who have struggled to deliver any positive news to the Kremlin.\n\nCapture of the city would bring Russia slightly closer to its goal of controlling the whole of Donetsk region, one of four regions in eastern and southern Ukraine annexed by Russia last September following referendums widely condemned outside Russia as a sham.\n\nUkrainian commanders, who have committed significant resources to defending the city, say their strategy aims to tie Russia's forces down and prevent Moscow from launching any further offensives in the coming months.\n\n\"In less than a week, starting from 6 March, we managed to kill more than 1,100 enemy soldiers in the Bakhmut sector alone, Russia's irreversible loss, right there, near Bakhmut,\" Mr Zelensky said in his nightly video address.\n\nHe added that 1,500 Russian soldiers were wounded badly enough to keep them out of further action.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said Russian forces had killed \"more than 220 Ukrainian servicemen\".\n\nThe commander of Ukraine's ground forces, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, said the Russian mercenary Wagner Group was attacking his troops from several directions in a bid to break through defences and advance to the central districts of the town.\n\nThe paramilitary organisation is at the heart of the Russian assault on Bakhmut. Its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has staked his reputation, and that of his private army, on seizing Bakhmut.\n\nHe said on Sunday that the situation in the city was \"difficult, very difficult, the enemy is fighting for every metre\".\n\n\"And the closer to the city centre, the fiercer the fighting,\" he said in a voice recording published on Telegram.\n\nAfter his envisioned capture of Bakhmut, \"we will begin to reboot\" and \"will start recruiting new people from the regions\", he said.\n\nAnd on Saturday, the Institute for the Study of War - a US think tank - reported that Moscow's offence was stalling.\n\n\"Wagner Group fighters are likely becoming increasingly pinned in urban areas... and are therefore finding it difficult to make significant advances,\" it said.\n\nThere were about 70,000 people living in Bakhmut before the invasion, but only a few thousand remain. The city was once best known for its salt and gypsum mines and huge winery.\n\nThose who remain in the city risk a hazardous existence, with four people injured in Bakhmut on Monday, Donetsk regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said.\n\nLike Russia, Ukraine has also given Bakhmut political significance, with President Zelensky making the city an emblem of resistance.\n\nWhen he visited Washington in December, he called it \"the fortress of our morale\" and gave a Bakhmut flag to the US Congress.\n\nWestern officials estimate between 20,000 and 30,000 Russian troops have been killed or injured so far in and around Bakhmut.\n\nA draft law introduced in the Russian parliament on Monday aims to push back the age bracket for compulsory military service, from the current 18-27 years to 21-30.\n\nReuters reported that, due to the transition period between the old legislation and the new, 2024 and 2025 would see the conscription age span 10 or 11 years rather than the usual nine - meaning more men would be eligible to fight.\n\nRussia's previous attempt to draft thousands of new recruits into the Ukraine war met with some resistance. In September the announcement of a partial military mobilisation saw long queues form at border crossings as men of draft age sought to flee the call-up.\n\nThe Kremlin said reports of fighting-age men fleeing had been exaggerated.\n\nBesides the Bakhmut fighting, seven residents were injured elsewhere in Donetsk region on Monday, governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said.\n\nFurther east in Luhansk, regional governor Serhiy Haidai said the Russians had \"significantly intensified shelling\" on the front line. He added that Russia was bringing more and more equipment and troops to the area.\n\nElsewhere in eastern Ukraine, there were 47 attacks on Ukrainian troops in Zaporizhzhia, according to the regional administration.", "Amy Jones hit a superb unbeaten 92 to lead England to a four-wicket win over New Zealand in the first one-day international.\n\nNeeding 208 to win, the tourists slumped to 79-6 in Wellington before being rescued by a record unbroken seventh-wicket stand of 130 between Jones and Charlie Dean.\n\nJones took the lead, playing a perfectly paced counter-attacking innings, with Dean keeping her cool in a valuable supporting knock of 42 as England got over the line with 8.4 overs to spare.\n\nDean had earlier taken three wickets to become the fastest woman to 50 ODI scalps in only her 26th game.\n\nThe off-spinner made the initial breakthrough after an opening partnership of 90 between Suzie Bates and Bernadine Bezuidenhout.\n\nBates was dropped twice in the first seven balls of the match and was also fortunate to escape lbw and stumping shouts which would have been overturned had they been reviewed.\n\nShe made the most of that good fortune to hit her 34th ODI fifty, but was stumped next ball as the White Ferns subsided to 207 all out.\n\nThat looked eminently chaseable at the halfway point but England quickly found themselves in trouble and, when Danni Wyatt was bowled by Amelia Kerr in the 17th over, the visitors were six down and facing defeat.\n\nBut Jones and Dean went about rectifying the situation to give Heather Knight's side a 1-0 series lead as the teams head to Hamilton for the second ODI, beginning at 23:00 BST on Wednesday.\n\nHaving failed to reach double figures in four innings during the T20 series, this was an impressive return to form for Jones after England found themselves in a sizeable hole.\n\nThe visitors would have been confident starting the chase but lost Tammy Beaumont - bowled by a Jess Kerr full toss just below waist height - without a run on the board.\n\nWhile they recovered from that early blow, the loss of five wickets in eight overs - including three for only four runs - left England on the brink.\n\nMaia Bouchier was bounced out by the fiery Lea Tahuhu, Alice Capsey was plumb lbw after missing a reverse sweep and Nat Sciver-Brunt was run out trying to sneak a second run on a misfield.\n\nAll the hallmarks of an England collapse were there and New Zealand sensed that one more wicket would bring the match to a swift conclusion.\n\nBut the wicket never arrived as Jones went to work. While she and Dean were happy to tick over with ones and twos, Jones was also able to put the pressure back on the Kiwi bowlers with a number of bold shots over the top.\n\nNew Zealand continued to push for a breakthrough until the last, but the England pair were increasingly comfortable and offered little in the way of encouragement.\n\nAs the required runs ticked down, Jones kicked for home with a flurry of eye-catching boundaries before it was left to Dean to seal the win with one of her own.\n\nIn her first international white-ball game since September, Kate Cross was England's standout bowler at the Basin Reserve.\n\nThe seamer should have had a wicket with her second ball when Bates chipped to mid-on, only for Sophie Ecclestone to dive over the ball.\n\nWhen Bates was dropped again off Lauren Bell to start the next over and survived after England opted not to take an lbw review soon after, frustration could have begun to creep in for the visitors.\n\nBut Cross continued to calmly probe away, getting the ball to shape away nicely while also making the most of a green-tinged surface to nibble the ball around off the seam.\n\nDespite beating the bat countless times, she had to wait until her second spell for her reward as New Zealand's openers battled through against the new ball.\n\nBates and Bezuidenhout had been tied down by the England quicks and, although the runs came easier with the introduction of spin, it also proved their downfall as Dean made the breakthrough and Ecclestone quickly took the second New Zealand wicket.\n\nNew Zealand regrouped through Amelia Kerr, captaining the side for the first time in ODIs, and Georgia Plimmer.\n\nHowever, Cross returned to remove them both lbw in an exceptional spell that sparked a New Zealand collapse of eight wickets for 68 runs.\n\nEven after a collapse of their own, the efforts of Jones and Dean ensured the work of England's bowlers did not go to waste.\n\n'Jones and Dean give lesson for us all' - reaction\n\nPlayer of the match Amy Jones on TNT Sports: \"I was just trying to keep it as simple as possible and focus on one ball at a time. It sounds simple but I knew that if I did that then Deano and I would build a good partnership.\n\n\"I tried to be as positive as possible and, when the ball was in my areas, back myself. Then respect the good balls when they bowled in good areas as well.\n\n\"I've done a bit of work on mindset going into run-chases. It's an area I've felt I could do better in so I'm pleased that that work has paid off today.\"\n\nEngland captain Heather Knight: \"I felt like we were in a really good position [at the halfway stage]. The seamers, in particular, bowled really well.\n\n\"The way [Jones and Dean] soaked up pressure to build a partnership and then put the pressure back on the Kiwis was a lesson for us all.\"\n\nNew Zealand captain Amelia Kerr: \"Kate Cross bowled very well on that wicket. We didn't really have any answers to their changes of pace and variation.\n\n\"We were in a position to get 250-plus, but then you look at the bowling side of things and one more wicket and maybe we could have defended 200.\"", "Texas Republican Chip Roy tried and failed to stall the bill on Tuesday\n\nDespite a revolt among a handful of hard-line Republicans, a bipartisan deal to raise the US debt ceiling is set to reach the floor of the House of Representatives for a vote on Wednesday evening.\n\nIf a majority of legislators in the chamber approve, the bill will move on to the US Senate. Here's how the drama is playing out on Capitol Hill and a guide to what comes next.\n\nAfter months of negotiations, President Joe Biden and Republican Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy finally reached a deal to raise the amount of money the US can borrow, avoid a default on the national debt, and limit federal spending for the next two years.\n\nNow the pair are busy selling their weekend agreement to Congress. First up is the US House of Representatives, which is scheduled to hold a vote on the agreement on Wednesday evening. Republican and Democratic leaders there believe that even with some defections on the left and right, they have the votes to pass a bill - perhaps by a comfortable margin.\n\nThe legislation then moves to the Senate, which will pose new challenges to the agreement. Unlike the Republican-majority House, Democrats control the upper chamber with 51 out of its 100 seats. According to parliamentary rules, 60 votes are required to approve most bills - so some combination of Democratic and Republican votes will be needed.\n\nThose rules also offer individual senators broad powers to slow consideration of legislation for days. With the date when the US will hit its borrowing limit estimated by the US Treasury to be Monday 5 June, that leaves little margin for error or delay.\n\nOne conservative Republican, Mike Lee of Utah, has threatened to use \"every procedural tool\" to slow consideration of the deal. He, and other recalcitrant Republicans, may be mollified if Senate leadership allows the chamber to vote on changes to the deal.\n\nIf any of those changes are approved, however, it could threaten the carefully negotiated balance in the legislation and would almost certainly push final approval past 5 June.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: The debt ceiling explained - in under 90 seconds\n\nBoth Democratic and Republican leaders in the Senate are on board with the deal as it has been negotiated, and will be working to ensure that a final vote is taken quickly and the debt-limit deal reaches Mr Biden's desk for signature into law before a default can occur.\n\nFor the moment financial markets appear to have calmed as the prospect recedes of the global economic chaos that would result from the world's biggest economy defaulting on its $31.4 trillion (\u00a325tn) debt.\n\nThat could change, however, the closer the US approaches that Monday debt-limit deadline without significant progress in Congress. In 2011, the credit rating agency Standard & Poor's downgraded the US credit rating when similar brinksmanship pushed the nation close to its borrowing limit.\n\nThe path to selling the deal has been a rocky one so far. It became clear on Tuesday that some conservative hard-liners in the House would oppose the agreement.\n\nAt a press conference held on the steps of the US Capitol earlier on Tuesday, 11 members of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus railed against what they viewed as insufficient spending cuts and budget limitations in the compromise legislation.\n\n\"This deal fails completely,\" said congressman Scott Perry, the leader of the group. He said those who stood with him \"will be absolutely opposed to the deal and will do everything in our power to stop it\".\n\nThey also dodged when asked whether they would call for Mr McCarthy's removal - a step that would escalate the rift forming among Republicans in the House.\n\n\"No matter what happens, there's going to be a reckoning for what just occurred unless we stop this bill by tomorrow,\" congressman Chip Roy of Texas, another Freedom Caucus member, warned.\n\nThere may also be some defections in both the House and the Senate from left-wing Democrats, who have complained about how the proposed budget cuts fall exclusively on social programmes and objected to the new work requirements on some recipients of low-income aid.\n\nThe Democratic hard-liners, however, have been less organised - and less vocal in their objections - than their conservative counterparts.", "A Sheriff's office in Wisconsin responded to an unusual call by a driver, after a bobcat got stuck in a car grille.\n\nOfficials say the animal was unharmed and eventually set free back at the location where it entered the car.", "An eyewitness has captured the moment a large funnel cloud tore through a neighbourhood in the city of Greenwood, Indiana.

What a disgusting pair of Twits!\"\n\nThat sparked criticism for a \"negative representation\" of disability.\n\nJames and Smith, who write the popular Kid Normal books, have co-authored The Twits Next Door - part of a new series commissioned by the Roald Dahl Story Company.\n\nIn the video, the pair came up with ways to make the characters look \"really gross\" and \"horrible\".\n\nJames posted on X that it was \"absolutely not our intention\" to cause offence \"and we apologise unreservedly\".\n\nA host of modern authors will put a new spin on Roald Dahl's books\n\nHe wrote: \"We understand that words matter and we pride ourselves on championing and welcoming everyone into the magical world of children's books.

Well, we won\u2019t know just yet whether or not his evidence was enough to convince MPs that when - as he\u2019s admitted - he misled Parliament, he did not do so intentionally or recklessly, and corrected the record at the earliest opportunity.\n\nJohnson seemed at his most confident when he was able to draw on facts that suggest rule breaking wouldn\u2019t have been obvious to him - like that official photographers were present at times and that his birthday gathering was briefed to the Times newspaper. He looked more at ease here.\n\nIt got trickier for him when he started having his own social distancing guidance cited back at him.\n\nThe photographic evidence here became difficult for him as he was forced to explain how drinks gatherings demonstrated social distancing being followed \u201cwherever possible.\u201d\n\nHere he relied mostly on his belief these gatherings were \u201cessential\u201d for work.

Last week Meta announced its Quest 3 - which costs $499.\n\nApple said little about generative artificial intelligence - the buzzy technology that is the talk of Silicon Valley.\n\nThe company's share price fell slightly during the announcement, made at a developer's conference at Apple Park, the company's headquarters, in Cupertino, California.\n\nThe BBC was among the media outlets at the event, and technology editor Zoe Kleinman was one of the first people in the world to try out the headset.\n\n\"Since current boss Tim Cook took over in 2011, with the possible exception of the Watch, Apple has been unable to come up with the kind of world-changing product of the past,\" she said.\n\n\"Have they done it here?\"\n\nApple Vision Pro looks different to similar headsets on the market - and is more reminiscent of a pair of ski goggles than a virtual reality headset.\n\nApple used the phrase \"augmented reality\" to describe what the new device does.\n\nAugmented reality, also known as mixed reality, superimposes virtual objects in the world around us - enabling us to mix reality with virtual reality by looking through a screen.\n\n\"It's like your phone but right in front of you - big, bright and bold, wherever you are,\" Ms Kleinman said.\n\nIn letting you do things like watch videos of your family blowing out birthday candles or immerse yourself in your photography by making your panoramic photos life-size, she says it is pitched as a device which is \"very much about being part of your daily life\", unlike many other headsets on the market geared primarily towards immersive gaming.\n\nHow the Vision Pro's new app store will appear for headset users\n\nUsers can access apps, watch movies, and write documents in a virtual world. But so far, there is little evidence of a big market for this kind of wearable tech.\n\n\"It's still at the end of the day a VR headset,\" said Ms Kleinman. \"Apple is going to have to have an awful lot of content to throw at this when it ships early next year.\n\n\"And of course the other thing is the price point - $3,499 is a lot of money.\"\n\nHartley Charlton, senior editor of MacRumors, was unsure how much the headset would appeal to the general public.\n\n\"It won't appeal to mainstream consumers at first on account of its extremely high price point and immediate shortcomings as a first-generation device, such as its separate wired battery pack,\" he said.\n\nBut he said Apple has a track record of \"overcoming scepticism\" about new devices, and has historically encouraged people to \"part with their cash to add a new gadget to their repertoire\".\n\nJournalists and developers at Monday's conference saw a glimpse of the headset\n\nIn his sales pitch, Mr Cook said the headset allows users to \"see, hear and interact with digital content just like it's in your physical space\".\n\nIt is controlled by using a combination of your hands, eyes and voice - such as tapping your fingers together to select, and flicking them to scroll.\n\nThe announcement comes a week after Meta and Lenovo announced new iterations of their pre-existing virtual reality headsets, that do not superimpose objects on to a view of the real world.\n\nMeta has also invested heavily in mixed reality - but right now the sector is struggling.\n\nThe headset market saw a 54% drop in global sales last year, according to the International Data Corporation.\n\nApple's last major hardware release was for the Apple Watch device in 2015.\n\nThomas Husson, of Forrester Research, told BBC News it may take time for Apple's new headset to take off.\n\n\"The overall AR/VR space has been a bit overhyped over the past few years with the metaverse and that kind of experience,\" he said. \"That's the reason why I think it will take a bit more time.\n\n\"Having said that, if I told you 10 to 15 years ago that people would be ready to pay almost $2,000 for a mobile phone, I don't think many people would have said they would be willing to pay that.\"\n\nAside from the Vision Pro announcement, Apple also unveiled iOS17, the latest version of its iPhone operating system.\n\nUpdates include \"contact posters\" -

also a neighbour - 24-year-old George Heron.\n\nHe was prosecuted but acquitted at a trial in 1993 after a judge ruled police had used \"oppressive\" tactics when questioning him and said his confession had been obtained under duress.\n\nBoyd was familiar with the abandoned Old Exchange building about 300 yards from where he and Nikki lived, and knew how to get inside through a broken, boarded-up window.\n\nDNA matching his was found on Nikki's clothes and he bore a \"striking resemblance\" to a man seen with Nikki shortly before her death, prosecutors said.\n\nThe trial heard Boyd, of Chesterton Court in Norton, confessed to having sexual fantasies about young girls and was convicted of indecently assaulting a nine-year-old girl in 1999.\n\nHe also had a conviction for indecent exposure in 1997 when he flashed three young girls in a park and one for breaching the peace in 1986 when he grabbed a 10-year-old girl and asked her for a kiss.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nProsecutor Richard Wright KC previously told jurors Nikki was lured to the building by someone she knew and the \"irresistible conclusion\" was it was done for a \"sinister purpose\" even though there was no evidence of a sexual assault.\n\nHe said the case against Boyd was \"circumstantial but compelling\" but if he was not the murderer then Nikki must have been killed by a \"phantom\" who had left no evidence behind.\n\nThe jury of 10 women and two men in Boyd's trial reached their verdict after two-and-a-half hours of deliberation.\n\nThe public gallery erupted with raucous cheers and cries of \"thank you\" when the verdict was read out. Police officers had to be summoned into the court to restore order.\n\nBoyd, dressed in a white T-shirt, did not visibly react and was remanded into custody.\n\nNikki Allan was killed in the Old Exchange building in the Hendon area of Sunderland\n\nOutside court, Nikki's mother Sharon Henderson, who campaigned tirelessly to keep her daughter's case in the public consciousness, spoke of the \"injustice\" her family had lived with for three decades.\n\nAddressing the botched police investigation in 1992, she told reporters: \"This evil man slipped through the net to murder Nikki when he was on their files in the first place.\n\n\"Three doors down from Nikki's grandparents [where Boyd had been living]. They should have investigated him straight away.\"\n\nAsked how she had managed to keep fighting for justice, she replied: \"Because Nikki's my daughter and I love her.\"\n\nSpeaking after the verdict, Assistant Chief Constable Brad Howe of Northumbria Police praised Nikki's family's \"patience and strength over the last 30 years\", adding: \"Today is about justice for Nikki and her family.\"\n\n\"David Boyd hid his crime, lying about his involvement and prolonging the family's suffering, knowing all along that he had taken the life of their little girl,\" he said.\n\nHe said the investigation had been one of the \"most complex and comprehensive ever conducted\" by the force.\n\nDet Ch Supt Lisa Theaker, the senior investigating officer in the case, added: \"Nikki would have been 37 now and who knows what her life could have been.\n\n\"But her future was cruelly taken away from her by David Boyd. The pain and suffering that he has caused, and to so many people, is immeasurable.\"\n\nChristopher Atkinson, head of the Complex Casework Unit at Crown Prosecution Service North East, said: \"Despite the unimaginable grief endured by Nikki's family, Boyd continued to pretend that he was not involved in the killing for 30 years.\"\n\nFollow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

To do so, the jury would have needed to have been convinced that Mr Trump had engaged in non-consensual sexual intercourse with Ms Carroll.\n\nThe trial saw a tense cross-examination between Ms Carroll and Mr Trump's attorneys.\n\nHer legal team called 11 witnesses to corroborate her claims that Mr Trump had assaulted her in the lingerie department of the luxury store in 1995 or 1996.\n\nThey included two women who also say they were sexually assaulted by Mr Trump decades ago.

Police have told them that they cannot rule out the possibility of a so-called copycat attack, says Michael Tsifidaris, who speaks for the community here.\n\nHe's smartly dressed in a business suit, but looks exhausted. It's clear that he's still deeply shaken. Two of his friends were killed in the attack.\n\nHe tells us he spent Thursday night with survivors in hospital, and at the police station. But he also comforted relatives as they waited in a hastily arranged emergency centre for news of their loved ones.\n\n\"It's hard to imagine - a group of people are sitting together during an evening in the church, reading the Bible, singing, praying together. Then they spend a couple of minutes together to talk to each other after the meeting, Then, all of a sudden, a scene of love becomes a scene of hate and death.\"\n\nThe fact that the killer was a former member of the Jehovah's Witness community here makes the tragedy particularly hard to bear.\n\nThere are about 4,000 Jehovah's Witnesses in and around Hamburg. The community is divided into smaller congregations, each with their own meeting place, known as a Kingdom Hall.\n\nDetectives investigating the mass shooting have said the killer left the Jehovah's Witnesses on terms which were \"not good\".\n\nMr Tsifidaris says he doesn't know why the man left, didn't know him personally, and appears reluctant to talk about him.\n\nThose who leave the Jehovah's Witnesses are often \"disassociated\" or cut off by most members of the community; a practice sometimes referred to as \"shunning\".\n\nThe police have revealed they recently received an anonymous letter, in which the author warned the attacker had a gun, was mentally unstable and harboured anger against religious groups, including the Jehovah's Witnesses.\n\n\"He left the community two years ago and now, all of a sudden, he's showing up and is acting against all the principles we stand for,\" says Mr Tsifidaris.\n\n\"What we know is that in the religious context, there is a community he knows, there is a community he was part of, so this is a community he focused his hate on. He knew the premises, he knew the arrangements.\"\n\nFor now, the community is meeting online. Mr Tsifidaris, who refers to his fellow members as brothers and sisters, speaks often of the comfort to be found in supporting one another. \"We pray together, we cry together.\"\n\nUppermost in their thoughts are those who remain seriously injured in hospital.

A previous Fifpro study suggested that more than one in three footballers experience depressive symptoms.\n\nEarlier this year, Fifa announced equal conditions - but not equal prize money - for its women's and men's World Cup tournaments, including better travel provisions and private hotel rooms for each player.\n\nNow Fifpro are calling for equal conditions when it comes to the pathways to the World Cup as well.\n\n\"The obligations and pressures have increased with the upward trajectory of professionalisation but the conditions and wellbeing of players has either stayed the same or actually decreased,\" Dr Alex Culvin, Fifpro's head of research for women's football told the BBC's 100 Women.\n\nFor her, its crucial that the right care is offered to the more than half of players who reported either not receiving, or not being aware of, mental health support.\n\nFifpro says almost one in three players surveyed said they are not paid by their national team for these matches. More than half said they didn't get a pre-tournament medical examination.\n\n\"It is not an environment that supports players to be at their best all of the time,\" says Sarah Gregorius, Fifpro's director of strategic relations for women's football.\n\nWhen it comes to pre-tournament medicals, she says, \"the numbers on their own are quite shocking and dangerous\".\n\nShe wants to see all players offered one and anything less is \"completely unacceptable\".\n\nMany countries have a long history of men's professional football and experts say this established infrastructure is partly why medical care for male players is more consistent compared to women's football.\n\n\"Because of the limited number of [women's] professional clubs who offer professional standards... the need for women players to have these tests done at the international level is greater,\" says Dr Culvin.\n\nShe points to the Confederation of African Football (Caf) as an example of what can be achieved - its players reported a much higher likelihood of receiving adequate health checks compared to players at other confederation championships.\n\n\"Caf had made a real effort to give a medical and an ECG [electrocardiogram - to check heart rhythms] to all of the players... so when confederations make it a priority, the data can shift,\" she says.\n\nNearly all of those who took part in the Fifpro research said that pay and prize money needed to be improved.\n\nAlmost one third of those surveyed said they had to take unpaid leave from other employment to take part in qualifying rounds.\n\n\"Players have to make a choice between competing for their national team in international tournaments or maintaining their second job and another source of income.

It has also ended its joint ventures with the state energy giant Gazprom.\n\nAnd it said it would start a \"phased withdrawal from Russian petroleum products, pipeline gas and LNG\". But it warned that it would be a \"complex challenge\".\n\nShell said last year it would close all its service stations in Russia\n\nSince then, it has kept taking cargoes of LNG from two Russian ports, the one at Yamal and one at Sakhalin in the far east.\n\nShell used to be a minority investor in the Sakhalin gas project, but abandoned that claim in September last year after the Russian government transferred its shares to a local business - and since then has taken no gas from Sakhalin.\n\nBut it still honours the contract with the Russian LNG company Novatek, which obliges it to buy 900,000 tonnes a year from Yamal until the 2030s, according to the Reuters news agency.\n\nNovatek is Russia's second biggest gas company, and the taxes it pays are a significant contributor to the Russian government's budget.\n\nOleg Ustenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian president, said: \"It is quite simple: by continuing to trade in Russian gas Shell is putting money into Putin's pockets and helping to fund Russia's brutal aggression against the people of Ukraine.\n\n\"The vast sums that Shell and the whole oil industry have made in Russia should be used to help fund the reconstruction of Ukraine, rather than lining the pockets of their shareholders.\"\n\nA spokesman for Shell said: \"Shell has stopped buying Russian LNG on the spot market, but still has some long-term contractual commitments. This is in full compliance with sanctions, applicable laws and regulations of the countries in which we operate.\n\n\"There is a dilemma between putting pressure on the Russian government over its atrocities in Ukraine and ensuring stable, secure energy supplies. It is for governments to decide on the incredibly difficult trade-offs that must be made.\"\n\nShell is the world's largest trader of LNG, which is not subject to European sanctions, making billions of dollars in profits trading oil and gas last year.\n\nRussia massively reduced its deliveries of gas by pipeline last year, but it has increased the amount of gas it supplies by ship, including to Europe.\n\nThe UK has not imported any Russian gas for over a year, while EU politicians are trying to reduce the amount of Russian LNG the bloc imports. In March, the EU's Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson called on countries and firms to stop buying Russian gas, and not to sign new contracts.\n\n\"It's long overdue that the trading of Russian LNG is looked at with the same disgust as Russian oil trading. Targeting Putin's energy income cannot be about symbolic measures but must concretely put a stop to the huge fossil fuel sums that cement his power,\" said Jonathan Noronha-Gant, senior campaigner at Global Witness.\n\nThe France-based energy company TotalEnergies is a minority shareholder in the Yamal project, and was also a major trader in Russian LNG, the Global Witness analysis reported.\n\nThe BBC has approached TotalEnergies for comment.", "Katie Boulter won her first WTA title with a dominant victory in Nottingham over Jodie Burrage in the first all-British tour-level final in 46 years.\n\nThe British women's number one ranking was also on the line as Boulter outplayed her good friend 6-3 6-3.\n\n\"I'm definitely going to be sleeping with this trophy tonight,\" Boulter said in her on-court interview.\n\nEarlier, Andy Murray won the men's event as Britons find form on grass before next month's Wimbledon.\n\nBoulter and Burrage were contesting the first all-British WTA final since Sue Barker beat Virginia Wade in San Francisco on 28 February 1977.\n\nBoth players were also appearing in their first WTA finals after excellent performances in Nottingham this week but it was Boulter who took control from the start.\n\nThe day's order of play had been changed because of the forecast of rain, and with dark clouds hanging heavy, Boulter stormed into a 5-1 lead with a double break in the opening set.\n\nBut she then failed to serve it out at the first opportunity as Burrage's forehand clicked. That was the only blip for the 26-year-old though as she immediately broke back to seal the set.\n\nShe barely paused for breath at the start of the second, taking the first two games to love and faced her only real challenge at 3-1 when she had to fend off break point with a stunning backhand winner.\n\nBoulter delivered her first ace of the match when she was serving for victory but she missed her first match point when she sent a backhand narrowly wide - Burrage's puff of the cheeks a big indication of just how close that had been. But she was soon celebrating victory when 24-year-old Burrage sent a forehand long.\n\nThe pair shared a warm hug at the net and then sat next to each other chatting and laughing while they waited for the trophy presentation at the end of a memorable week for both of them.\n\n\"I dreamed of this moment, to win this tournament, as a little girl when I was four years old,\" said an emotional Boulter, who considers this her home tournament after growing up in Leicester.\n\n\"Having come here as a fan and now as a player and somehow finding a way to win it means more than everything to me.\"\n\nBoulter, who took over as British number one from the injured Emma Raducanu last week, is now set to rise into the world's top 80 on Monday for the first time in a career that has been disrupted by injuries over the years.\n\nThe home success at the British grass-court tournaments this year has come just a few weeks after criticism of the state of tennis in the country when no British women appeared in the main draw of the singles at the French Open and only three men did.\n\nBritish player Dan Evans had suggested that Raducanu's 2021 US Open victory had \"papered over the cracks\" in British tennis.\n\nLess than four weeks after those comments, Murray has won back-to-back tournaments here and at Surbiton last week, while three of the women's semi-finalists at Nottingham were British.\n\nThere were also Britons in the women's doubles final, where Heather Watson and Harriet Dart lost to Norway's Ulrikke Eikeri and Estonia's Ingrid Neel, while on Saturday Jacob Fearnley and Johannus Monday won an all-British men's doubles final against Liam Broady and Jonny O'Mara.\n\nThere are far stronger fields at some of the next grass-court tournaments before Wimbledon at Eastbourne, Queen's and Birmingham but there will also be a new sense of confidence among some of the Britons who have enjoyed their best tournaments, including Boulter and Burrage.\n\nBurrage said it had been \"such a positive week\" and that she had proven \"a lot of things\" to herself, while Boulter added: \"I've played so many British players, we appreciate an all-British final and what an incredible achievement it is.\n\n\"I don't doubt we [Burrage and I] will be back here playing more finals.\"\n\u2022 None Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone", "Five days into the worst fighting in months between Israel and militant groups in Gaza, concern is mounting about the humanitarian situation in the Palestinian territory.\n\nIt is estimated that more than 200 patients, mostly with cancer, are unable to leave for urgently needed treatment. They include children.\n\nIsrael controls two crossings with Gaza - used for people and goods - which have been closed since the start of its military operation on Tuesday.\n\nOperators of the sole power plant in the impoverished strip - which relies on Israeli fuel imports - say it will be forced to close in three days.\n\nA spokesman told the BBC this would \"lead to an exacerbation of the humanitarian problems\". The plant supplies about half of the electricity in the territory, where some 2.3 million Palestinians live.\n\nDina el-Dhani, a Palestinian cancer patient in Gaza City, says she missed her scheduled treatment in Jerusalem\n\nA British surgeon who is among an estimated 140 humanitarian workers currently stranded in Gaza says cancer patients are facing potentially life-threatening delays.\n\nProf Nick Maynard, a consultant surgeon at Oxford University Hospitals, arrived in Gaza City last week as part of an aid programme teaching advanced cancer surgery to Palestinian doctors.\n\n\"The doctors I work with here have got multiple examples of people who are in desperate need of cancer treatment,\" Prof Maynard told the BBC.\n\n\"These treatments are undoubtedly being delayed and potentially leading to deaths because of the delays now,\" he added.\n\nProf Maynard said he was one of about a dozen non-resident British nationals stuck in Gaza.\n\nZiyad al-Za'noun, 70, has cancer of the spinal cord and is treated every week at Istishari Hospital in Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.\n\n\"I have been suffering from cancer for three years and there is no treatment for it here in Gaza,\" he said.\n\n\"On Tuesday, I was scheduled to go for a chemotherapy session in Ramallah, but we were surprised by the closure of Erez crossing.\n\n\"My health condition is getting worse, and I am using painkillers to overcome the pain, and my psychological condition is also deteriorating,\" Ziyad al-Za'noun added.\n\nIsrael tightened its blockade of Gaza in 2007 after it was taken over by the Islamist militant group Hamas, citing security concerns.\n\nHamas does not recognise Israel's right to exist and is designated as a terrorist group by Israel and many other countries.\n\nGaza's hospitals face severe shortages of medical equipment and medicines largely due to the blockade, but also because of internal Palestinian political divisions.\n\nMany cancer patients need to leave for medical treatment; they have to apply for Israeli permits to exit via the Erez crossing. Most of those who get these are transferred to Augusta Victoria Hospital in occupied East Jerusalem.\n\nMore than 90 patients - six of them children with cancer - were due to arrive there in the past week but could not travel, according to Dr Fadi al-Atrash, the hospital's chief executive.\n\n\"There is always a need to refer patients primarily to Augusta Victoria and even other hospitals in the West Bank,\" Dr Fadi said.\n\n\"It's because of the lack of services in Gaza, lack of drugs, human resources and appropriate infrastructure.\"\n\nWhen the current hostilities end, patients and relatives accompanying them will have to apply for new Israeli permits to leave Gaza.\n\n\"When the checkpoints are open, there will be another process for permits. More time will be taken to arrange their exit from Gaza to the hospital and that will add to the delay in their treatment that they have suffered from in the past week,\" Dr Fadi said.\n\nAlready Gaza's power plant is reducing the amount of electricity it generates, to try to save its fuel reserves. If it shuts down, this will have an impact on many different services.\n\n\"Preventing the entry of fuel shipments threatens it with a complete stop and will prevent the Gaza Electricity Distribution Company from supplying vital facilities such as hospitals, waste pumps and treatment plants, potable water wells and desalination plants,\" said Muhammad Thabet, a spokesman for the company.\n\nNormally, some 300 lorryloads of goods enter Gaza each day through the Kerem Shalom commercial crossing with Israel.\n\nIn past conflicts, there would have been serious food shortages after several days of closure. However, recently Egypt has eased its tight restrictions on the Palestinian territory, which means food and other goods are continuing to enter.\n\nFor now, supermarkets still have stocks of basic items - but many shelves are empty, prompting shoppers to form long queues as they start stockpiling.\n\nIsrael's military-run authority that controls entry into Gaza said its crossings had been under the constant threat of rocket fire and remained shut this week.\n\nThe Israeli defence ministry said on Saturday that Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) militants had fired dozens of mortars at Erez and Kerem Shalom since Tuesday.\n\nIt also posted what it said was security camera footage showing a blast caused by a mortar fired at Erez.\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

the nosferatu,\" he said.\n\n\"All of this, Bram got from Emily Gerard, and he was able to insert it into the book he was working on.\n\n\"She even helped him set the story in Transylvania, as he was originally setting it in Austria.\"\n\nChristopher Lee in the film role of Dracula\n\nMs Gerard - the eldest daughter of Colonel Archibald Gerard and Euphemia Erskine - is believed to have been born at Chesters estate, outside Jedburgh, in 1849.\n\nThe family had moved to Lanarkshire during her childhood before relocating to Austria.\n\nAlong with her younger sister, Dorothea, she collaboratively wrote at least four published novels, while individually writing essays and reviews for several periodicals.\n\nAfter her marriage to Polish cavalry officer Ritter Miecislaus von Laszowski in 1869, she continued to carve out a career as an essayist and novelist.\n\nBut it was when her husband was posted to Transylvania, in the early 1880s, that Emily's writing turned towards the myths and superstitions she encountered in and around the Carpathian mountain villages.\n\nDacre explained: \"She is a bit of a mystery.\n\n\"I want to find out what gave her the courage and passion to explore, on her own, the superstitions and beliefs of the locals.\n\n\"These were delicate issues - pagan beliefs - that must have been difficult for her to investigate.\n\n\"I want to find out the roots of Emily Gerard here in Scotland that gave her the passion and courage to do what she did.\"\n\nOver the coming months Dacre and other researchers hope to discover more about Emily Gerard while also raising her profile.\n\nGloria Anderson, who runs Experience Transylvania tours, said: \"It is amazing how I recognize so much about Transylvania in Emily Gerard's writings, although it was almost 150 years ago when she wrote it all.\n\n\"Her language and approach are very modern -

This means many dentists are operating at a loss.\n\nThe BDA has asked the Scottish government to bring payment reform forward.\n\nMs Waite said: \"If they don't sort out and reform the funding of this system there is a real risk that they will lose even more dentists from the NHS service.\"\n\nA Scottish government spokesperson said NHS Highland had now received expressions of interest for opening new dental practices, and the government would work with the health board to provide funding support if the applications were successful.\n\nThe government is also continuing to work \"apace\" on payment reform.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "The Ireland women's rugby team has chosen to swap their traditional white shorts and make a permanent switch to navy because of period concerns.\n\nThe move comes as a response to feedback from players about playing in white rugby kit during their period.\n\nThe new Ireland kit will be seen for the first time at the Women's Six Nations launch in London on Wednesday and throughout the tournament.\n\nIreland will begin their campaign against Wales on Saturday 25 March.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Ulster in January, Gillian McDarby, the head of Women's Performance at IRFU, said the organisation were in talks about the change with kit supplier Canterbury of New Zeland after consulting the players.\n\nThey say they will give other rugby players and teams at all levels who have purchased white women's Canterbury shorts the opportunity to claim a free pair in a different colour.\n\nIreland International Enya Breen, said: \"The top way to ensure we perform to our best on the field is by removing any unnecessary distractions.

Marsh has 31 and Cameron Green three.\n\nWith more bad weather forecast for Sunday, England are left hoping for enough time to force the win that would level the series at 2-2 and turn the fifth Test at The Oval into a decider.\n\nThough victory is now almost out of the question for Australia, a draw would be enough for them to retain the urn.\n\u2022 None How day four at Old Trafford unfolded\n\u2022 None England will win 3-2 if they win fourth Test - Vaughan\n\nThis series has produced three thrilling Tests, with the drama in the fourth now coming through England's battle with the weather. It would be a huge anti-climax if the rain has a decisive say in the destination of the Ashes urn.\n\nEngland were fortunate to get any play on Saturday. Overnight rain persisted into the morning and early afternoon, but the ground was readied at a remarkable speed. The empty stands filled rapidly as news of a start filtered through.\n\nThough the overheads were ideal and the crowd expectant, England were blocked by an unresponsive surface - there was no sign of the uneven bounce from earlier in the match - and the determination of Labuschagne and Marsh.\n\nThe reverse swing of Friday evening also disappeared as the ball became wet. When England persuaded the umpires to change it and looked to bring Mark Wood into the attack, they were told the light was not fit enough for pace. It turned out to be a blessing in disguise, as Root proved to be the most threatening bowler.\n\nEngland will return on Sunday wishing for the weather to be kind. There is the possibility of 98 overs of play and second new ball available nine overs into the day.\n\nFor Australia, they will not only be looking to repel England, but also build a lead to make the hosts' route to victory longer. Their inclusion of both Marsh and Green in this Test, extending the batting line-up, was done partly with this scenario in mind.\n\nLabuschagne delivers when Australia need it most\n\nThis has been a difficult series for Labuschagne. Beginning ranked as the world's number one Test batter, he had not managed a half-century before this match.\n\nHe hinted at a return to form with 51 in the first innings and then delivered what could yet prove to be an Ashes-saving hundred.\n\nWith Australia 113-4 overnight, Labuschagne began on 44 and Marsh one. Though Labuschagne took a painful blow on the finger from a Wood bouncer, he was largely untroubled by England's short-ball plan.\n\nMarsh, usually so aggressive, was a calm foil. He has struck only four fours in a 107-ball stay and two of those came in successive deliveries from Chris Woakes, who spent time off the field suffering from stiffness.\n\nWhen Root came on, Labuschagne lofted two sixes over long-on, but also flashed an edge off an arm-ball past slip Zak Crawley when he was on 93.\n\nHe went to his 11th Test ton by pinching a single off Moeen Ali before making an error attempting to cut Root and was given out on review.\n\nGiven the stakes and urgency of the situation, this was a curiously flat performance from England's seamers.\n\nThey got little movement from the ball or the pitch and chewed up precious time as they deliberated over field placings and tactics.\n\nA bouncer plan achieved little other than knocking the ball out of shape, after which came the stroke of luck with Wood being denied the chance to bowl, resulting in the call to Moeen and Root.\n\nWhile Moeen mixed some dangerous bounce with regular loose deliveries, Root constantly made things happen.\n\nHe was convinced on-field umpire Nitin Menon had made a mistake for the Labuschagne wicket, celebrating towards the Party Stand even before the review was complete. In the same over, an inside edge off Marsh went in and out of the fingers of bat-pad fielder Harry Brook.\n\nGreen survived a review off Moeen from the final ball before the tea break. England would have been happy to bowl more spin after the interval, only to be denied the opportunity.\n\nAustralia batter Marnus Labuschagne, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It's always very special getting a Test hundred. It doesn't happen too often but I'm disappointed I couldn't get us to tea.\n\n\"We were so close to having a tremendous day there. For us, this is about saving this Test match and retaining the Ashes.\"\n\nEngland batting coach Marcus Trescothick: \"We got more play than we expected. It looked like a complete washout so it's a bonus. We're one wicket closer but it's still frustrating.\n\n\"It really does depend on the weather. We wanted to get two or three wickets today and we'll take any play we can tomorrow.\"\n\nBBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew: \"England were a bit flat. There wasn't much of their usual chatter and the noise from the players you get when you are going for a win.\"", "Ch Supt Richard North said they are \"using all resources available to us\" to investigate the attack\n\nCounter-terror police are involved in an investigation into a man being set alight as he walked home from a mosque.\n\nA man has been held on suspicion of attempted murder after the attack in Edgbaston, Birmingham, on Monday.\n\nThe West Midlands and Metropolitan forces are looking into whether there is a link to a similar attack in Ealing, west London last month.\n\nThe Birmingham victim, in his 70s, was approached, sprayed with a substance and had his jacket set on fire.\n\nNeighbours told the BBC they helped to put the flames out and carry the victim to his home where he was treated by paramedics.\n\nHis son said his father was \"very badly burned\" and they were praying for his recovery.\n\nHe was taken to hospital with burns to his face which are serious but not thought to be life-threatening.

You get excited. And then everything just changes again.\"\n\nCharlotte lives with intestinal failure caused by a severe form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which weakens her body's connective tissue.\n\nShe was admitted to St James's Hospital in Leeds in June 2022 following an infection, and a new Hickman line - a tube that allows feeding and the administering of pain relief - was inserted.\n\nBy November, Charlotte was told she was well enough to be cared for at home, but she remains in hospital following delays in the hiring and training of staff able to support her.\n\nWith limited access to a hoist which would enable her to use her wheelchair, Charlotte said she had spent 10 months \"stuck in bed\".\n\nCharlotte celebrated her birthday in her hospital bed\n\nBecause of the complexity of her condition, Charlotte only has months to live. She believes her situation merits greater urgency because of the increased risk of infection in hospital.\n\nEach time one of the Hickman lines becomes infected, the choice available for adding a new line reduces.\n\nCharlotte's family worry that with the limited options remaining, in addition to the ongoing pain she lives with, Charlotte may soon have to decide to move to an end-of-life pathway. This would imply she only has weeks left to live.\n\nCharlotte qualifies for 24-hour home care support through the NHS Continuing Healthcare scheme, but she said decisions over how this would be put in place had been slow and unclear.\n\nShe said she was initially told to hire care workers from a company whose staff members were not qualified to meet her complex needs, causing weeks of delays.\n\nHer local NHS Trust later agreed that if she hired personal assistants (PAs) it would train them in specialist pain relief techniques.\n\nBut by the time Charlotte and her family found people for the role, the trust said the training could no longer be provided.\n\nIt has now been agreed that Charlotte can train her own PAs, but there have been subsequent delays caused by issues obtaining the necessary pain relief equipment.\n\nCharlotte's mother, Denise, says time together as a family has been lost\n\n\"We've gone round in circles, and the time-wasting is Charlotte's life.

For more than a week they've been among the thousands confined to their homes, trapped by intense fighting between the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF).\n\nHundreds of foreign nationals have already been evacuated, but the UK has faced growing criticism from many of its citizens who say they have been essentially abandoned.\n\nWhile the UK Foreign Office said over the weekend that it had managed to evacuate embassy staff from the capital Khartoum, it is feared that hundreds of other citizens remain trapped.\n\nIn dozens of conversations with the BBC, those stuck on the ground have complained of poor communication from the Foreign Office's crisis centre.\n\nA small British military reconnaissance team is in Sudan to assess evacuation options, BBC News understands.\n\nAnd on Monday, Foreign Office minister Andrew Mitchell warned that movement in Khartoum \"remains extremely dangerous and no evacuation option comes without grave risk to life\".\n\nHe said a member of the French special forces was \"gravely ill\" after being shot while trying to evacuate French diplomats.\n\nBut some UK citizens say they have waited too long for help.\n\nOne British citizen - William - told the BBC he had received virtually no assistance from government officials since the conflict began more than a week ago.\n\nHe was forced to brave the street fighting to flee Khartoum after his situation became \"intolerable\".\n\n\"We've had absolutely nothing but nonsense from the government,\" he told the Today programme on Monday.\n\n\"Not even nonsense, we've had nothing. The last communication was that the government itself is going to do nothing, so we had to take this option.\"\n\nHis story mirrored that of other British citizens - who have watched on in dismay as their international counterparts have been evacuated by other governments.\n\n\"We feel abandoned,\" Edinburgh native Fatima Osman, who was visiting family when the violence began, told the BBC from Khartoum.\n\n\"It's very traumatising here and the situation is very bad, it's getting worse. The clashes, the fighting, and there are dead bodies everywhere. And everyone is trying to escape and flee the country, and you can see the country is really getting into a civil war.\"\n\nHer husband, Amar Osman, said their experience of trying to get advice from the Foreign Office had left him infuriated.\n\n\"I filled the location form on the [Foreign Office] website and I received an email saying they've received my form,\" he told the Today programme as the sound of gunfire echoed nearby.\n\n\"But nothing else.

Two air force planes and a naval vessel were on standby to evacuate the group.\n\nAnd long queues of United Nations vehicles and buses were seen leaving Khartoum on Sunday, also heading east towards Port Sudan and carrying \"citizens from all over the world\", a Sierra Leonean evacuee told AFP news agency.\n\nOne of the first nations to evacuate citizens was Saudi Arabia. On Sunday, 91 of the Kingdom's citizens and 66 nationals of 12 other \"friendly countries\" were flown from Port Sudan to the city of Jeddah across the Red Sea.\n\nStefano Rebora - president of Italian NGO Music for Peace - was evacuated on an emergency flight by the Italian embassy on Sunday.\n\n\"At 12.30am we got the call from the crisis unit [of the Italian foreign ministry],\" he told the BBC. \"They said they would attempt an airlift the next day and told us to go to a meeting point.\"\n\nAfter meeting other Italian nationals at the embassy, Mr Rebora travelled in a convoy to an airfield about 20km (12 miles) away from Khartoum.\n\n\"It took us four hours to cover 20km,\" he recalled. \"On the way we saw bodies everywhere - there's no security whatsoever so nobody dares go collect them - but there's utter destruction too.\"\n\nElizabeth Boughey, a British teacher at Khartoum American School, was evacuated by the French embassy to Djibouti, alongside 200 other people of various nationalities.\n\nShe said the group - which included a number of UK nationals - was taken to an airfield in northern Khartoum and flown out on two specially chartered military planes.\n\nMeanwhile, satellite photos appeared to show a Hercules C-130 transport plane on the ground at Port Sudan airfield on Sunday at 08:04 local time (10:04 BST).\n\nReports online suggested the plane may have been either a Jordanian or a South Korean aircraft known to have been in the area at the time.\n\nSome UK nationals have turned down alternative offers of evacuation from friends, family and other nations, as they believed they had assurances of evacuations from UK officials.\n\nDr Javid Abdelmoneim told the BBC that his elderly father has spent the past week trapped in his apartment in Garden City near Khartoum where he was observing the month of Ramadan.\n\nDuring a conversation with Foreign Office officials, Dr Abdelmoneim's family were told his father would be placed \"high on the evacuation list given that he is elderly and lives alone\".\n\nBut he said Sunday's announcement that the UK embassy in Khartoum had been evacuated took the family by surprise.\n\n\"We have been dutifully waiting and said no to cousins leaving [in a convoy] to Port Sudan and Egypt. Our working assumption was Dad was going with the British embassy,\" Dr Abdelmoneim said.\n\n\"My sister called the crisis cell after Sunday's announcement. She asked them directly whether they were planning evacuation for British citizens and they didn't answer the question.\n\n\"All they (the FCDO) had to do is tweet out that British citizens are not being evacuated. Their communication has increased his chance of coming to harm and decreased his chance of leaving safely.\"\n\nAmar Osman told the BBC that as confusion reigned and the fighting continued on Monday, he was considering taking the dangerous route out of Khartoum by road himself.\n\nThousands of Sudanese have already taken this perilous route out of the capital. Last week, the BBC witnessed hundreds of people boarding buses and flatbed trucks at bus stations across the city.\n\nBut that option is fraught with danger.\n\nThe RSF is said to have set up roadblocks on major roads around Khartoum.\n\nMs Boughey told the BBC her group was stopped and robbed of around $500 (\u00a3402) by RSF troops while moving around the city last Wednesday.\n\nNonetheless, the risk hasn't stopped people trying to leave by road.\n\nOne British woman - who asked not to be named - told the BBC that she and her relatives had rented a bus and driven to the Egyptian border after not hearing back from the British embassy in Khartoum.\n\n\"British citizens have not been given any information, the power to the mobile networks and the internet has now gone down to people won't be able to receive any information,\" she said.\n\n\"Meanwhile Dutch nationals, Greek nationals, Italian nationals, people we know are being flown from airstrips just outside of Khartoum to safety. That is citizens, not even embassy people.\n\n\"And because there's been such a breakdown in communication it turns out British citizens would have been able to get on those flights but they were advised to stay in by the British government.\"\n\nYousra - a London based accountant who was in Khartoum for her wedding - fled the capital by bus.\n\nShe managed to find transportation from the adjoining city of Omdurman to the northern city of Dongola, before waiting 24 hours in the searing heat to cross the Egyptian border.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC on Monday, the chair of the UK Parliament's foreign affairs committee, Alicia Kearns MP, accused the government of learning \"no lessons\" from the chaotic evacuation of Afghanistan in 2021.\n\n\"The reality is we have to get British nationals out,\" she told the Today programme.\n\n\"If however, there was to be no evacuation because it is too dangerous... then we have a moral obligation to tell British nationals as soon as possible that that is the judgement that has been made, because they then need to be able to make their own decision.\"\n\nIn a statement to the BBC, a government spokesperson defended the Foreign Office's efforts, and said that officials were \"working alongside international partners and doing all we can to ensure the safe passage of our citizens in what remains a very challenging context\".\n\nMr Mitchell told parliament that the situation on the ground remained \"extremely grave\", but promised to look at every possibility to get British nationals out of Sudan.\n\nBut the overwhelming sentiments expressed to the BBC on Monday were anger and frustration.\n\n\"We got nothing other than the government update every day which still says shelter in place, which is a joke,\" Ms Boughey told the BBC.\n\n\"In comparison with what we've seen other embassies doing, including some much smaller embassies, I don't know what the Brits did do except get some of their own out.\"\n\nKayleen Devlin, Laura Gozzi, Chris Bell, Olga Robinson and Natasha Booty also contributed to reporting for this story.\n\nAre you a British national who has been evacuated from Sudan?

They were sunk by Japanese torpedoes on 10 December 1941.\n\nThe strike - which occurred just three days after the attack on the US fleet in Pearl Harbour - killed some 842 sailors and is considered one of the worst disasters in British naval history.\n\nThe HMS Repulse was sunk by Japanese forces in 1941\n\nFishermen and divers first reported the presence of the foreign vessel to Malaysia authorities last month.\n\nLocal maritime police detained the Chinese ship on Sunday. The ship, registered in Fuzhou, had 32 crew on board, the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA) said in a statement.\n\nCannon shells \"suspected to be from World War Two\" were uncovered during a search of the vessel. Malaysian agencies are also investigating the provenance of the ammunition.\n\nThe MMEA added that it is linked to a cache of unexploded artillery, said to be from the two sunken vessels, that police seized from a private scrap yard in the southern state of Johor earlier this month.\n\nIn 2017, during a tour of Malaysia, a local diver showed the then Prince Charles images that documented damage to the HMS Prince of Wales inflicted by scavengers.\n\nThe Defence Secretary at the time responded by saying the UK would work with Malaysian and Indonesian governments to investigate claims that up to six British warships had been plundered in their waters.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. \"Patients paying the price\" for strikes, NHS chief executive Amanda Pritchard says\n\nThe head of NHS England has warned that July's planned strikes in the health service could be the worst yet for patients.\n\nAmanda Pritchard said industrial action across the NHS had already caused \"significant\" disruption - and that patients were paying the price.\n\nThis month's consultant strike will bring a \"different level of challenge\" than previous strikes, she said.\n\nJunior doctors and consultants will strike for a combined seven days.\n\nMs Pritchard told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that the work of consultants - who are striking for the first time in a decade - cannot be covered \"in the same way\" as junior doctors.\n\n\"The hard truth is that it is patients that are paying the price for the fact that all sides have not yet managed to reach a resolution,\" she said.\n\nLast month, junior doctors in England voted for five days of strikes in mid-July - their longest strike yet.\n\nThey will walk out between Thursday 13 July and Tuesday 18 July after rejecting a government pay offer.\n\nA few days after that strike ends, on 20 and 21 July, hospital consultants in England will strike over pay.\n\nNegotiators for consultants and junior doctors have been asking for a 35% pay increase to make up for what they say are 15 years of below-inflation rises - a figure Health Secretary Steve Barclay called unaffordable.\n\nInstead, junior doctors have been offered a 5% rise this year, which was rejected, while there has been no offer so far for consultants.\n\nConsultants are also calling for reforms to the doctors' pay review body to ensure the issue is \"fixed for the future\". Mr Barclay told Laura Kuenssberg he is \"ready to have discussions\" on other issues, such as how consultants' pay progresses over time.\n\nHealth Secretary Steve Barclay said he was prepared to negotiate with consultants\n\n\"There's things we're open to discussing, but we need to get the balance right,\" he said.\n\nThe health service has been plagued by strike action throughout this year, with doctors, nurses, ambulance workers, porters and others walking out in disputes, mainly over pay.\n\nA breakthrough came in May, when unions representing all NHS staff except doctors and dentists backed a deal to receive a 5% pay rise.\n\nHowever, junior doctors and hospital consultants have still not reached an agreement with the government.\n\nHealth is a devolved issue, meaning this only relates to the NHS in England.\n\nMs Pritchard acknowledged that it would be several years before the situation in the health sector returned to anything like good enough, and stressed that the service was doing all it could to bring waiting lists down.\n\nNHS England says more than 600,000 appointments have been cancelled in previous strikes. The ongoing failure of the government and some of the medical unions to find agreement is only going to crank the pressure up still further.\n\nMs Pritchard called for the industrial action to be brought to an end as soon as possible, saying it cannot become \"business as usual in the NHS\".\n\nShe also discussed NHS England's new 15-year workforce plan, which she introduced alongside Prime Minister Rishi Sunak earlier this week.\n\nThe NHS currently has one out of every 10 posts unfilled, creating major pressure on staff and leading to long waiting times for patients.\n\nThe new plan is focused on training and retaining more staff. Ms Pritchard said the plan is not an \"overnight\" fix , but that it is part of efforts to \"treat people as quickly as possible, without delay\".\n\nAlso on the show was former Conservative health minister Lord Bethell who described the current approach to treatment in the NHS as \"rationing\".\n\n\"If someone has a need for an operation and you simply don't have the resources to give them what they need then you are going beyond the important protocols of allocating scarce resources in the best way possible and you are being defined by the amount of resources that you have available,\" he said.\n\n\"I think that there is a difference between reasonable allocation of resources and making tough decision which is part of every day life, and having to cope with a system as overwhelmed with illness.\"", "Canon Patrick McAntee has been told not to have contact with anyone under 16\n\nA County Tyrone priest has appeared in court charged with indecent assault against two males.\n\nCanon Patrick McEntee, 69, from Esker Road in Dromore, is a former teacher, governor and college president at St Michael's College in Enniskillen.\n\nHe is charged with indecently assaulting one male between 1980 and 1981.\n\nHe is further accused of indecently assaulting a second male between 1988 and 1989.\n\nCanon McEntee appeared at Enniskillen Magistrates' Court where he was asked if he understood the charges and he replied: \"I do, yes.\"\n\nA police officer confirmed she could connect him to the charges.\n\nThe court was told that the prosecution file is at an early stage.\n\nCanon McEntee was released on his own bail of \u00a3500.\n\nThe district judge told him that he must have no contact directly or indirectly with the injured parties.\n\nHe was also told not to have contact with any young person under the age of 16.\n\nOriginally from County Monaghan, Canon McEntee taught religious studies at St Michael's and was college president from 1994 until 2000.\n\nHe has been a priest for more than 45 years and since 2001 has served as the parish priest of St Davog's in Dromore.\n\nIn March the Diocese of Clogher announced he had been granted a leave of absence while an alleged safeguarding issue was investigated.\n\nA diocesan spokesperson said: \"Canon Patrick McEntee is on leave while a safeguarding matter is dealt with and will continue to be on leave from ministry until all due processes have been completed.\"\n\nThe case was adjourned until 21 August.", "A Donald Trump fan dresses up as the former president at the rally\n\nIn his first public appearance since speculating a week ago that he would soon be arrested, Donald Trump lashed out against the multiple criminal inquiries that have bedevilled him since he left office in January 2021.\n\nAt an airfield rally in Waco, Texas, in front of thousands of supporters, the former president called the New York City investigation into hush-money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels an expletive.\n\n\"The district attorney of New York under the auspices and direction of the 'department of injustice' in Washington, DC, is investigating me for something that is not a crime, not a misdemeanour, not an affair,\" he said, before belittling Ms Daniels' personal appearance.\n\nEvery piece of his personal, financial and business life, he said, has been \"turned upside down and dissected\" - but professed that he was \"the most innocent man in the history of our country\".\n\nFor the past week, Mr Trump has been posting increasingly menacing statements about \"death and destruction\" if he were to be indicted on his social media website, but he avoided any such dire warnings during his speech. And earlier on a sunny afternoon in Waco, Texas, the gathering felt more like the carnival-atmosphere campaign rallies of Mr Trump's 2016 presidential bid.\n\nThousands of the former president's supporters wandered through Trump merchandise tents, where they bought t-shirts emblazoned with \"God, guns and Trump\" and \"Trump won\". Then they packed onto the asphalt tarmac of the local airport hours before Mr Trump's private jet was scheduled to land.\n\nThousands of supporters wore the shirts emblazoned with 'God, Guns, Trump'\n\nThey waited in the heat as songs by Abba, Frank Sinatra and Bon Jovi blared on the loudspeakers and cheered as a litany of familiar Trump supporters took turns warming-up the crowd.\n\nRock star Ted Nugent played what was billed as a \"fire-breathing\" rendition of the US national anthem on his electric guitar, interrupted by an obscenity-laced diatribe that included attacks on the \"jack-booted thugs\" in the federal government who he said have been wrongfully imprisoning Trump supporters who stormed the US Capitol on 6 January, 2021.\n\nCongressman Matt Gaetz of Florida and Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia also had their moment on the stage, lobbing pointed attacks on New York City District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who will decide in the days ahead whether to indict Mr Trump.\n\n\"This attack is an egregious weaponisation of our justice system designed to influence the 2024 presidential race,\" Greene said. \"This is nothing but a witch hunt against President Trump, and he is completely innocent.\"\n\nCongresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene had a moment on stage, using it to attack New York City District Attorney Alvin Bragg\n\nThe crowd - which the Trump campaign estimated will reach 15,000 - offered some boos when Mr Bragg's name was mentioned, but few seemed all that concerned by the New York investigation.\n\n\"I don't listen to the negative stuff,\" said Debbie Harvey of Midlothian, Texas, a town near Dallas. \"I'm praying that he doesn't get indicted. God still answers prayers.\"\n\n\"There doesn't seem to be much to it,\" said Brian Novie, who lives in nearby Copperas Cove. \"And now they seem to be struggling with whether prosecute at all.\"\n\nNovie and his friend Richard Tarner, who like Harvey were attending their first Trump rally, bought commemorative t-shirts that read \"Trump in Texas: I was there - where were you?\" They said that, even with what is likely to be a range of choices in the 2024 Republican primaries, they were sticking with Mr Trump.\n\n\"He's proven he can get things done,\" Tarner said, noting that Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, Mr Trump's most formidable rival, had yet to demonstrate that he could perform on the national stage.\n\nIn the run-up to the Waco rally, a number of media outlets and Trump critics had questioned why the former president was holding his first mega-rally of the 2024 campaign in Waco, where 30 years earlier federal and state authorities engaged in an armed standoff with the Branch Davidian religious cult that ended with the death of 86 people.\n\nIt was an incident that helped fuel an anti-government movement in the US, as terms like Nugent's \"jack-booted thugs\" were frequently used to describe federal law officers.\n\nTexas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick told the crowd that such connections were an expletive and \"fake news\".\n\n\"I picked Waco,\" he said. \"The president called me several weeks ago and said: 'I'm coming to Texas. I want you to pick a great town.'\n\nThe former president's plane arrived early evening in the kind of dramatic airfield landing he made a signature of his campaigns in 2016 and 2020. The new \"Trump Force One\" circled the airfield as the song Danger Zone, made popular by the film Top Gun, blared on the loudspeakers. Meanwhile, a speed-artist painted a scowling portrait of the former president on the stage.\n\nThe work turned out to be an accurately foreshadowing of the mood the embattled former president brought to his appearance. While he would eventually tout his record and make promises about a bright future for America if he is elected, it was clear that his legal troubles - and possible impending arrest - were foremost in his mind.", "The ruins of the village have been preserved just as they were after the massacre\n\nAn 88-year-old German man has been charged with involvement in one of the most infamous World War Two massacres.\n\nThe charges relate to Oradour-sur-Glane in central France, where 642 people were murdered by SS troops in 1944.\n\nMany were herded into a local church into which hand grenades were thrown before it was set on fire.\n\nProsecutors in Dortmund said the man had been charged over the murder of 25 people and with aiding and abetting the murder of several hundred.\n\nThe ruins of the village have been preserved just as they were after the massacre, as a permanent memorial.\n\nFrench leader General Charles de Gaulle said it should be a reminder of the cruelty of the Nazi occupation.\n\nSome 60 soldiers were brought to trial in the 1950s.

Almost half the electorate in this deeply polarised country did not back his authoritarian vision of Turkey.\n\nUltimately, Mr Kilicdaroglu was no match for the well-drilled Erdogan campaign, even if he took the president to a run-off second round for the first time since the post was made directly elected in 2014.\n\nBut he barely dented his rival's first-round lead, falling more than two million votes behind.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThe president made the most of his victory, with an initial speech to supporters atop a bus in Turkey's biggest city, Istanbul, followed after dark by a balcony address from his palace to an adoring crowd that he numbered at 320,000 people.\n\n\"It is not just us who won, Turkey won,\" he declared, calling it one of the most important elections in Turkish history.\n\nHe taunted his opponent's defeat with the words \"Bye, bye, Kemal\" - a chant that was also taken up by his supporters in Ankara.\n\nMr Erdogan poured scorn on the main opposition party's increase in its number of MPs in the parliamentary vote two weeks earlier. The true number had fallen to 129, he said, because the party had handed over dozens of seats to its allies.\n\nHe also condemned the opposition alliance's pro-LGBT policies, which he said were in contrast with his own focus on families.\n\nThe run-up to the vote had become increasingly rancorous and in one incident late on Sunday, an opposition Good party official was fatally stabbed in front of a party office in the northern coastal town of Ordu.\n\nThe motive for Erhan Kurt's killing was not clear, but a leading opposition official blamed youths celebrating the election result.\n\nAlthough the final results were not confirmed, the Supreme Election Council said there was no doubt who had won.\n\nIt is highly unusual for the palace complex to be opened to the public - but so was this result, extending his period in power to a quarter of a century.\n\nSupporters came from all over Ankara to taste the victory. There were Islamic chants, while some laid Turkish flags on the grass to pray.\n\nFor a night, Turkey's economic crisis was forgotten. One supporter, Seyhan, said it was all a lie: \"Nobody is hungry. We are very happy with his economy policies. He will do even better in the next five years.\"\n\nBut the president admitted that tackling inflation was Turkey's most urgent issue.\n\nThe question is whether he is prepared to take the necessary measures to do so. At an annual rate of almost 44%, inflation seeps into everyone's lives.\n\nThe cost of food, rent and other everyday goods has soared, exacerbated by Mr Erdogan's refusal to observe orthodox economic policy and raise interest rates.\n\nThe Turkish lira has hit record lows against the dollar and the central bank has struggled to meet surging demand for foreign currency.\n\n\"If they continue with low interest rates, as Erdogan has signalled, the only other option is stricter capital controls,\" warns Selva Demiralp, professor of economics at Koc university in Istanbul.\n\nEconomics was far from the minds of Erdogan supporters, who spoke of their pride at his powerful position in the world and his hard line on fighting \"terrorists\", by which they meant Kurdish militants.\n\nPresident Erdogan has accused his opposite number of siding with terrorists, and criticised him for promising to free a former co-leader of Turkey's second largest opposition party, the pro-Kurdish HDP.\n\nSelahattin Demirtas has been languishing in jail since 2016, despite the European Court of Human Rights ordering his release.\n\nMr Erdogan said while he was in power, Mr Demirtas would stay behind bars.\n\nHe also promised to prioritise rebuilding in areas hit by February's twin earthquakes and bring about the \"voluntary\" return of a million Syrian refugees.\n\nCrowds flocked to Istanbul's Taksim Square, with many coming from the Middle East and the Gulf.\n\nSupporters gathered outside the palace from all over Ankara to hear Mr Erdogan\n\nPalestinians from Jordan wrapped Turkish flags around their shoulders. A Tunisian visitor, Alaa Nassar, said Mr Erdogan had not just made improvements to his own country, \"he is also supporting Arabs and the Muslim world\".\n\nFor all the celebrations, the idea of unity in this polarised country seems farther away than ever.\n\nSince a failed coup in 2016, Mr Erdogan has abolished the post of prime minister and amassed extensive powers, which his opponent had pledged to roll back.\n\nOne voter outside an Ankara polling station on Sunday said he wanted to see an end to the brain drain that began with the post-coup purge.

The computer systems on board - such as the avionics - operate in a very different way to Soviet aircraft.\n\nIn combat, pilots need to instinctively select multiple, correct modes in complex scenarios where they are at risk of being overwhelmed by rapidly developing events - a situation known as task-saturation.\n\nImagine as a car driver switching from a Renault to a Mercedes, and having to instantly know the position of the headlight switches, the wipers and the fog lights - all on a hugely more complicated level. It takes time and practice.\n\nUkrainian pilots will receive training on bespoke simulators. But it is also highly likely they would have been practising on commercially available software, which delivers a very close representation of the workflow required to operate an F-16.\n\nNumbers are also key. It is little use sending half a dozen jets which on their own might be vulnerable to the mighty Su-35s operated by Russia.\n\nCombat aircraft are most effective in packages where jets are grouped together for certain roles - all to carry out one specific mission.\n\nFor example, if the mission is to neutralise an enemy radar installation, you might want a \"four-ship\" comprising four jets to carry the missiles or the bombs to destroy that structure.\n\nThat role is called a Suppression of Enemy Air Defences (SEAD) strike. But you do not want that critical flight itself to be vulnerable to attack.\n\nSo you might have another four aircraft flying ahead in a \"SEAD escort\" role, armed with air-to-air weapons, to protect the SEAD strike from enemy planes.\n\nThe point is all this requires many aircraft, and they need to be supported by other assets.\n\nThat would include surveillance planes to warn about enemy fighters in the area, ground maintenance crews to ensure the upkeep of the jets and having, of course, the necessary infrastructure to take off and land safely.\n\nSo the US decision to give the OK to other nations to supply F-16s marks the start of a complicated process and much work will be required to get to delivery.\n\u2022 None Biden to let allies supply F-16s in boost for Kyiv", "The last of

a \"floating prison\".\n\nCammy Day said the city council had not been consulted on proposals to move asylum seekers onto the MS Victoria.\n\nThe ship has previously housed more than 1,000 Ukrainian refugees, with the last due to leave the ship on 11 July.\n\nThe Home Office said it had a \"statutory obligation to provide accommodation for asylum seekers\".\n\nBut a spokesman added: \"Individuals are not detained and are free to come and go therefore to describe such accommodation as a prison is wrong.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Forth Ports said it had no plans to house an asylum seeker vessel at the Port of Leith.\n\nMr Day said the potential consequences for the city and pressures on services were \"severe\".\n\nHe said the council was \"extremely surprised\" to be contacted by the Home Office about their intentions to commission the ship to house asylum seekers, adding that it was \"all the more surprising given their previous advice that it would be impossible for it to remain\".\n\nMr Day told BBC Scotland the plan was to send 700 single men to the capital, which has already has 4,000 people in temporary accommodation.\n\nHe added that the council had shown solidarity and support for thousands of Ukrainian refugees, along with those from Syria, Afghanistan and Sudan, and remained \"absolutely committed to supporting them in any way we can\".\n\nBut he said asylum seekers needed recognition, rights and support, not an \"unknown future\".\n\nThe council has now agreed to write to the UK government about its decision.\n\n\"We were not consulted on this and urgently require further details from the UK government on their plans,\" Mr Day said.\n\n\"I know the Scottish government and Cosla are in the same position and, having written jointly to the minister of state for immigration, Robert Jenrick MP, we've yet to receive a satisfactory response to our questions and concerns.\"\n\nRefugees first started living on the MS Victoria in July 2022\n\nHe added: \"The potential consequences for the council in terms of the pressures on our services - and the city as a whole - are severe and, barring robust partnership discussions involving NHS, police and other colleagues, we will continue to oppose these plans in the strongest terms.\"\n\nHe said the council believed that Forth Ports was also opposed to the proposals.\n\n\"Many of these people have risked their lives to make it to Europe and what they need is recognition and rights, not an unknown future without the support they so desperately need,\" he added.\n\n\"While the MS Victoria has been a place of refuge for many Ukrainian families arriving in Edinburgh, until we have adequate reassurances from the UK government regarding the welfare and ongoing engagement and support, we cannot allow it to become a floating prison for asylum seekers.\"\n\nForth Ports said it has had no contact from the UK or Scottish government on the matter.\n\nChief executive Charles Hammond said: \"We would not be able to accommodate this facility at the Port of Leith as we continue to create our bespoke offshore renewables hub.\n\n\"We believe that the MS Victoria, which is currently berthed in Leith as a refuge for Ukrainian people, is due to depart in July.\n\n\"Forth Ports has no plans to house an asylum seeker vessel at the Port of Leith.\"\n\nGraham O'Neill, of the Scottish Refugee Council, called on ministers to adopt a \"more sensible and humane\" policy\n\nGraham O'Neill, of the Scottish Refugee Council, said asylum seekers would face \"huge challenges\" if they were moved onto the ship.\n\nHe told BBC Scotland they would not be allowed to work or access social security and would have to exist on \u00a31.30 a day.\n\nMr O'Neill said: \"We think people will be highly isolated, carrying a lot of trauma and seeing no ability to get out of it.\n\n\"It is also important to remember that most people coming to the UK seeking asylum are not only coming from countries like Afghanistan, Sudan and Iran and fleeing very oppressive regimes but they are also stuck in a very long asylum backlog, often for years and years.\"\n\nHe said the figure was currently in the region of 170,000.\n\nMr O'Neill said: \"We anticipate that if people were put onto this ship, like in other ships, barges and ex-hotels across the UK, they are basically being institutionalised.\"\n\nHe also urged UK ministers to implement a \"much more sensible and humane\" policy.\n\nThe Scottish government's migration and refugees minister Emma Roddick said: \"We have made clear to the UK government that vessels are not suitable accommodation for people seeking asylum.\n\n\"Housing asylum seekers in vessels cannot be compared with their use to temporarily accommodate displaced people from Ukraine because of fundamental differences in terms of their rights and agency.\"\n\nShe said that while people were waiting for a decision on their asylum application there were strict restrictions on the right to work and no access to most mainstream benefits.\n\nShe added: \"If the UK government chooses to impose the use of the Ms Victoria to accommodate people in Edinburgh it must provide suitable funding for the council and other local devolved services like health and policing, and ensure services are provided so that people can be supported appropriately.\"\n\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \"The Home Office has a statutory obligation to provide accommodation for asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute while we consider their claim.\n\n\"The significant increase in illegal, unnecessary and dangerous Channel crossings has put our asylum system under incredible strain and made it necessary to continue to use hotels to accommodate some asylum seekers.\n\n\"We are committed to making every effort to reduce hotel use and continue to engage with local authorities as early as possible whenever sites are used

used sanitary towel in an incorrect bin, an official said.\n\nShe made the women strip after attempts to get a confession were unsuccessful.\n\nBrown's says it has suspended the accused manager pending an investigation.\n\nThree people were facing indecent assault charges over the incident, police in Limuru told local media.\n\nIn a video posted to Facebook, Senator Gloria Orwoba said she had received a \"distress call\" about what happened on Monday night.\n\nA manager \"had found a used sanitary towel in one of the bins, and from what I gather, that dustbin was not meant for the disposal of sanitary towels,\" she said.\n\nThe manager initially gathered the women to ask who was responsible, and when she did not receive an answer, she \"needed to find out who was on their period so that she could punish the person that threw the sanitary towel in that bin,\" added Senator Orwoba, who campaigns against period shaming.\n\nShe said that despite her attempts to intervene in the issue, the company was unable to resolve the issue with their employees.\n\nIn a statement on its website, Brown's Food Company said it was \"saddened\" and that the matter \"does not reflect the procedures of the company as a whole\".\n\n\"We are further engaging a women's health expert to help sensitise staff, improve communication, and strengthen our existing policies and procedures,\" the statement read, adding that they are arranging for an independent investigation to take place.\n\nPolice told local media that officers \"conducted a thorough investigation and recorded statements from the victims before arresting three suspects.\"\n\nThey also said similar incidents had taken place in other companies in the area.\n\n\"We have reliably gathered that the demeaning and shaming vice has been going on for a long time. I want to warn any such employers that justice will soon be served to all their victims,\" local police chief Philip Mwania said.\n\nCampaigners say that period shaming is a major problem in Kenya.\n\nIn February, Senator Orwoba was ordered to leave parliament because of an apparent blood stain on her trousers.", "Songmi Park, now 21, is among the most recent North Korean escapees to make it to Seoul\n\nSongmi Park dug her toes into the edge of the riverbank as she prepared to cross.\n\nShe knew she was supposed to be afraid. The river was deep, and the current looked strong. If she was caught she would certainly be punished, perhaps even shot. But she felt a pull far stronger than her fear. She was leaving North Korea to find her mother, who had left her behind as a child.\n\nAs Songmi waded through the icy water at dusk, she felt as if she was flying.\n\nIt was 31 May 2019. \"How can I forget the best and worst day of my life?\" she says.\n\nEscaping North Korea is a dangerous and difficult feat. In recent years Kim Jong Un has clamped down harder on those trying to flee. Then, at the outset of the pandemic, he sealed the country's borders, making Songmi, then 17, one of the last known people to make it out.\n\nThis was the second time Songmi had crossed the Yalu River, which separates North Korea from China, providing escapees with their easiest route out.\n\nThe first time she left she was strapped to her mother's back as a child. Those memories are still as piercing as if they were yesterday .\n\nShe remembers hiding at a relative's pig farm in China, when the state police came looking for them. She remembers her mother and father pleading not to be sent back. \"Send me instead,\" the relative had cried. The police beat him until his face bled.\n\nBack in North Korea, she remembers her father with his hands cuffed behind his back. And she remembers standing on the train station platform, watching both her parents be transported to one of North Korea's infamous prison camps. She was four years old.\n\nSongmi was sent to live with her father's parents on their farm in Musan, a North Korean town half-an-hour from the Chinese border. Going to school was not an option, they told her. Education is free in Communist North Korea, but families are often expected to bribe teachers, and Songmi's grandparents could not afford to.\n\nInstead she spent her childhood roaming the countryside, hunting for clovers to feed the rabbits on the farm. She was often sick, even during summer. \"I didn't eat much and so my immunity was low,\" she says. \"But when I woke up from my sickness my grandmother would always have left me a snack on the windowsill.\"\n\nSongmi with her mother as a toddler\n\nOne evening, five years after the train rolled out of the station bound for the prison camp, her father slipped softly into bed behind her, wrapping her in his arms. She buzzed with excitement. Life could begin again. But three days later, he died. His time in prison had chipped away at his health.\n\nWhen Songmi's mother, Myung-hui, arrived home the following week to find her husband dead, she was distraught. She made an unthinkable decision. She would try to escape North Korea again. Alone.\n\nOn the morning her mother left, Songmi says she could sense something was different. Her mother had dressed strangely, in her grandmother's clothes. \"I didn't know what she was planning but I knew that if she left, I wouldn't see her for a long time,\" she says. As her mother walked out of the house, Songmi curled under her bedsheet and cried.\n\nThe next 10 years were to be her toughest.\n\nWithin two years her grandfather had died. Now she was alone at the age of 10, caring for her bed-ridden grandmother, with no source of income: \"One by one my family were disappearing. It was so scary.\"\n\nIn times of desperation, if you know what to look for, the dense mountains of North Korea can provide meagre sustenance. Every morning Songmi began the two-hour walk up into the mountains, hunting for plants to eat and sell. Certain herbs could be sold as medicine at her local market, but first they needed to be washed, trimmed, and dried by hand, meaning she worked late into the night.\n\n\"I couldn't work or plan for tomorrow. Every day I was trying not to starve, to survive the day.\"\n\nJust 300 miles away, as the crow flies, Myung-hui had arrived in South Korea.\n\nHaving journeyed for a year through China and then into neighbouring Laos, then Thailand, she reached a South Korean embassy.\n\nThe South Korean government, which has an agreement to resettle North Korean escapees, flew her to Seoul. She settled in the industrial town of Ulsan on the south coast. Desperate to earn money that could pay for her daughter's escape, she cleaned the inside of ships at a ship-building factory every day without rest. Escaping from North Korea is expensive. It requires a middleman who can help to navigate the hurdles, and money to bribe anyone who gets in the way.\n\nAt night Myung-hui would sit alone in the dark and think about her daughter, about what she was doing, and what she looked like. Songmi's birthdays were the hardest. She would take a doll from the cupboard and talk to it, pretending it was her daughter, looking for some way to keep their connection alive.\n\nAs Songmi's mother recounts their time apart, from the safety of her kitchen table, she starts to cry. Her daughter strokes her arm. \"Stop crying, all your pretty make-up is getting ruined,\" she says.\n\nAfter paying a broker \u00a317,000 ($20,400), Myung-hui was finally able to arrange her daughter's escape. Suddenly, Songmi's decade of waiting, with dwindling hope, was over.\n\nAfter crossing the Yalu River into China, she kept herself hidden, stealthily moving between locations at night, afraid of being caught once more. She rode a bus over the mountains and into Laos, where she took shelter in a church, before making it to the South Korean embassy. She slept at the embassy for another three months, before being flown to South Korea. When she arrived, she spent months in a resettlement facility, which is typical for North Korean escapees. The whole journey took one year but, to Songmi, it felt like 10.\n\nFinally reunited, she and her mother sit eating bowls of Myung-hui's homemade noodles in a spicy, cold broth.\n\nThe classic North Korean dish is Songmi's favourite. In contrast to her mother's guilt, Songmi radiates an infectious energy. She laughs and jokes as she comforts her mother, concealing any sign of her childhood trauma.\n\n\"The day before I was released from the resettlement centre, I was so nervous. I wasn't sure what I would say to my mother,\" she says. \"I wanted to look pretty in front of her, but I'd gained so much weight during my defection and my hair was a mess.\"\n\n\"I was really nervous too,\" Myung-hui admits.\n\nIn fact Myung-hui didn't recognise her daughter, whom she had last seen when she was eight. Now she was meeting an 18-year-old.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. 'Why did you leave me behind?' Songmi asks her mother\n\n\"Here she was in front of me, so I just accepted this must be her,\" Myung-hui says. \"There was so much I wanted to say, but the words wouldn't come out. I just hugged her and said, 'Well done, you've gone through so much to get here'\".\n\nSongmi says her mind went blank. \"We just cried and hugged for 15 minutes. The whole process felt like a dream\".\n\nAs Songmi and her mother work to build their relationship from scratch, there is one question Songmi has never mustered the courage to ask. It is a question she has asked herself every day since she was eight years old.\n\nNow, as they slurp the remainders of their lunch, she cautiously allows the words to escape.\n\nNervously, Myung-hui starts to explain. Their first escape had been her idea. How could she then return home from prison to live with her in-laws, reminding them every day that she had survived, when their son had died? She had no money, and could not see a way for her and Songmi to survive alone.\n\n\"I wanted to bring you, but the broker said no children,\" she says. \"And, if we got caught again, we would both suffer. So I asked your grandmother to watch you for a year.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Songmi says, her eyes cast down. \"Only one year became 10.\"\n\n\"That morning I left, my feet wouldn't move, but your grandfather hurried me along. He told me to get out. I want you to know, I didn't abandon you. I wanted to provide you with a better life. This seemed like the right choice.\"\n\nThis choice might seem unthinkable to anyone living outside North Korea. But these are the gut-wrenching decisions and risks people must take in order to escape - and it is getting tougher. The government, under the leadership of Kim Jong Un, has increased security along the border and imposed harsher punishments on those who are caught trying to escape.\n\nBefore 2020 more than 1,000 North Koreans would make it to South Korea every year. In 2020, the year Songmi arrived, the number had fallen to 229.\n\nWhen the pandemic broke out early that year, North Korea sealed its borders and banned people from travelling around the country. Soldiers along the border were ordered to shoot and kill anyone they spotted trying to escape. Last year just 67 North Koreans arrived in the South, most of whom had left the North before the pandemic.\n\nSongmi was one of the last to make it out before the borders closed. Her memories are therefore valuable, as they offer a recent and an increasingly rare insight into life inside the world's most secretive state.\n\nShe recalls how the summers were getting hotter. By 2017, the crops started to dry out and die, leaving nothing to eat between autumn and spring. But farmers were still expected to hand over the same crop yield to the government each year, which meant being left with less, sometimes nothing, to eat. They began to forage in the mountains for food. Some eventually chose to give up farming.\n\nThose who worked in the mine, the other main source of employment in her hometown of Musan, fared worse, she says. The international sanctions imposed on North Korea in 2017, after it tested nuclear weapons, meant no-one could buy the mine's iron ore. The mine almost ceased to operate, and workers stopped receiving their wages. They would sneak into the mine at night, she says, to steal parts, which they could flog. They didn't know how to find food in the wild, like those working the land did.\n\nSongmi spent much of her life in North Korea in Musan\n\nBut by 2019, the biggest fear, other than finding enough food to survive was being caught watching foreign films and TV programmes. These have long been smuggled into the North, and provide citizens with a glimpse of the enticing world that exists beyond their borders. Images of glamourous modern-day South Korea, portrayed in K-dramas, pose the biggest threat to the government.\n\n\"Watching a South Korean film would have got you a fine or perhaps sent to a regular prison for two or three years, but by 2019 watching the same movie would get you sent to a political prison camp,\" Songmi says.\n\nShe was found with an Indian film on a USB stick, but managed to convince the security officer that she hadn't known the film was on there, and escaped with a fine. Her friend was not so fortunate. One day, in June 2022, after arriving in South Korea, Songmi received a call from her friend's mother.\n\n\"She told me my friend had been caught with a copy of Squid Game, and because she was the one who had been distributing it, she had been executed,\" Songmi says.\n\nSongmi's account tallies with recent reports from North Korea of people being executed for distributing foreign shows.\n\n\"It seems the situation is even scarier than when I was there. People are being shot or sent to camps for having South Korean media, regardless of their age,\" she says.\n\nAdjusting to life in capitalist, free-wheeling South Korea is often a struggle for North Koreans. It is alienatingly different to anything they have experienced. But Songmi is taking it remarkably in her stride.\n\nShe misses her friends, who she could not tell she was leaving. She misses dancing with them, and the games they used to play with rocks in the dirt.\n\n\"When you meet friends in South Korea you just go shopping or drink coffee,\" she says, a little disparagingly.\n\nWhat has helped Songmi to integrate is her steadfast belief that she is no different to her South Korean peers.\n\n\"After travelling for months through China and Laos, I felt as though I was an orphan, being sent off to live in a foreign country,\" she says. But when she landed at the airport in Seoul the ground staff greeted her with a familiar \"an-nyeong-ha-say-yo\".\n\nThe word for hello, used in both North and South Korea, blew her away: \"I realised we are the same people in the same land. I hadn't come to a different country. I had just travelled south.\"\n\nShe sat in the airport and cried for 10 minutes.\n\nSongmi says she has now found her purpose - to advocate for the two Koreas to be reunited. This is the future that South Koreans are told to dream of, but many do not buy into the dream. The more time passes since the country was divided, the fewer people, particularly the young, see the need for it to come back together.\n\nSongmi visits schools to teach students about the North. She asks who among them has thought about reunification, and typically only a few hands go up. But when she asks them to draw a map of Korea, most sketch the outline of the entire peninsula, including the North and South. This gives her hope.\n\nAs Songmi settles into her relationship with her mother, there are only small glimpses of strain. The pair frequently laugh and hug, and Songmi dries her mother's tears as they explore the painful details of each other's past.\n\nHer mother's choice was the right one, Songmi says, because they are both now living happily in South Korea.\n\nMyung-hui may not have been able to recognise her daughter initially, but the pair look strikingly alike. Now she can see her 19-year-old self in her daughter.\n\nTheir relationship is more like a friendship or one of sisters. Songmi enjoys telling Myung-hui all the details of her dates.\n\nIt is only when they argue that it hits her.\n\n\"Then I'm like, wow, I really am living with my mother,\" she says, laughing.", "Ataf Nabhan was told he had five minutes to evacuate his house - before a missile blew it apart\n\nKamal Nabhan was screaming as he thrust the phone into his cousin's hands, unable to believe what the anonymous caller was telling him.\n\nThe men had just got ready to go to afternoon prayers in Jabalia refugee camp. But the routine patterns of life were about to give way to violent destruction, wrought from above with a warning call.\n\nKamal's cousin Ataf reached out to his relative.\n\n\"I took the phone from him and talked to the person on the line,\" says Ataf. \"He said he was from Israeli intelligence, and you have five minutes to evacuate the house.\"\n\nThey began to rush back, telling the Israeli caller he must be mistaken because the building \"was full\" of disabled people. \"[The intelligence officer] said: 'No, immediately evacuate the house,'\" says Ataf.\n\nIt was day five of the fiercest Israeli air strikes on Gaza in nine months. The campaign of so-called targeted assassinations killed at least six leading figures in Islamic Jihad, the Palestinian territory's second most powerful militant organisation.\n\nBut the attacks also killed 10 civilians on the first night alone - including wives and children of some of the men targeted as they slept. The group retaliated with waves of rocket attacks on Israeli cities, forcing tens of thousands to take cover in bomb shelters.\n\nIsrael said it was acting after repeated rounds of rocket fire by Islamic Jihad, which in turn said it had fired because of police raids against Palestinians at al-Aqsa mosque in occupied east Jerusalem, and the recent death in Israeli jail of hunger striker Khader Adnan.\n\nLast week's fighting killed 33 Palestinians in Gaza and two people in Israel - an Israeli and a Palestinian. It left more than 1,200 Palestinians displaced, according to the UN.\n\nAt the Nabhan family's building, Israel delivered on its warning. A single missile blew the block apart.\n\nThe blast blew the Nabhan family's home apart\n\nJust before a ceasefire deal was agreed late on Saturday, Israel destroyed several other residential blocks in similar circumstances - giving warnings to evacuate residents before bombing the buildings. These strikes that bring down whole apartment blocks are a well-worn tactic in its attacks on Gaza.\n\nIsrael says the buildings it hit were used as \"command and control centres\" by Islamic Jihad to direct rocket launches. It said its warning calls were meant to prevent harm to uninvolved civilians.\n\nLocal sources believe a militant lived in the building but not that it was an operational centre. Human rights groups condemn such attacks destroying entire residential blocks as a violation of international law. Another resident who received a warning call was filmed pleading with Israeli forces to limit any attack \"to the apartment of the guilty\".\n\nThe building in Jabalia has collapsed into its own foundations. An entire staircase that provided the escape route for several families lies horizontally, jutting into a smashed wall section. The remains of the roof are a few metres above the earth, providing the only shade for the former residents. Neighbours managed to get everyone out - nearly 50 people from eight families.\n\nThere were five people in the building with disabilities including muscular dystrophy, say support groups. Some had wheelchairs, specially modified beds and medicines destroyed in the air strike, they add.\n\nJamal al-Rozzi, executive director of the Gaza-based Society for Rehabilitation, who came to help the families, says his group will provide aid including food and medical devices.\n\n\"I feel angry and I feel pain because this should not happen, at least not for the civilians, especially not disabled people,\" he says.\n\nAlso sheltering among the rubble is another of Kamal Nabhan's relatives. Rahma Nabhan and her husband Yasser are sitting under a fractured roof slab, passing their baby daughter Jori to each other to soothe her cries.\n\nRahma Nabhan and her family are now sleeping outside their destroyed home\n\n\"My sisters-in-law are disabled - they were not able even to cover their heads [when they were rescued], their wheelchairs were buried under the house,\" says Rahma.\n\n\"Everyone saw the disabled people fleeing. They were asking: 'Why did the house have to be destroyed? Have these disabled people fired rockets?' We have nothing to do with what's going on,\" she says.\n\nRahma walks me around the remnants, still clutching Jori as we navigate the rubble.\n\nHer flat was on the top floor. Now there are only cardboard signs the residents have hoisted over the concrete remains, showing the names of each former inhabitant.\n\n\"We are not going anywhere, we will stay in the sun, sleep in the sun, we are not leaving the house,\" says Rahma.\n\n\"We call on the international organisations and [Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas] to stand with us and rebuild this house because we have no place to go,\" she says.\n\nThe ceasefire reached on Saturday night, mediated by Egypt, has largely held. But tensions remain extremely high, after months of spiralling violence in the occupied West Bank which has spilt over into Gaza on three major occasions since an all-out war between Israel and Hamas in May 2021.\n\nLast week's attacks have left Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu politically emboldened. They could easily have ignited a far bigger confrontation - in fact they still could despite the truce. But he has used the fighting to burnish his reputation for security in the face of unprecedented domestic unrest and growing pressure from religious-ultranationalist extremists in his coalition.\n\nDespite its losses, Islamic Jihad has used the escalation to promote its appeal as the current face of armed resistance against Israel while Hamas - the dominant militant group in Gaza - stayed on the sidelines in terms of military action.\n\nIt publicly backed the rocket fire as part of a \"unified\" position by Palestinian factions but effectively restrained itself, thereby limiting the round of fighting. It also has to keep services running for Gaza's population under a crippling Israeli-Egyptian blockade. A larger war could swing popular opinion further against it.\n\nSince 2021, the Israeli government has given permits to thousands of workers to cross into Israel, boosting Gaza's economy and bolstering tax revenues for Hamas. However, the group has warned against annual plans for an ultranationalist Israeli flag march through Muslim areas of occupied east Jerusalem on Thursday, keeping tensions boiling.\n\nBoth Hamas and Islamic Jihad are listed by Israel and the West as terrorist organisations.\n\nHowever, many Palestinians here feel abandoned by an international community that still talks about a political future for the region - a two-state solution - which is outright rejected by both Israel's nationalist government and the Palestinian armed groups.\n\nAt the Nabhans' house, neighbours and other Gaza-based charities arrive for a gathering in solidarity with the residents. It comes on the same day Palestinians mark the 75th anniversary of the Nakba, when 700,000 people fled or were forced from their homes in the conflicts surrounding Israel's creation.\n\nThe homeless residents hold up signs saying \"Protect us\" and \"We call for help\".\n\nAtaf Nabhan, who took the warning call from the Israeli intelligence officer, gestures to the rubble and tells me his plea is simple.\n\n\"This family needs a shelter,\" he says. \"We just ask the human rights organisations - take care of this family.\"", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

How the Royal children enjoyed the Coronation\n\nThe prospect of a two-hour church service, full of ceremony and importance, is a daunting prospect for most, let alone if you've just turned five.\n\nBut luckily for Prince Louis, the youngest royal at the Coronation had his sister Princess Charlotte to hold his hand, physically and metaphorically.\n\nTheir older brother Prince George had a formal part to play as one of their grandfather King Charles' pages of honour.\n\nBut Louis and Charlotte ended up taking a starring role too thanks to their antics during the day.\n\nThey arrived with their parents the Prince and Princess of Wales, with Charlotte in a matching Alexander McQueen outfit to her mother, down to a miniature version of Catherine's silver leaf headdress.\n\nLouis, meanwhile, wore a dark blue tunic by Savile Row tailors Dege and Skinner.\n\nPerhaps offering reassurance, or making sure he went the right way, eight-year-old Charlotte held Louis' hand as they processed through the abbey behind their parents.\n\nOnce the Coronation proper started, they took their front row seats alongside their parents. The solemn, religious ceremony elicited a yawn or two from the young prince - and he could also at times be seen pointing things out to Charlotte from their seats near the high altar.\n\nHis age is no doubt why a break was arranged, with viewers noticing Louis had disappeared from his seat, returning in time to sing God Save the King.\n\nHe had not attended the last major royal event, the funeral of his great-grandmother Queen Elizabeth II in September, when he was just four, as he was felt to be too young.\n\nThe siblings followed along with the order of service during the Coronation\n\nBut that wasn't enough to stop Louis from yawning during the two-hour event\n\nAfter the King was crowned and the formal part of the day was over, the Wales family met up with Prince George as he completed his duties.\n\nThey took their places in the royal procession to Buckingham Palace, in the first carriage behind the Gold State Coach.\n\nLouis pressed his face close to the glass on one side of the bench, sat opposite his parents, as he waved at the waiting crowds.\n\nLouis gave the crowds a smile and a wave as they made their way to Buckingham Palace\n\nLouis made headlines himself at last summer's Jubilee celebrations when he was seen pulling faces on the Buckingham Palace balcony and appearing to scream when the flypast went overhead.\n\nAnyone hoping for similar scenes after the Coronation would not have been disappointed.\n\nHe drummed his fingers on the balcony railing at one point, and showed his own version of the royal wave.\n\nThe two-handed wave, not dissimilar to the motion of windscreen wipers, was perhaps apt for a rainy day.\n\nThe children were seen pointing at the sky during the flypast before returning inside the palace after their long day.", "Poultry and captive birds can be kept outside again starting next week as the risk from bird flu eases, the government said on Tuesday.\n\nThe Chief Veterinary Officer said the \"mandatory housing order\" for England and Wales would lift at 00:01 on Tuesday, April 18.\n\nThe measures were introduced during the world's biggest ever bird flu outbreak.\n\nThe UK has seen more than 330 cases confirmed and 4 million birds culled over the past year.\n\nThe decision means that eggs laid by hens with access to outdoor areas can be marketed as \"free-range\" again.\n\nThe UK's Chief Veterinary Officer, Dr Christine Middlemiss, still warned that \"scrupulous standards\" of biosecurity will need to be maintained as avian flu is expected to still be circulating in the environment for several weeks.\n\nMs Middlemiss said: \"Whilst the lifting of the mandatory housing measures will be welcome news... the unprecedented nature of this outbreak has proved it's more important than ever for bird keepers to remain vigilant.\"\n\nFigures released to the BBC showed that 208 million birds around the world have died from this latest outbreak and there have been 200 recorded cases of the flu spilling over into mammals.\n\nBut the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has said that the risk to the public is very low.\n\nThe British Free Range Egg Producers Association (Bfrepa) chief executive Robert Gooch said: \"Free-range egg producers will be relieved to see their hens outside again.\n\n\"While on the range, hens like to scratch, dust bathe and forage for additional food, displaying the natural behaviours that consumers associated with free-range and organic egg production.\"\n\nBirds in Northern Ireland remain under lockdown but in Scotland the housing order was never implemented after the country's chief vet said the evidence did not justify such a move.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "We are now back in court, but Lucy Letby is in the dock, rather than being in the witness box.

I've never told anybody to hack a phone.\"\n\nThe long-awaited case involves allegations that the publisher of the Mirror illegally gathered information about the Duke of Sussex and a number of other celebrities to generate stories.\n\nIn written arguments put before the court, the barrister representing Prince Harry said it was \"inconceivable\" that Mr Morgan and other editors did not know about MGN journalists instructing private investigators to obtain information.\n\nMr Morgan has always denied any knowledge of phone hacking or illegal activity at the Daily Mirror when he was editor.\n\nHe was editor of the Daily Mirror from 1995 to 2004\n\nHe was interviewed by the BBC's Amol Rajan before the trial began. In it, Mr Morgan said he thought phone hacking - the interception of mobile phone voicemail messages - was completely wrong.\n\nHe added it \"shouldn't have been happening\" and said it was \"lazy journalists being lazy\". He said there was no evidence that he knew anything about it.\n\nAsked in the interview whether it stretched credulity that, as a hands-on editor, he didn't know what was going on, Mr Morgan replied: \"I didn't. So I don't care whether it stretches people's credulity, or not.\"\n\nThe former editor pointed out that although there were civil cases happening, none of the journalists who worked with him at the Daily Mirror have been arrested in connection with phone hacking.\n\nMr Morgan worked at the Daily Mirror for nearly a decade, but he said none of the civil cases had anything to do with him.\n\n\"I've not been called to give evidence, I know nothing about it,\" he told BBC News.

I mean, nobody wrote the way he did.\"\n\nSamuel L Jackson (left) and Tommy Lee Jones (right) starred in 2011's The Sunset Limited, written by McCarthy\n\nMany of his novels were violent tales describing the American frontier and post-apocalyptic worlds. In real life, he was said to be a very private man.\n\nBanville noted his fellow writer did have \"a very bleak view of life\".\n\n\"You did not have many laughs with Cormac,\" he said. \"He didn't see the world as a particularly comic place, which I do. But we got on well. I liked him enormously.\"\n\nIn his tribute, King added: \"He was full of years and created a fine body of work - but I still mourn his passing.\"\n\nMcCarthy had died of natural causes, at his home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, on Tuesday, Penguin Random House said.\n\nThe publisher's chief executive, Nihar Malaviya, said McCarthy had \"changed the course of literature\".\n\n\"For 60 years he demonstrated an unwavering dedication to his craft and to exploring the infinite possibilities and power of the written word,\" Mr Malaviya said.\n\n\"Millions of readers around the world embraced his characters, his mythic themes and the intimate emotional truths he laid bare on every page in brilliant novels that will remain both timely and timeless for generations to come.\"\n\nHis UK publisher, Picador, described McCarthy as \"one of the world's most influential and renowned writers\".\n\nThe company's boss, Mary Mount, hailed his \"extraordinary body of work\", saying he was \"a writer of great vision and great beauty\".\n\nHis greatest books included The Road, McCarthy's 10th novel, which was published in 2006 and won the prestigious Pulitzer Prize for fiction the following year. It describes a father and son's arduous journey as they struggle to survive in the US after the apocalypse.\n\nHis 2005 novel, No Country for Old Men, a grim story of a drug deal gone wrong in the Texas desert, was adapted for the screen by Joel and Ethan Coen.\n\nStarring Javier Bardem and Tommy Lee Jones, the thriller went on to win four Oscars, including best picture.\n\nThere have been a string of attempts to adapt Blood Meridian for the cinema. In April, Deadline reported The Road director John Hillcoat would become the latest to tackle it.\n\nMcCarthy's \"career spanned nearly six decades and several genres, including fiction and drama\", publisher Pan Macmillan said in its tribute\n\nBorn in Providence, Rhode Island, in 1933, in an Irish Catholic family, McCarthy was one of six siblings.\n\nHe spent most of his childhood in Knoxville, Tennessee, where his father worked as a lawyer. His first novel, The Orchard Keeper, was published in 1965.\n\nMcCarthy's last two books - The Passenger and Stella Maris - were published at the end of last year. As well as his novels, he also wrote screenplays and short stories.\n\nDuring his long career, his media interviews or appearances on the red carpet were a rarity.\n\nIn 2007, McCarthy told US talk-show host Oprah Winfrey: \"I don't think [interviews] are good for your head.\n\n\"If you spend a lot of time thinking about how to write a book, you probably shouldn't be thinking about it, you probably should be doing it.\"\n\u2022 None The chaos and carnage in Cormac McCarthy's novels", "Last updated on .From the section Horse Racing\n\nPolice arrested 118 people over disruption to the Grand National that saw animal rights activists delay the start of the race by getting on to the course at Aintree.\n\nMerseyside Police held nine people who had managed to enter the track.\n\nThey later said there had been a total of 118 arrests for both \"criminal damage and public nuisance offences\".\n\nThat includes arrests before the race on Saturday and in relation to a protest that blocked the M57.\n\nThe race started 14 minutes late after its scheduled start time of 17:15 BST.\n\nThe 175th edition was won by Corach Rambler, ridden by Derek Fox.\n\nOne horse, Hill Sixteen, died after falling at the first fence, meaning there have been three horse deaths at the 2023 meeting overall.\n\n\"Just after 5pm a large number of protesters attempted to gain entry on to the course,\" Merseyside Police said.\n\n\"The majority were prevented from breaching the boundary fencing but the nine individuals who managed to enter the course were later arrested by officers.\"\n\nTelevision pictures appeared to show some protesters making it on to the track and trying to attach themselves to a fence, before being removed by police.\n\nDozens of others attempted to climb over or glue themselves to security fencing around the track but were led away, with police also confiscating ladders.\n\nClimate and animal rights group Animal Rising, who earlier demonstrated outside Aintree, claimed on social media their supporters entered the track to delay the race.\n\nTraffic was also blocked by protesters on the M57 motorway shortly before activists entered the track at Aintree.\n\nNorth West Motorway Police said there was \"a number of people sat on the M57\" at junction two northbound, and traffic was stopped in both directions. The road fully reopened shortly after 20:00.\n\nMerseyside Police Assistant Chief Constable Paul White said: \"Today, as you've seen, there's been a significant protest in relation to the running of the Grand National.\n\n\"This began earlier this morning. There's been a number of protests outside and then that resulted earlier on today at about 5pm with numerous people trying to incur onto the course, which we, in partnership with the event organisers, and members of the public as well, have managed in the main to stop and and ultimately the event took place - albeit with a slight delay.\"\n\nMr White said it required \"significant resource\" to cover the perimeter of Aintree, with protesters attempting to access the course from a number of points around the track.\n\nHe said police had a \"proportionate\" plan in place and were able to stop \"the vast majority\" from entering the course, and those who did were removed \"swiftly\".\n\nMr White added: \"We've had to uplift our resources significantly. Clearly we were very much aware there was a planned protest today.\n\n\"We always have a proportionate policing plan in place to manage the event and support event organisers, but because of the additional information and intelligence regarding protests we had to increase resources significantly for today.\"\n\nAfter the delay was announced on the racecourse public address system, the 39 participating horses were taken back to the pre-parade ring.\n\nThe jockeys were asked to re-mount their rides six minutes after the scheduled start time, with the race starting eight minutes later.\n\nDickon White, who runs the track as North West regional director for the Jockey Club, said the delay was caused by the \"reckless actions of a small number of individuals\".\n\nMerseyside Police thanked the public for their \"patience\" while they dealt with the protests.\n\nThe police had previously said they would deal \"robustly\" with any disruption after animal rights activists threatened to sabotage the race.\n\nAintree Racecourse warned that the actions of protestors could \"endanger the horses they purport to protect, as well as jockeys, officials and themselves\".\n\nSpeaking before protesters entered the track, Animal Rising spokesperson Nathan McGovern said: \"Police are wasting time chasing protesters rather than addressing the climate and ecological emergency, and our broken relationship to animals.\n\n\"We remain undeterred, and we will peacefully continue our actions to stop harm coming to animals at Aintree.\n\n\"Today marks the first of many actions that will really take place this summer to push this conversation to the top of the agenda.\"\n\nAnimal Rising posted photos on social media appearing to show supporters slow-marching around Aintree on Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe total of 118 arrests includes three people who were earlier held in connection with potential co-ordinated disruption activities.\n\nA 25-year-old woman from London and a man were arrested outside Aintree on suspicion of conspiracy to cause public nuisance.\n\nA 33-year-old woman from the London area was arrested in Greater Manchester on suspicion of the same offence.\n\nAnimal Rising claimed one of those arrested earlier on Saturday was one of its members, 25-year-old Claudia Penna Rojas.\n\nAs well as the death of Hill Sixteen, Dark Raven was put down earlier on Saturday following a fall during the Turners Mersey Novices' Hurdle at Aintree, while Envoye Special suffered a fatal injury in the Foxhunters' Chase on Thursday.\n\nTwo other horses in the Grand National - Recite A Prayer and Cape Gentleman - were treated on course and taken away by horse ambulance for further assessment.\n\nThere have been five fatalities from 395 runners in the 10 Grand Nationals raced since safety changes were introduced in 2012.\n\nBookmakers expected more than \u00a3150m to be wagered on the National, which takes place over 30 fences and four and a quarter miles.", "Belgorod regional chief Vyacheslav Gladkov posted a video saying he had agreed to an offer to meet the fighters\n\nFighters opposed to the government in Moscow say they have captured some Russian soldiers in Belgorod, near the border with Ukraine.\n\nBelgorod's top official replied to say he had agreed to meet the men's captors if the soldiers were still alive.\n\nBut later, the fighters said that the governor \"had not found the courage\" to meet them and they would hand over their captives to Ukraine.\n\nRussia has blamed Ukraine for recent attacks in its border territories.\n\nThe Russian army said on Sunday its artillery had hit a \"terrorist\" group near the village of Novaya Tavolzhanka, adding that \"the enemy scattered and retreated\".\n\nEarlier, a group of paramilitaries issued a message on the Telegram app, saying they had captured two men but would hand them over if Belgorod governor Vyacheslav Gladkov agreed to talks.\n\nThe video purported to show both captives, although the BBC has been unable to independently verify their identities.\n\nThe message was posted by the Liberty of Russia Legion (FRL) and described as a joint statement with the Russian Volunteer Corps (RDK).\n\nMr Gladkov responded with his own Telegram video, saying he had agreed to the talks if the soldiers were shown to be still alive - adding that he thought they had probably been killed.\n\nLater, the RDK posted a further video - this time appearing to show even more captives, in which they said that Mr Gladkov had failed to turn up for the meeting.\n\n\"Neither the military nor the civilian leadership is interested\" in the fate of the captured men, the RDK said.\n\nMeanwhile, the FRL described the Russian authorities as \"rotten and cowardly\". They said they would now hand over the captives to Ukraine - to be subject to an exchange with Ukrainian prisoners of war.\n\nBoth groups want to topple President Vladimir Putin, and also oppose the full-scale invasion of Ukraine that he launched in February last year.\n\nUkrainian officials say the two paramilitary organisations consist of Russian citizens who want to create a \"security zone\" for Ukrainians.\n\nThe RDK came to prominence in March for a cross-border raid in Russia's Bryansk region. Its leader is a Russian nationalist with alleged links to neo-Nazis.\n\nThe FRL is considered a different sort of organisation that fights alongside Ukrainian troops against Russian forces.\n\nThe Russian Volunteer Corps (RDK) came to prominence in the Bryansk region in March\n\nIn his video, Mr Gladkov labelled the fighters in question \"scoundrels, murderers, fascists\", but promised to \"guarantee safety\" if the talks took place.\n\nAnd though they asked him to go to Novaya Tavolzhanka to meet them, he said this was too dangerous and that he would expect them at a checkpoint in the town of Shebekino.\n\nMr Gladkov has not commented on the events since the video, but posted pictures of a meeting with regional and federal officials.\n\nKyiv has denied having any direct involvement in such attacks.\n\nBut it has painted the growing violence in Russian territory as being the inevitable consequence of Russia's invasion last year.", "Companies linked to Roman Abramovich, Said Gutseriev and Oleg Deripaska have yet to comply with the new law\n\nThe UK has so far failed to impose fines worth as much as \u00a31bn on foreign companies breaking a landmark transparency law, BBC analysis reveals.\n\nSince January, overseas firms that own UK property can be fined up to \u00a32,500 a day unless they declare their owners.\n\nThousands are still to do so, including firms which have been linked to oligarchs such as Roman Abramovich, but no fines have yet been issued.\n\nThe government said it was \"building cases\" against unregistered companies.\n\nThe register was introduced as part of the Economic Crime Act in February 2022, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Ministers said it would reveal who ultimately owned UK property and also stop foreign criminals using UK property to launder money.\n\n\u200b\u200bAlthough the majority of companies have submitted their details, about 5,000 firms with property in England and Wales have not, more than three months after the 31 January deadline.

Colum Eastwood says the SDLP is \"here to stay\" despite last year's \"bruising\" election\n\nThe Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader has dismissed political \"naysayers\" and insisted his party is \"here to stay\".\n\nAddressing his party's annual conference, Colum Eastwood acknowledged the party had been through a \"bruising electoral contest\" last May.\n\nHe told SDLP members in Londonderry that \"the adversity we face now is nothing compared to the adversity this party has shouldered in the past\".\n\n\"We are a party that is ready to get back to work and we will win again,\" he said.\n\nThe SDLP leader and MP for Foyle said last year's assembly election had \"exacted a high price\".\n\nHe told members that those who had written off the party before should be ignored.\n\n\"The people in this hall today, and the many friends and colleagues outside, the values they represent and the vision we set for this island can never be written off,\" he added.\n\n\"We're going to embark on a long-term political strategy with the goal of reimagining our country,\" Mr Eastwood said, acknowledging his party's commission for a new Ireland, which he said was \"shifting gear\".\n\n\"This is when we are at our best - when we bring together an unstoppable coalition.\"\n\nHe also called for an end to the \"poisonous politics of veto\" at Stormont and accused the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) of being \"wreckers\" of the institutions.\n\n\"The DUP need to get back to work or get out of the way,\" Mr Eastwood said.\n\nHe added sharing power was the \"engine\" of Stormont and not an \"optional extra\".\n\nThe DUP has boycotted devolved government at Stormont over Northern Ireland Protocol concerns\n\nThe party's conference came days after MPs including those in the SDLP voted to back the Windsor Framework agreed by the UK and EU.\n\nThe framework is designed to make trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK easier.\n\nIt gives the Stormont assembly more say over EU rules and has been welcomed by most Northern Ireland parties.\n\nMr Eastwood said the DUP, which voted against the deal, was \"digging its heels in\".\n\nAnd he added that if the party held out on returning to power sharing at Stormont, the \"only alternative\" would be a new settlement between London and Dublin.\n\n\"If we are unable to secure lasting reform of the institutions then the only alternative is a new settlement that retains power with the Irish and British traditions that share this island.\n\n\"And if political parties will not work together, then there must be a new model of shared stewardship between the British and Irish governments.\"\n\nHe told SDLP members that the choice facing the DUP is not about the Northern Ireland Protocol or framework, but whether they \"can share power with their neighbours\".\n\nIt makes sense that the SDLP would choose its heartland of Foyle to bring its members together.\n\nThere is no shying away from how hard a time the party has had recently.\n\nIt lost four seats last year in May's assembly election and recent polls haven't proved any more positive.\n\nThat said, the party's south Belfast MP Claire Hanna has said that since then, the SDLP has been doing some serious thinking and reflection.\n\nIn other words: they may be down but they're not out, if Colum Eastwood can help it.\n\nHe believes in the message he's selling but it's not the audience in Derry he needs to persuade.\n\nThe next electoral test for the SDLP is just eight weeks away.", "A decision to quash a Department of Health policy on paying for care costs in nursing homes has been welcomed by the NI commissioner for older people.\n\nThe commissioner, Eddie Lynch, was reacting to a decision by High Court judge Mr Justice Scoffield.\n\nThe judge ruled the department failed to properly consider the impact on elderly people who could potentially lose life savings to meet health costs.\n\nHe said it had been responsible for a \"plain dereliction in its duty\".\n\nThe commissioner, Mr Lynch, took a judicial review on behalf of Robin McMinnis.\n\nThe 75-year-old, who is quadriplegic and has complex medical needs, has been paying for his care while living in a Belfast nursing home.\n\nThe Continuing Healthcare Policy relates to the assessment of whether a person's needs can be met in a hospital which will not cost anything or is social-care related which could incur costs.\n\nThe judicial review highlighted that the criteria and threshold for when a person should pay for their care is unclear and operates differently between each health trust.\n\nEddie Lynch said the High Court ruling was a win for older people\n\nAll older people with assets worth more than \u00a323,250 have to pay for their social care.\n\nA change to the policy, introduced in February 2021, uses a single criteria question where people are asked: \"Can your care needs be met properly in any other setting other than a hospital?\"\n\nThose people who are placed in a nursing home have to pay, while others who say they cannot go to a nursing home instead have their care paid for while in hospital.\n\nThe judge ruled that Mr McMinnis was unfairly refused the funding and ordered the Belfast Trust to reconsider his application.\n\nHe said he also proposed \"to quash the decision of the department to adopt the 2021 policy\".\n\nMr McMinnis said it had been \"a long journey for me personally over the past six years with many setbacks\".\n\n\"It has been a matter of principle for me, knowing that many others have been disqualified or were unaware of the Continuing Healthcare Policy,\" he continued.\n\nReacting to the judgement, Mr Lynch said he was delighted for Mr McMinnis.\n\n\"This is also a win for the many older people who have contacted my office over the past number of years in relation to issues with continuing healthcare assessments, all of whom will now be entitled to receive the fair assessment they deserve,\" he said.\n\nOn Tuesday he told BBC's Good Morning Ulster the ruling shows the system \"was not fit for purpose\".\n\n\"The bottom line here was older people were being failed by the system,\" the commissioner said.\n\n\"Older people whose costs should have been picked up by the NHS were paying for their care.\n\n\"People were left high and dry, people who were entitled to this [financial] support because the system was not set up properly to give them a fair assessment.\"\n\nHe said this ruling \"overturns and quashes a policy that was ageist\".\n\nMr Lynch said now that the policy has been quashed, the onus is on the Department of Health to \"come up with a policy that treats people fairly\".\n\nThe department said it \"will be considering the judgement, before deciding on next steps\".", "We are now back in court, but Lucy Letby is in the dock, rather than being in the witness box.

The fact that Alun Titford chose to absent himself from the care of Kaylea, does not give him an excuse.\"\n\nKaylea was subjected to \"shocking and prolonged\" neglect at the hands of her parents\n\nIn mitigation for Lloyd-Jones, Lewis Power KC said his client had an \"epiphany of insight into her actions\", leading to her guilty plea.\n\n\"She accepts that she owed her daughter a duty of care, and that she did breach that duty by failing to take reasonable care for her daughter's health and welfare needs.\"\n\nMr Power said that, prior to the pandemic, Lloyd-Jones was \"a lady who tried her best\", and added that she suffered from depression and became \"gradually overwhelmed\", particularly due to the \"pressures of lockdown\".\n\nDavid Elias KC, representing Titford, said his client showed \"genuine remorse\" and that the pair had been \"good parents\" up until the lockdown period.\n\nHe said that Titford suffered from depression and a historic drug addiction, \"lacked confidence\" and was \"overly reliant\" on others.\n\nHowever, the judge said he \"did not accept\" that outside agencies should have been more proactive.\n\n\"They never asked for help they didn't get.

The BBC cannot verify this claim.\n\n\"The partial evacuation they announced is going too fast, and there is a possibility that they may be preparing for provocations and (for that reason) focusing on civilians,\" Mr Fedorov added.", "The head of Russia's Wagner mercenary group has announced that its forces have started withdrawing from the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut.\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin has vowed to transfer control of the city to the Russian army by 1 June, but Kyiv says it still controls pockets of the city.\n\nHe said his forces were ready to return if the Russian regular army proved unable to manage the situation.\n\nThe battle for the city has been the longest and bloodiest of the war.\n\nWagner mercenaries have led the fighting there for the Russian side, and Mr Prigozhin this week said that 20,000 of its fighters had died in Bakhmut.\n\n\"We are withdrawing units from Bakhmut today,\" Mr Prigozhin said in a video released on Telegram from the destroyed city.\n\nBBC Verify has geolocated the video to an area near a pharmacy in the east of Bakhmut.\n\nMr Prigozhin - who announced the capture of the city on Saturday - is seen telling his men to leave ammunition for the Russian army. He adds that some Wagner fighters will stay behind to assist Russian troops.\n\n\"The moment when the military are in a tough situation, they will stand up,\" he says, before warning two fighters to not \"bully the military\".\n\nThe Wagner boss has repeatedly targeted top Russian military officials, criticising them publicly for not supporting his troops. Last month, he even threatened to pull his troops out of the city if they were not provided with much-needed ammunition.\n\nDespite Wagner's claims to be handing over Bakhmut, Ukraine has not conceded that the city has fallen.\n\nUkraine's Deputy Defence Minister, Hanna Maliar, said on Thursday that its forces still control part of the Litak district in the southwest of the city.\n\n\"The enemy has replaced Wagner units in the suburbs with regular army troops. Inside the town proper, Wagner forces are still present,\" she posted on Telegram.\n\nAnalysts say Bakhmut is of little strategic value to Moscow, but its capture would be a symbolic victory for Russia after the longest battle of the war in Ukraine so far.\n\nWagner mercenaries have concentrated their efforts on the city for months and their relentless, costly tactic of sending in waves of men seems to have gradually eroded Kyiv's resistance.\n\nMr Prigozhin has emerged as a key player in Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine launched in February 2022, in charge of the private army of mercenaries.\n\nHe recruited thousands of convicted criminals from jail for his group - no matter how grave their crimes - as long as they agreed to fight for Wagner in Ukraine.\n\nAround half of the 20,000 Wagner fighters to have died in Bakhmut were convicts, Mr Prigozhin said this week.\n\nEarlier this month, the US said it believed more than 20,000 Russian soldiers had been killed in the battle for Bakhmut and another 80,000 wounded. The BBC is unable to independently verify the figures.\n\nUkraine has not released figures on its casualties in Bakhmut, but has also sustained heavy losses.\n\nThe capture of Bakhmut would bring Russia slightly closer to its goal of controlling the whole of Donetsk region, one of four regions in eastern and southern Ukraine annexed by Russia last September following referendums widely condemned outside Russia as a sham.\n\nHowever, when Russia fought fiercely to claim the cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk last summer, Ukraine soon reclaimed swathes of territory elsewhere.\n\nThere were about 70,000 people living in Bakhmut before the invasion, but only a few thousand remain in the devastated city, once best known for its salt and gypsum mines and huge winery.", "Kemi Badenoch discussed the upcoming gender guidance for schools on Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg\n\nParents should be aware of what is happening with their child, the equalities minister has said ahead of gender guidance for England schools.\n\nKemi Badenoch told the BBC she \"can't go into specifics\" of what will be in the new guidance, expected next week.\n\nRecent reports have suggested schools will be told to tell parents if students are questioning their gender.\n\nMs Badenoch said \"what is right is that parents know what is going on with their children at school\".\n\nShe told the BBC's Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg that the guidance would bring \"clarity\" for schools on \"how to deal with children experiencing gender distress\".\n\nShe added: \"There's quite a lot of confusion about what the law says and it is important that parents are aware of what's going on with their children and what's happening to them at school, so what we're doing is making sure we have robust guidance that's going to be able to stand up to scrutiny.

The government says it will appeal.\n\nLabour says the plan is \"unethical\" and Ms Braverman is \"ramping up rhetoric\".\n\nAsylum Aid, the charity which brought the legal challenge, said the decision taken by the court on Thursday was a \"vindication of the importance of the rule of law and basic fairness\".\n\nThe plan to send people who arrive in the UK illegally to Rwanda was first unveiled in April 2022 in an attempt to deter crossings on the English Channel on small boats.\n\nIt has been subject to several legal challenges, including the latest at the Court of Appeal where judges ruled that Rwanda had not provided enough safeguards to prove it is a \"safe third country\".\n\nTwo out of the three judges found that there was a risk that asylum seekers sent to Rwanda could then be forced back to the country from where they were originally fleeing. This means the UK government's immigration policy contravenes the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects against torture.\n\nHowever Ms Braverman said this did not mean that Rwanda itself was not safe.\n\nThe home secretary told MPs she respected the judgement, but added it was \"disappointing\" and that the government would be challenging it.\n\nMs Braverman said that the \"abuse\" of the asylum system was \"unfair\" on local communities, taxpayers and \"those who play by the rules\".\n\nShe added that it \"incentivises mass flows of economic migration into Europe, lining the pockets of people smugglers and turning our seas into graveyards, all in the name of a phoney humanitarianism\".\n\nShadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the government's Rwanda scheme was \"completely unravelling\" and described it as \"unworkable, unethical and extortionately expensive.\"\n\n\"This is their chaos, their Tory chaos, their boats chaos and their broken asylum system,\" she said.\n\nShe also accused the home secretary of \"wasting everybody's time\" on \"ramping up the rhetoric rather than coming up with a serious plan\".\n\nThe Rwandan government insisted it was \"one of the safest countries in the world\" and had been recognised for its \"exemplary treatment of refugees\".\n\nThe case was brought by Asylum Aid, which argued the policy was unlawful, as well as 10 people from countries including Syria, Iraq and Albania, who arrived in the UK in small boats.\n\nThe High Court had backed the government's policy at an earlier hearing, but that decision was scrutinised by Appeal Court judges Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett, Sir Geoffrey Vos and Lord Justice Underhill in this latest stage of the process.\n\nWhile Lord Burnett sided with the UK government, the others concluded that the assurances from the Rwandan government were not \"sufficient to ensure that there is no real risk that asylum seekers relocated under the Rwanda policy will be wrongly returned to countries where they face persecution or other inhumane treatment\".\n\nThey said that sending asylum seekers to Rwanda will be unlawful \"unless and until the deficiencies in [its government's] asylum processes are corrected\".\n\nThe judges stressed that they all agreed that the Rwandan government's assurances of the policy had been made \"in good faith\".\n\nTessa Gregory, a partner at law firm Leigh Day which represented Asylum Aid in the case, said: \"We are delighted that the Court of Appeal has ruled that the Rwanda removals process is unlawful on grounds of safety.\"\n\nIt acknowledged that not all of the charity's challenges had been accepted by the court, but said the ruling had affirmed there are \"clear deficiencies\" with the policy.\n\nOther human rights groups have welcomed the court's decision, with Freedom From Torture describing it as a \"victory for reason and compassion\".\n\nThe PM has made \"stopping the boats\" a key government priority\n\nThe Rwanda policy has hit several roadblocks since it was first announced last April.\n\nThe first deportation flight was halted minutes before it was due to take off after a legal challenge was granted in June 2022.\n\nIn December, the High Court decided that the plan did not breach the UN's Refugee Convention -

So why do they have the biggest pay claim?\n\nThe origins of the walkout by British Medical Association members - the biggest by doctors in the history of the NHS - can be found in a series of discussions on social media platform Reddit in late 2021.\n\nA collection of junior doctors were expressing their dissatisfaction about pay.\n\nThe numbers chatting online grew quickly and by January 2022 it had led to the formation of the campaign group Doctors Vote, with the aim of restoring pay to the pre-austerity days of 2008.\n\nThe group began spreading its message via social media - and, within months, its supporters had won 26 of the 69 voting seats on the BMA ruling council, and 38 of the 68 on its junior doctor committee.\n\nDr Vivek Trivedi and Dr Rob Laurenson stood for BMA election on a Doctors Vote platform\n\nTwo of those who stood on the Doctors Vote platform - Dr Rob Laurenson and Dr Vivek Trivedi - became co-chairs of the committee.\n\n\"It was simply a group of doctors connecting up the dots,\" Dr Laurenson says. \"We reflect the vast majority of doctors,\" he adds, pointing to the mandate from the wider BMA junior doctor membership - 77% voted and of those, 98% backed strike action.\n\nAmong some of the older BMA heads, though, there is a sense of disquiet at the new guard. One senior doctor who has now stood down from a leadership role says: \"They're undoubtedly much more radical than we have seen before. But they haven't read the room - the pay claim makes them look silly.\"\n\nPublicly, the BMA prefers not to talk about wanting a pay rise. Instead, it uses the term \"pay restoration\" - to reverse cuts of 26% since 2008. This is the amount pay has fallen once inflation is taken into account.\n\nTo rectify a cut of 26% requires a bigger percentage increase because the amount is lower. This is why the BMA is actually after a 35% increase - and it is a rise it is calling for to be paid immediately.\n\nThe argument is more complicated than the ones put forward by most other unions - and because of that it has raised eyebrows.\n\nFirstly, no junior doctor has seen pay cut by 26% in that period. There are five core pay points in the junior doctor contract with each a springboard to the next. It means they move up the pay scale over time until they finish their training.\n\nA junior doctor in 2008 may well be a consultant now, perhaps earning four times in cash terms what they were then.\n\nSecondly, the 26% figure uses the retail price index (RPI) measure of inflation, which the Office for National Statistics says is a poor way to look at rising prices. Using the more favoured consumer price index measure, the cut is 16% - although the BMA defends its use of RPI as it takes into account housing costs.\n\n\"The drop in pay is also affected by the start-year chosen,\" Lucina Rolewicz, of the Nuffield Trust think tank, says. A more recent start date will show a smaller decline, as would going further back in the 2000s.\n\nAnother way of looking at pay is comparing it with wages across the economy by looking at where a job sits in terms of the lowest to highest earners.\n\nThe past decade has not been a boom time for wage growth in many fields, as austerity and the lack of economic growth has held back incomes.\n\nLast year, the independent Doctors' and Dentists' Remuneration Body looked at this. It found junior doctors had seen their pay, relative to others, fall slightly during the 2010s, but were still among the highest earners, with doctors fresh out of university immediately finding themselves in the top half of earners, while those at the end of training were just outside the top 10%.\n\nThen, of course, career prospects have to be considered. Consultants earn well more than \u00a3100,000 on average, putting them in the top 2%. GP partners earn even more.\n\nA pension of more than \u00a360,000 a year in today's prices also awaits those reaching such positions.\n\nBut while the scale of the pay claim is new, dissatisfaction with working conditions and pay pre-date the rise of the Doctors Vote movement.\n\nStudying medicine at university takes five years, meaning big debts for most. Dr Trivedi says \u00a380,000 of student loans are often topped up by private debt.\n\nOn top of that, doctors have to pay for ongoing exams and professional membership fees. Their junior doctor training can see them having to make several moves across the country and with little control over the hours they work.\n\nThis lasts many years - junior doctors can commonly spend close to a decade in training.\n\nIt is clearly hard work. And with services getting increasingly stretched, it is a job that doctors say is leaving them \"demoralised, angry and exhausted\", Dr Trivedi says, adding: \"Patient care is being compromised.\"\n\nBut while medicine is undoubtedly tough, it remains hugely attractive.\n\nJunior doctor posts in the early years are nearly always filled - it is not until doctors begin to specialise later in their training that significant gaps emerge in some specialities such as end-of-life care and sexual health.\n\nLooking at all doctor vacancy rates across the NHS around 6% of posts are unfilled - for nurses it is nearly twice that level.\n\nMany argue there is still a shortage - with not enough training places or funded doctor posts in the NHS in the first place.\n\nBut the fact the problems appear more severe in other NHS roles is a key reason why the government does not seem to be in a hurry to prioritise doctors - formal pay talks to avert strikes have begun with unions representing the rest of the workforce\n\n\"If we have some money to give a pay rise to NHS staff,\" a source close to the negotiations says, \"doctors are not at the front of the queue.\"\n\nAre you taking part in the strike action?

He reported no casualties.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine said four people were injured and a grain hangar was destroyed in an overnight Russian drone attacks on two ports on the River Danube, an alternative export route to the Black Sea, its southern Odesa region.\n\nRussia has been launching near-constant attacks on the Odesa region - where Ukraine's major Black Sea ports are located - since Russia withdrew from a landmark grain deal last week.\n\nIn Moscow, the city's Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said the drone strikes in the Russian capital hit \"two non-residential\" buildings around 04:00 local time (01:00 GMT). In a post on social media, he added that the buildings had not sustained any major damage.\n\nBut state news agencies reported that some drone fragments were found just 2km (1.2 miles) away from the defence ministry's buildings.\n\n\"A Kyiv regime attempt to carry out a terrorist act using two drones on objects on the territory of the city of Moscow was stopped,\" the Russian defence ministry said in a statement.\n\nRussian news agencies reported that drone debris was also found along the city's Komsomolsky Avenue.

Footage published on the military Zvezda TV channel showed missing windows at the top of the building.\n\nMoscow has accused Ukraine of a host of drone attacks on its territory in recent months.\n\nEarlier this month, Russia said Ukraine launched a drone attack on Moscow, forcing flights to be diverted from Vnukovo International Airport. Ukraine did not claim responsibility.\n\nAnd in May Kyiv denied carrying out a drone attack on the Kremlin, which Russia said amounted to an attempt on President Vladimir Putin's life.\n\nMonday's attack comes just a day after Russia targeted Odesa with missile strikes, destroying the historical Transfiguration Cathedral.\n\nUnesco, the UN's cultural agency, said it was \"deeply dismayed and condemns in the strongest terms\" the attack on the historic centre of Odesa.\n\n\"They will definitely feel this,\" he said during his nightly address from Kyiv. \"The target of all these missiles is not just cities, villages or people.

He responded to a failed 2016 coup by dramatically increasing his powers and cracking down on dissent.\n\nLeading Kurdish politicians have been jailed and other opposition figures threatened with a political ban.\n\nBut this election was the opposition's biggest hope of unseating the president yet.\n\nIncreasing numbers of Turks have blamed him for rampant inflation of 44%, and academics say the real rate is far higher than that.\n\nHe and his ruling AK Party were widely criticised for their response to the double earthquakes in February that left millions of Turks homeless in 11 provinces.\n\nAnd yet most of the cities which are considered Erdogan strongholds still gave him 60% of the vote.\n\nHis party is rooted in political Islam, but he has forged an alliance with the ultra-nationalist MHP.\n\nKemal Kilicdaroglu, 74, is an unlikely choice of candidate to unseat the president.\n\nHe is seen as a mild-mannered and bookish opponent and presided over a string of election defeats at the helm of the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP).\n\nHe polled well in the first round, taking Mr Erdogan to his first run-off, but not as well as the opinion polls had indicated he would.\n\nMr Kilicdaroglu secured the backing of six opposition parties, including the nationalist Good party and four smaller groups, which include two former Erdogan allies one of whom co-founded the AK Party.\n\nKemal Kilicdaroglu has agreed that the leaders of his alliance will all share the role of vice president\n\nHe also has the support of Turkey's second-biggest opposition party, the pro-Kurdish HDP, whose co-leader described the elections as \"the most crucial in Turkey's history\".\n\nHis biggest hope of snatching victory from a president buoyant after his first-round lead lies in increasing the support of both nationalist and Kurdish voters. A difficult feat when Turkey's nationalists want the next president to take a tougher line on Kurdish militants.\n\nIn the lead-up to the second round, he made a clear pitch to nationalist voters, banging his fists on the table and vowing to send home 3.5 million Syrian refugees. This was already his policy, but now he has decided to make a big point of it.\n\nKemal Kilicdaroglu's selection was not universally popular as the mayors of Istanbul and Ankara were potentially stronger candidates. Both are party colleagues who took control of Turkey's two biggest cities in 2019 for the CHP for the first time since 1994.\n\nHe is also a member of Turkey's Alevi minority, and when the opposition candidate drew attention to his roots Mr Erdogan accused him of seeking to exploit it.\n\nHis Nation Alliance, also known as the Table of Six, are united in their desire to return Turkey from the presidential system created under Mr Erdogan to one led by parliament.\n\nThe leaders of the other five members of the alliance have agreed to take on the roles of vice-president. But even if they were to win the presidency, the Erdogan alliance won a majority in parliament on 14 May and would make reforms very difficult.\n\nTurnout in the first round was already very high at almost 89% among voters in Turkey.\n\nIf Mr Kilicdaroglu is to make up the 2.5 million votes between him and President Erdogan, he will need to win over voters who backed ultranationalist candidate Sinan Ogan who came third in the first round with 2.8 million votes.\n\nThat task was made even harder when Mr Ogan endorsed the president.\n\nHis demand is for a tougher stance on tackling Kurdish militants and returning Syrian refugees.\n\nMr Kilicdaroglu had already adopted a more strident tone on Syrians since the first round, promising to \"send away\" all refugees as soon as he came to power.\n\nReacting to Mr Ogan's decision to back his rival, he said the vote was now a referendum: \"We are coming to save this country from terrorism and refugees.\"\n\nPresident Erdogan said he had made no deals with Mr Ogan: 450,000 refugees had already returned home and the plan was to send back another million, he said.\n\nThe ruling AK Party of Recep Tayyip Erdogan has forged an alliance with the nationalist MHP and together they have secured a majority of 322 seats in the 600-seat parliament, down on five years ago.\n\nParties tend to form alliances because they need a minimum of 7% support to enter parliament.\n\nThe six-party opposition wants to change that but its Nation Alliance only managed 212 seats.\n\nThe pro-Kurdish party ran under the banner of the Green Left to avoid a potential election ban, and came third with 61 seats.\n\nUnder the Erdogan reforms, it is now the president who chooses the government, so there is no prime minister.\n\nUnder Turkey's revamped constitution allowing only two terms as president, Mr Erdogan would have to stand down in 2028 if he won the 28 May run-off. There are currently no plans for a successor.\n\nHe has already served two terms but Turkey's YSK election board ruled that his first term should be seen as starting not in 2014 but in 2018, when the new presidential system began with elections for parliament and president on the same day.\n\nOpposition politicians had earlier asked the YSK to block his candidacy.\n\nUnder an Erdogan presidency, Turkey can expect increased control of state institutions and the media and a greater crackdown on dissent. Inflation is likely to remain high because of his preference for low interest rates.\n\nInternationally, he could continue to resist Sweden's bid to join Nato and will paint himself as a mediator between Ukraine and Russia.\n\nMr Kilicdaroglu and his allies want to remove the president's right to veto legislation, cutting the post's ties to political parties and making it electable every seven years.\n\nHe wants to bring inflation down to 10% and send 3.5 million Syrian refugees home. President Erdogan has promised to speed up the voluntary repatriation of a million Syrians.\n\nMr Kilicdaroglu also wants kickstart Turkey's decades-long bid to join the European Union and restore \"mutual trust\" with the US, after years of fractious relations during the Erdogan years.", "Elton John told his millions of fans on Saturday night that they would remain in his \"head, heart and soul\", concluding his marathon farewell tour in Stockholm with one of his biggest hits - Goodbye Yellow Brick Road.\n\nThe 76-year-old singer has won five Grammy awards in a spectacular career spanning 50 years and nearly 4,600 performances worldwide.\n\n\"It's been my lifeblood to play for you guys, and you've been absolutely magnificent,\" he told the audience at Sweden's Tele2 Arena.\n\nElton John paid an emotional tribute to his current band and crew, some of whom have been touring with him for many years.\n\n\"They're really incredible,\" he said, \"and they are the best, I tell you, the best.\"\n\nHe kicked off his show with Bennie and the Jets, and went on to perform many other hits, including Philadelphia Freedom, Tiny Dancer, Rocket Man and Candle in the Wind.\n\nHis Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour began in North America in 2018, and this was his second night performing in Stockholm.\n\nThe tour spanned the globe - he played to more than six million fans, and one of the highlights was his headline slot at the Glastonbury Festival last month.\n\nThat concert drew one of the biggest crowds in the festival's history and a British TV audience of millions.\n\nHis gig in Stockholm included a video message from Coldplay, who were performing in the Swedish city of Gothenburg at the same time.\n\nThe band's Chris Martin told Elton: \"From all the bands and artists you've helped and inspired, we love you so much.\n\n\"We are so grateful for everything you've done for the Aids Foundation, anytime you've been kind to anybody,\" he said.\n\nIt is one of the highest-grossing concert tours ever: Billboard magazine reports that it is the first to reach ticket sales of $900m (\u00a3701m).\n\nElton reflected on his life towards the end of this grand finale, telling the audience about his \"52 years of pure joy playing music\".\n\nHe confirmed he would \"never be touring again\", but he may do a \"one-off thing\" in future.\n\n\"I want to appreciate my family, my sons, my husband, everything.

A separate warning has been issued for the whole of Northern Ireland for Sunday, from 10:00 until 21:00.\n\nGenerally a Met Office yellow warning for thunderstorms means there is a small chance homes and businesses could be flooded quickly and communities cut off by floodwater, while public transport risks being cancelled in affected areas.\n\nAt-risk areas will most likely be across east Wales, England and into south-east Scotland, according to BBC Weather's Simon King.\n\nThe storms will be quite localised but \"could be nasty\" if you get caught up in one, the forecaster said, with torrential rain, lightning, hail, gusty winds and the risk of some localised flooding all possible.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nLincoln, in the East Midlands, York in the north-east of England and Carlisle, which sits on the border with Scotland, had all experienced thunder and rain by midday on Saturday, according to the Met Office.\n\nIn Scotland, those attending the second day of TRNSMT music festival in Glasgow were warned to expect warm spells of 24C alongside high winds and thundery downpours.\n\nOn Friday, it was announced the Tiree Music Festival, usually held off the west coast of the country, could not go ahead due to gale force winds.\n\nFurther public events have been impacted by the weather in England - two major sporting events in particular.\n\nShowers disrupted play at Wimbledon, south-west London, but they should ease later this afternoon with increasing sunshine expected into this evening, BBC Weather's Simon King said.\n\nAs the sixth day of the tennis tournament got under way, some of the early matches - which began at 11:00 - were suspended after heavy rain began to fall on the outside courts.\n\nAt the men's Ashes, in Headingley, Leeds, play could only begin at 16:45 after persistent rain hampered proceedings on the third day of the cricket series.\n\nSunday will be a drier day for most of the UK, however there will still be some showers around with sunny spells in between, BBC Weather's Stav Danaos said.\n\nThere is a chance of rain across south-east England and East Anglia in the morning and some of this could be thundery as it pushes north-eastwards, he said.\n\nThe forecaster added that the main focus of the heavy showers and thunderstorms on Sunday will be across Northern Ireland.\n\nIt is expected to feel cooler and fresher with less humidity across the UK compared to Saturday.\n\u2022 None How do the new heat-health alerts work?", "Liam Holden was 19 when he was arrested and convicted of a soldier's murder\n\nIt happened almost 40 years ago, but Liam Holden can still recall the sensation of gasping for breath as water was slowly poured on to a towel covering his face.\n\n\"That feeling will never leave me,\" he says.\n\n\"Even talking about it now, I get a gagging sensation in my throat.\"\n\nHe was 19 at the time and was being questioned by members of the Parachute Regiment about the murder of a soldier, Private Frank Bell.\n\nHe died three days after being shot in the head as he patrolled in the Springfield Avenue area of west Belfast in September 1972.\n\nThe teenage chef was taken from his home and brought to an army post at Blackmountain school, where he was held for almost five hours.\n\nBy the end of his time in military custody, he had agreed to sign a statement admitting he had shot the soldier.\n\n\"By the time they were finished with me I would have admitted to killing JFK,\" he says.\n\nSo what did the Army do during that time? Liam Holden says he was subjected to sustained torture and then threatened that he would be shot if he did not confess to the killing.\n\n\"I was beaten and they told me to admit I had shot the soldier, but I said that wasn't true because I didn't.\n\n\"Then six soldiers came into the cubicle where I was being held and grabbed me. They held me down on the floor and one of them placed a towel over my face, and they got water and they started pouring the water through the towel all round my face, very slowly,\" he says.\n\n\"After a while you can't get your breath but you still try to get your breath, so when you were trying to breathe in through your mouth you are sucking the water in, and if you try to breathe in through your nose, you are sniffing the water in.\n\nLiam Holden says those who forced him to sign the confession knew he was innocent\n\n\"It was continual, a slow process, and at the end of it you basically feel like you are suffocating. They did not stop until I passed out, or was close to passing out.\n\n\"They repeated that three or four times, but were still getting the same answer. I told them I had not shot the soldier.\"\n\nMr Holden, now a father of two, said the soldiers then changed tactics and put a hood over his head and told him he was going to be shot.\n\n\"They put me into a car and took me for a drive and said they were bringing me to a loyalist area,\" he said.\n\n\"I couldn't see where I was but I was in a field somewhere. One of the soldiers put a gun to my head and said that if I didn't admit to killing the soldier that they were going to shoot me and just leave me there.\n\n\"I had a hood over my head and a gun at my head in the middle of a field and was told I would be killed if I didn't admit it. There were no ifs or buts, I just said I did it.\n\n\"I didn't think about going to prison or anything like that, I just confessed to make them stop.\"\n\nThe term \"waterboarding\" was not in use at the time, but Mr Holden's description of what happened to him, which he outlined in court at the time, are remarkably similar to the accounts of others who claim to have been subjected to the same form of torture by the CIA in recent years.\n\nAlthough Mr Holden had an alibi for the time of the shooting, and the only evidence against him was the confession he said he had been forced to sign, he was convicted.\n\n\"They knew I did not shoot that soldier, they knew. There was no evidence whatsoever apart from that statement that I signed,\" he says.\n\nHe was released from prison in 1989 after serving 17 years. Since then, he has campaigned to clear his name and the Criminal Cases Review Commission, which was established to investigate possible miscarriages of justice, referred his case to the Court of Appeal.\n\nThe commission took the decision based on new evidence and doubts about \"the admissibility of reliability\" of his confession.\n\nSome of the new material included evidence discovered by a Guardian journalist, Ian Cobain, that water torture was used by the British military at the time, despite repeated denials. The journalist was an expert witness for Mr Holden's legal team.\n\nLast month, Mr Holden was granted permission to appeal after the Public Prosecution Service said it would not oppose the move. A spokesman for the PPS said its decision was based on confidential evidence compiled by the Criminal Cases Review Commission which had not been available to prosecutors at the time of the trial.\n\n\"The court of trial was therefore deprived of relevant material that might have led to a different outcome on the question of the admissibility of the incriminating statements, which were the sole basis of the conviction,\" the spokesman added.\n\n\"In those circumstances the director concluded that it would not be appropriate to oppose the appeal.\"\n\nLiam Holden said he lost his family as well as his liberty during those 17 years in jail.\n\n\"I have five brothers and five sisters, but I don't really know them. The older ones moved on, got married and had their own families while I was in jail. The ones who were younger than me when I was sent to prison didn't get the chance to get to know me.\"\n\nHis mother died a year after he was released, and his father a short time later.\n\n\"I'm just sorry they aren't around to see the outcome of this appeal, to see the stigma removed from my name.

Kirsten Dunst opens up about the Hollywood gender pay gap\n\nHollywood star Kirsten Dunst has said she grew up at a time when there was \"major pay disparity\" between herself and her male co-stars.\n\nShe said she was paid less than male co-stars, even though she had more box office success, with films such as Jumanji (1995) and Bring It On (2000).\n\n\"I was very young and it just felt like at the time, what do you do?\" she said.\n\n\"I was 17, I was still learning my taste in film. I didn't even think to ask,\" she added.\n\nDunst has previously referred to the pay gap between her and actor Tobey Maguire, who she starred alongside in Spider-Man in 2002, as \"very extreme\".\n\nAlex Garland, who directs Dunst in his latest film, Civil War, agreed it had been a major issue but \"nobody questioned it, male executives didn't question it, these were all inherited opinions. They weren't thought about.\"\n\nDunst plays a war photographer documenting the United States in the grip of conflict and falling apart.\n\nThe star says the dystopian movie is \"very much a warning\" about what can happen.\n\nThe film \"leaves people with so much to think about\" and \"is a very moving, realistic piece about journalists\", the actress adds.\n\nDunst, 41, says it is refreshing her character is the lead in an action film and not a \"damsel in distress\".\n\nShe drew inspiration for the role from the famed war correspondent, Marie Colvin.\n\nThe actress plays a war photographer in her new film, Civil War\n\nIn the film, US government forces are fighting the separatist \"Western Forces\" led by Texas and California.\n\nThe civil war of the film's title appears to have been sparked by the president, played by Nick Offerman, who has ripped up the constitution by serving a third term in office (no-one is allowed to serve as president more than twice).\n\nParallels have been drawn to current US politics and events such as the 6 January insurrection, when supporters of Donald Trump attacked the Capitol Building in Washington DC.\n\nBut Garland, who also wrote the film, says the themes are not just about the US.\n\n\"The film is set in America but really this film is about two things. It is about journalists and it's about polarisation. Populist politics and polarisation which lead to extremism and extremist thinking.\"\n\nGarland, who wrote 28 Days Later and Ex Machina, adds: \"That's happening in America but it's happening here in this country [the UK] and it's been happening here for a long time and it's happening across Europe, the Middle East, Asia. I could list the countries where that would be true.\"\n\nHe adds that journalism is \"under attack\" which he finds \"strange, scary and dangerous\".\n\n\"You get people saying 'Do not trust the BBC' and you will be in places where you would be attacked and criticised for saying the unbiased news reporting organisation that you belong to.\"\n\nThe director says he was trying to showcase \"old fashioned journalists\" who document what is happening, without bias or opinion and leave other people to interpret what they do.\n\nAlex Garland wrote and directed the film while Nick Offerman stars as the president\n\nThe film has garnered largely positive reviews, with The Telegraph's Robbie Collin awarding it five stars.\n\n\"Civil War moves in ways you'd forgotten films of this scale could,\" he wrote, \"with compassion for its lead characters and a dark, prowling intellect, and yet a simultaneous total commitment to thrilling the audience at every single moment.\n\n\"Each leg of the journey toggles between pin-drop suspense and rivetingly frantic firefights, often staged with a mesmerisingly surreal edge.\"\n\nEmpire's John Nugent, giving it four stars, added: \"It never lets up, always gripping, always pummelling your senses, always ghoulishly compelling. Whatever your response to its political prevarication, this is undeniably confident, intense, sweaty-palmed filmmaking at the highest level.\"\n\nBut the Guardian's Adrian Horton was less keen, awarding it three stars overall. Civil War is \"decidedly anti-war but firmly unspecific\", she said, \"assiduously avoiding any direct correlation to current politics or, it turns out, any politics at all\".\n\n\"The distance,\" she concluded, \"makes for an at times frustrating watch - stimulating on the level of adrenaline, not emotions.\"\n\nDunst grew up in front of the camera, beginning her career when she was three years old.\n\nShe says pay disparity isn't the only issue when it comes to sexism in the movie industry.\n\nOne of Dunst's leading roles in her early 20s was in Sofia Coppola's 2006 Marie Antoinette biopic.\n\nShe played the titular role and says the movie \"was panned\" by film critics.\n\n\"The people that were watching that movie were my age, they weren't movie reviewers. Movie reviewers were old men. So to me, the people that enjoyed Marie Antoinette have now grown up and are like 'We loved this movie' but they weren't the people writing the reviews.\n\n\"We grew up in a world where it's man-kind, man-made, man this, man that, that's how we grew up.\"\n\nBut Dunst does think times have changed: \"Hopefully, the way I carve my path will help other actresses.\"\n\nCivil War is released in the UK, US and Canada on 12 April.", "The then Prince Charles meets fishmonger Pat O'Connell at the English Market in Cork in 2018\n\nAs King Charles III prepares to take to the throne he also takes on another legacy left over by his mother.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II's 2011 trip to the Republic of Ireland is often seen as a turning point in Anglo-Irish relations.\n\nWill her son continue those steps in reconciliation and what has his relationship been with the Republic of Ireland?\n\nMarie Coleman, professor of 20th Century history at Queen's University Belfast, said that rather than building on his mother's legacy he is \"continuing his own legacy of building those good relations\".\n\n\"The Queen's visit didn't happen in isolation.

The Republic of Ireland was not represented in 1953 so it's quite an important departure for the Republic of Ireland also.\"\n\nEven more significant is the presence of Sinn F\u00e9in vice-president Michelle O'Neill - who has accepted an invitation to attend the coronation.\n\n\"It's even an advance on Sinn F\u00e9in's position last September, at the time of the death of the Queen, where they drew a distinction between attending events which marked the passing of the Queen, and not attending events which mark the accession of the new King,\" said Prof Coleman.\n\n\"So it looks like their position has even developed from that,\" she added.\n\nHowever, the academic said that much of the progress made in Anglo-Irish relations has been affected by Brexit.\n\nBrexit - the UK's departure from the EU - saw it leave a union once shared with Ireland.\n\nIt also raised questions of sovereignty, identity and borders.\n\nHas the drawn-out departure and protracted negotiations over the Irish border and trade put extra strain on relations between the two governments?\n\nProf Coleman said the process had \"damaged those good relations which the Queen had done so much to forge particularly during that visit in 2011\".", "Ronan Kanda was mistaken by his murderers for his friend\n\nTwo 17-year-olds have been sentenced for stabbing a 16-year-old boy to death in a case of mistaken identity.\n\nRonan Kanda was murdered close to his home in Wolverhampton after he visited a friend's house to buy a PlayStation controller in June 2022.\n\nA trial heard his attackers, one of whom had just collected knives bought online, mistook him for his friend.\n\nPrabjeet Veadhesa will serve a minimum term of 18 years and Sukhman Shergill a minimum of 16, the court heard.\n\nBefore passing sentence at Wolverhampton Crown Court, the judge, Mr Justice Choudhury, lifted reporting restrictions on naming the teenagers.\n\nHe made the decision in part to send out a strong message about the seriousness of knife crime, he said.\n\nRonan's mother, Pooja Kanda, said she had lost a lifetime of dreams and ambitions\n\nThe court was told Veadhesa was owed money by Ronan's friend and intended to confront him on 29 June 2022.\n\nThe judge said it was a \"tragic coincidence\" they saw Ronan leave the house where their intended victim lived and assumed he was the boy they were looking for.\n\nHe was just yards away from his family home, but was attacked from behind as he listened to music on headphones.\n\nEarlier in the day, Veadhesa had collected a ninja sword set and a large machete from a local post office after buying them online using a fake name.\n\nThe court heard Shergill carried the machete but Ronan was stabbed twice with the sword by Veadhesa and died at the scene.\n\nHe suffered a 20cm-deep wound in his back and hip area, and a 17cm-deep wound in his chest.\n\nThe pair fled after they realised they had attacked the wrong person, dumping their weapons and clothes.\n\nRonan's parents and sister as well as other supporters wore \"Justice for Ronan\" T-shirts at Wolverhampton Crown Court\n\nMany of Ronan's family, who were in the courtroom wearing \"Justice for Ronan\" T-shirts, sobbed as tributes were read during the hearing.\n\nRonan's mother, Pooja Kanda, read out a personal statement and said she replayed the last time she saw her son alive in her mind every day.\n\n\"I have lost a lifetime of dreams, hopes and ambitions,\" she said. \"He was the son that every mother needs.\"\n\nAddressing the defendants, who both looked at the floor as she spoke, she told them \"your evil actions have taken my son's life\" which left her with \"nothing but hatred for this world\".\n\nHis father, Chander Kanda, said the death of his son had destroyed his life.\n\nRonan's sister, Nikita Kanda, said she was \"no longer the same person\" and added \"my world has stopped, I feel empty and I'm just surviving\".\n\nAlthough Shergill, from Willenhall, did not inflict any blows, a jury found he acted in the joint enterprise of his murder and convicted both teenagers after a five-week trial.\n\nIn defence of Veadhesa, from Walsall, Adam Morgan said his client was of good character and was \"genuinely remorseful\".\n\nTimothy Hannam KC, defending Shergill, said his client should be treated more leniently as \"Veadhesa was the one who actually killed Ronan\".\n\nWest Midlands Police described it as an \"unbelievably callous and shocking case of mistaken identity\".\n\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

The place is getting worse.\"\n\nThe message in February, which I received from a member of the maternity team, was stark but unsurprising. In a series of texts over the previous few months, the person had been getting increasingly concerned about what was happening at the East Kent trust.\n\nThe leadership is \"totally ineffective\" read one message. \"How long do we have to keep hearing this narrative - we accept bad things happened, we have learned and are putting it right. Nothing changes.\"\n\nFriday's report from the Care Quality Commission (CQC) is unfortunately just the latest marker in a near-decade of failure to improve maternity care at the trust. The revelation that inspectors considered closing the unit at the William Harvey Hospital in Ashford comes nine years after the trust's head of midwifery made a similar recommendation for the same reasons - that it was a danger to women and babies. The failure to act decisively then allowed many poor practices to continue.\n\nAn independent review published last October found that between 2009 and 2020, at least 45 babies may have survived with better care, while 12 other babies and 23 mothers wouldn't have suffered harm if they'd received good maternity care.\n\nPut simply, the trust has repeatedly failed to provide good care - and then failed to act when presented with evidence of poor care.\n\nConsider the extraordinary deaths of two new mothers from herpes at two of the trust's hospitals, just six weeks apart in 2018. The trust told the families there was no connection between the deaths. There were. A BBC investigation three years later found they'd been operated on by the same surgeon, and that the trust had failed to test him for herpes despite being told to do so.\n\nWhen those disclosures led to an inquest being ordered, the trust delayed its start for weeks by making last-minute legal arguments about wanting the coroner to put reporting restrictions on naming the surgeon, arguments it could have made months earlier, as it had been repeatedly discussed at previous hearings.\n\nWhen the inquest took evidence, a consultant microbiologist at the trust, Dr Sam Moses, was reprimanded for allegedly coaching a colleague in how to respond to answers while another clinician was sitting in the witness box.\n\nDr Moses also admitted that he hadn't told one family about the connections between the deaths, despite being in a meeting in which the mother of one of the women who had died asked explicitly about a link. He told the court that \"my role was to assist the trust. I didn't know whose responsibility it was to tell\" about the connection.\n\nAt the heart of the trust's problems, it seems, is a dysfunctional culture that stretches back almost a decade. In 2015, a review of its maternity services by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists found multiple problems, including consultants failing to carry out ward rounds, assess women or attend out-of-hours calls. The report was dismissed as \"a load of rubbish\" by the trust. A Maternity Improvement Plan, overseen by NHS England, was devised. However, by the end of 2019 fewer than a quarter of its action points had been completed.\n\nImproving care is virtually impossible if colleagues don't get along. An Employment Tribunal decision, published in February, concluded that a \"toxic and difficult working environment\" existed at William Harvey Hospital's maternity unit where people were \"shouted and sworn at over differences of professional opinion\".\n\nOlukemi Akinmeji, a black midwife, sued the trust for race discrimination and victimisation after colleagues \"joked\" that they should \"check their bags\" on her last day at the hospital. Ms Akinmeji, who worked at the William Harvey between 2018 and 2020, won her case.\n\nThe tribunal judgement described hearing evidence of a broken working environment and a foul-mouthed registrar that one former colleague described as \"totally unprofessional\". Since Ms Akinmeji left the trust, that doctor has been promoted to consultant, after apparently being told to cut out the swearing.\n\nThree former staff have told the BBC there is a clique of senior midwives at the William Harvey, nicknamed by some as \"the untouchables\". They are described as \"watching each other's backs\", swearing, prone to talking disparagingly about both patients and colleagues. They've been working there for many years and are resistant to new working methods, and often, outsiders.\n\n\"It is the worst trust I've ever worked for,\" says one, \"there is so much unprofessional behaviour\". Another former staff member says,\"midwives often left the end of their shifts in tears, or broke down during a shift. People felt they couldn't speak up - even the managers had their favourites.\"\n\nIn that context, it's little wonder that the CQC found low morale and low levels of staff satisfaction, particularly among maternity staff at the William Harvey. Last year's staff survey, recently published, found that on all nine measures rated - including \"we are safe and healthy\" and \"we are always learning\" - the scores from all maternity staff were significantly lower than elsewhere in the trust. Bear in mind that the trust's overall scores included some of the lowest scores of any trust in England.\n\nIt's not as if East Kent has been left alone to sort its problems out. NHS England has been all over the trust for years, overseeing improvement plans and sending, as it announced in 2020, \"an expert team into the trust to ensure that improvements are made immediately\". Asked why their effort hadn't improved maternity care, NHS England couldn't provide an answer but said they had helped them recruit more nurses and midwives.\n\nIn a statement to the BBC, the East Kent trust said it accepted it \"was not consistently providing the standards of maternity care women and families should expect.\" But it says that in the past few years, it has \"worked hard to improve services,\" including investing \"to increase the number of midwifes and doctors\" and to improve staff training.\n\nOn the final day of evidence in the inquest into the two deaths from herpes, in a different room in the same building, a pre-inquest review was taking place into the death of a 14-day-old boy in September 2022 at the William Harvey Hospital. Evidence heard at that hearing suggests that with better care, his death may have been avoided. The full inquest later this year will come to a final conclusion.\n\nThe baby's death, the CQC report and its actions at the herpes inquest show that East Kent's problem are deep-rooted and ongoing, and that multiple changes of various directors over many years have led to little discernible improvement.", "Thousands of children with severe developmental disorders have finally been given a diagnosis, in a study that found 60 new diseases.\n\nChildren, and their parents, had their genetic code - or DNA - analysed in the search for answers to their condition.\n\nThere are thousands of different genetic disorders.\n\nHaving a diagnosis can lead to better care, help parents to decide whether to have more children, or simply provide an explanation for what is happening.\n\nTaken individually the disorders are rare, but collectively they affect one in every 17 people in the UK.\n\nThe Deciphering Developmental Disorders study, conducted over 10 years in the UK and Ireland, was a collaboration between the NHS, universities and the Sanger Institute, which specialises in analysing DNA.\n\nAmong the findings, researchers discovered Turnpenny-Fry syndrome. It is caused by errors in one genetic instruction within our DNA and leads to learning difficulties. It also affects growth, resulting in a large forehead and sparse hair.\n\nJessica Fisher's son, Mungo - who took part in the study - was diagnosed with the syndrome.\n\nAt the time, he was one of only two people in the world to be diagnosed with it. The other child was in Australia, but Jessica recalls that the Australian child's physical similarities to Mungo were so strong they \"could have been his sibling\".\n\nJessica subsequently started an online support group, which is now made up of 36 families from around the world, including America, Brazil, Croatia and Indonesia.\n\n\"It's devastating to learn that your child has a rare genetic disorder, but getting the diagnosis has been key to bringing us together,\" said Jessica.\n\nThe study analysed the genetic code of 13,500 families with unexplained disorders - and was able to give a diagnosis to 5,500 of them.\n\nThe results, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, revealed 60 of those disorders were new conditions. Most were errors that had occurred spontaneously at conception, rather than being inherited.\n\nProf Caroline Wright, from the University of Exeter, told the BBC: \"We were able to find new genetic conditions, which means that not only people in the study benefit, but there are huge benefits to future generations.\n\n\"Getting a genetic diagnosis is hugely important to families. It allows them to speak to other families who might be affected by the same condition, and hopefully target much more personalised management and ultimately treatment.\"\n\nAround a quarter of children in the study had their treatment changed once a clear diagnosis was given.\n\nThis kind of genetic analysis is becoming more routine within NHS care.\n\nThe discovery of Turnpenny-Fry syndrome meant Dasha Brogden's daughter, Sofia, was diagnosed when she was just one month old.\n\nHer diagnosis made everyone aware heart conditions were a possibility, and a scan led to Sofia - now aged nearly three - having surgery when she was two months old.\n\nDasha, from Oxfordshire, said: \"For us, getting a diagnosis really helped us to understand what to expect. Compared to families who came before the condition had an official diagnosis, we were lucky.", "The ICC's Karim Khan played an integral part in issuing the arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin in March\n\nThe International Criminal Court says it is \"undeterred\" by Russia putting its chief prosecutor on a wanted list.\n\nIt comes two months after the ICC's Karim Khan issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nIn a statement on Saturday, the court said the move was an attempt to undermine its \"lawful mandate to ensure accountability for the gravest crimes\".\n\nRussia, which is not an ICC member, previously described the warrant against Mr Putin as being \"void\".\n\nMr Khan, a British lawyer, issued the arrest warrant for President Putin in March.

Ibrahimovic had already announced he would leave the Italian club. He scored 511 goals for clubs including Paris St-Germain, Manchester United and both AC and Inter Milan, winning league titles in four countries.\n\u2022 None How well do you know Ibrahimovic? Ibrahimovic began his second spell with AC Milan in early 2020, having won the Scudetto with them in 2011, and helped them win the title again last season. But he played only four times and started one match for the Serie A side this term - and scored one goal - following a series of injuries, and his contract was set to expire this month. \"There are too many emotions for me right now. Forza Milan and goodbye,\" an emotional Ibrahimovic said, holding back tears. \"The first time I came here you gave me happiness, the second time you gave me love. \"You welcomed me with open arms, you made me feel at home, I will be a Milanista for the rest of my life.\" Ibrahimovic won 34 trophies - including 14 league titles - in a career that began in the last century, and was nominated for the Ballon d'Or 11 times. The one major club trophy that eluded him was the Champions League, with his only European title coming with Manchester United in the shape of the 2017 Europa League. The striker also retires as Sweden's all-time top scorer with 62 international goals in 122 matches. He quit the national side after Euro 2016 but returned in 2021 for their unsuccessful World Cup qualifying campaign. \"I used to be scared when journalists asked by about my future, but now I can accept it, I'm ready,\" he told reporters after his announcement. \"I've been doing this all my life.

A move to Italy followed in 2004 with Juventus, where he won two league titles, both of which were later stripped from the club as a result of the Calciopoli scandal. However, the Swede won three more Serie A titles with his next club, Inter Milan, before a move to Barcelona in 2009.

The weather's pretty mean and it's going be a huge job,\" he said.\n\n\"The best way to do it is to lay out a grid across the whole island.\"\n\nThat entails laying a trap every 250m, the range an individual ferret will cover.\n\nEverywhere will need to be targeted, said James, including grassy ledges scattered down the cliffs - an undertaking that requires some extreme training.\n\n\"There'll be a huge amount, obviously abseiling, rope access skills, off-roading skills, all terrain vehicles, obviously first aid, things like that.\n\n\"By the end of it we'll be an elite force.\"\n\nHe added: \"And all of that will take place during winter. So absolutely the worst time of year, really, for us walking around.\"\n\nBut winter is the best time to target predators, who will be getting hungry as their prey migrates from the island.\n\nProtecting the seabird population is also about protecting people.\n\nThe economy on the island relies on thousands of visitors who come here every year for the wildlife.\n\nThe cliffs on Rathlin Island are thronged with sea birds\n\nSo while conservation like this - destroying one species to protect another - can be controversial, people on Rathlin are wholeheartedly behind the project.\n\n\"The island resident population have started to catch on to this,\" said Michael Cecil, chair of the Rathlin Development and Community Association.\n\n\"There's more and more interest from around the world, from scientific communities and other islands that are interested in similar things. So yeah, we're starting to pick up a bit of notice, more and more so and islanders are starting to talk about this project.\"\n\nSimilar projects have been undertaken on the Isles of Scilly, in the Shiants off Scotland and, most recently, on Gough Island in the south Atlantic\n\nBut this is the first time that ferrets will be targeted as part of a conservation effort like this.\n\n\"It's not cheap to get rid of these animals, but it's hugely beneficial for the wildlife here,\" said James.\n\n\"Nature is in crisis. We're looking at climate change. We're looking at overfishing at sea and this is the best way to really protect the island for future generations and just give them a bit of a buffer zone to face these overarching global problems.\"\n\nIt will take time for the populations to recover, but at the upside-down lighthouse that is home to Rathlin's Seabird Centre, Liam McFaul is hopeful.\n\n\"Seabirds are a very long-lived species and you're taking out the predators. You're not going to just immediately see next year lots and lots more birds, it'll take a number of years for them to build up.\n\n\"Rathlin is an internationally important mixed seabird colony. There's 150,000 guillemots and 22,000 razorbills, that's just literally breeding birds sitting on the cliffs.\n\n\"When you look on the sea, that's just peppered with birds and you look in the air, they're flying all over the place.\n\n\"So a census of these birds only takes consideration of what's sitting on eggs and on the cliffs. There's thousands and thousands more that's not counted.\n\n\"So lots and lots of monitoring will be done over the next few years, to see the changes from the predators being taken out.\"", "PC Bettley-Smith's lawyer said of the events: \"There's a huge difference between reading about it, and being there\"\n\nA PC's second set of blows to ex-footballer Dalian Atkinson on the night he was killed by her colleague was \"wholly unjustified\" and \"outrageous\", a disciplinary panel has heard.\n\nMary Ellen Bettley-Smith beat Mr Atkinson multiple times with her baton as he lay on the ground in 2016.\n\nA criminal retrial last year acquitted her of actual bodily harm.\n\nIn a separate police hearing, she denies excessive force amounting to gross misconduct.\n\nMr Atkinson died after being tasered and kicked in the head by PC Bettley-Smith's West Mercia Police colleague, and romantic partner, PC Benjamin Monk, who was jailed for Mr Atkinson's manslaughter in 2021.\n\nThe panel, sitting in Telford on Thursday, heard how the PCs had responded to a 999 call, arriving to find Mr Atkinson outside his father's Telford home, appearing \"in the grip of a psychotic episode\".\n\nThe hearing was told how PC Bettley-Smith, 33, had initially hit Mr Atkinson three times with her baton.\n\nWith Mr Atkinson tasered and kicked by Monk, she struck the former Aston Villa, Ipswich Town and Sheffield Wednesday striker a further three times, telling the panel she was \"looking over her right shoulder\" to see back-up arriving.\n\nOutlining the case against her, Dijen Basu KC said: \"The second set [of blows] were wholly unnecessary, wholly unreasonable, wholly unjustified and above all, to use normal language, it was outrageous to do that in the circumstances.\n\n\"The man had just been kicked in the head, having been tasered, and dropped to the floor, and with other officers arriving.\"\n\nPC Benjamin Monk was found guilty of the manslaughter of Dalian Atkinson but cleared of his murder\n\nPC Bettley-Smith told the panel during her evidence on Wednesday: \"I just remember what I perceived to be a really aggressive, hostile, growling [person] and just thought we had antagonised him even more by tasering him.\n\n\"I perceived him to be trying to propel himself to get up and proceeded to strike Mr Atkinson to the fleshy areas of his body to try and get him down and under control.\"\n\nBut the hearing previously heard that at least three different residents, watching from their windows, described how Mr Atkinson did not move once felled by the taser.\n\nA joint medical report summary recorded Mr Atkinson probably hit his head on the road as he was grounded by a 33-second-long taser burst, and this was \"likely to have caused concussion, exacerbated by any kick or kicks to the head\" which would possibly have \"deepened any loss of consciousness\".\n\nThe report concluded it was \"possible... he was too exhausted to move once the taser was turned off\".\n\nDalian Atkinson died after being tasered by PC Bettley-Smith's partner, Benjamin Monk\n\nIn his closing arguments, Patrick Gibbs, Bettley-Smith's barrister, said: \"To state the very obvious, this is a short incident, takes place in the dark, it was unexpected, violent.\n\n\"Although we examine it in calm and peaceful circumstances, unless you have ever been threatened with violence and had to face it, it may be it is hard to appreciate fully what it's like.\n\n\"There's a huge difference between reading about it, and being there.\"\n\nThe panel is set to deliver its finding on Friday, with PC Bettley-Smith facing the sack if the hearing finds against her.\n\nMr Atkinson started his football career at Ipswich Town, before moving to Sheffield Wednesday, Real Sociedad, Aston Villa and Fenerbah\u00e7e in the 1990s.\n\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Moscow has denied destroying the dam, instead blaming Ukrainian shelling.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on the plane to the US, Mr Sunak said it was \"too soon\" to make a \"definitive judgement\" on whether Russia was behind the attack.\n\nBut he said if Russia were found to be responsible, it would \"demonstrate the new lows that we will have seen from Russian aggression.\"", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. WATCH: \"We feel so excited, we feel so happy\"\n\nA group of Ugandan children is on the verge of glory after reaching the final of hit UK talent show Britain's Got Talent, where they have won over the judges and the public with their dazzling dance moves and bubbly personalities.\n\nThey have already made history after becoming the first act to be given a \"golden buzzer\" by one of the judges before they had even finished their performance. This sent them straight through to Wednesday's semi-final, where they received most public votes, meaning they are now among the 10 acts taking part in Sunday's final.\n\nThe group of six children aged between six and 13 all come from impoverished backgrounds in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, where they were taken in and cared for by their guardian-turned manager Dauda Kavuma.\n\nHe told the BBC that he hopes their success can encourage other children living in similar circumstances.\n\n\"We feel so happy to keep doing this and to bring hope to all the children around the world who are in the ghetto, who are disadvantaged, who are less privileged - that they can make it in life.\"\n\nWhile they are winning over a new audience in the UK, the Ghetto Kids are already a global internet sensation and performed at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\n\nBut one of the group, Priscilla Zawedde, 13, told the BBC that winning the TV show - and the \u00a3250,000 ($313,000) prize money - would mean \"a bigger house for everyone\".\n\nSome 30 children currently share a five-bedroom house in Kampala, where they are looked after by Kavuma.\n\nHe set up the Inspire Ghetto Kids Foundation in 2007 to care for street children in the Kampala neighbourhood of Makindye and told the AFP news agency that having a bigger house would be a \"dream\" as the children would have more space.\n\nThey currently rely on donations from well-wishers, earnings from their social media posts as well as fees for live performances.\n\nKavuma also started life on the street before he was given a chance by a man who spotted him playing football and asked him if he wanted to go to school.\n\n\"He let me join his team and helped me pay my school fees. He was someone who helped me without knowing me. So from that day, I promised myself that when I grow up I'd hope to help a child one day,\" Kavuma told the BBC.\n\nBut he then switched to music, which he is now using to transform the lives of others.\n\n\"Most people thought street kids... have no value in society but I thought otherwise,\" he told AFP.\n\n\"I thought: 'What if I use music, dance and drama to transform the underprivileged in the ghettos?'\" he says.\n\nAkram Muyana, 13, told the BBC that dancing had always been his way of escaping reality after his father died.\n\n\"Whenever I dance, I feel so happy, and my stress goes away. I started going to churches to dance to get money to give my mother for her to buy me clothes and food.\"\n\nThis is the second generation of Kavuma's Ghetto Kids to have found global stardom - the first generation was discovered dancing to Ugandan singer Eddy Kenzo's \"Sitya Loss\" and went on to have millions of YouTube views.", "Silvio Berlusconi recorded his message from his hospital room following a serious illness\n\nItaly's former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi has told supporters he's ready to go back to work after a month in hospital.\n\nThe 86-year-old, who is suffering from leukaemia, was rushed into intensive care with a related lung infection but his condition has since stabilised.\n\nThere has been no word on when he might leave hospital.\n\nIn a video address from his room, Mr Berlusconi thanked his Forza Italia party members for their support.\n\n\"I never stopped, not even in the past few weeks,\" he said in the pre-recorded message, in which he appeared smartly dressed in a suit.\n\n\"I worked on the party's new structure and I'm ready to return to work with you and fight alongside you our fights for freedom.\"\n\nParty members clapped enthusiastically at the end of the speech and some could be seen holding back tears.\n\nThe message was filmed on Friday after relatives and doctors stopped the billionaire media tycoon from being discharged out of concern he would try to attend the party's two-day convention in Milan, according to the Italian newspaper La Repubblica.\n\nHe spent two weeks in intensive care before being moved to a general ward in mid-April.\n\nForza Italia was founded by Mr Berlusconi and he remains its leader after serving four terms as president. The party is a junior member of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's coalition government but has been in decline in recent years.\n\nMr Berlusconi's latter years in power were overshadowed by sex and corruption scandals and he remains a divisive figure in Italian politics.\n\nEarlier this year, he was finally cleared of bribing young showgirls to lie about his notoriously raunchy \"bunga bunga\" parties.\n\nMr Berlusconi was elected to Italy's upper house, the Senate, last September but has repeatedly required hospital treatment and is rarely seen in public.\n\nHis recent return to hospital caused concern in Italy and politicians from across the spectrum have wished him well.", "Sir Keir Starmer met with new local Labour leaders on Tuesday to discuss his party's plans\n\nSir Keir Starmer has asked Labour councillors to focus on easing living costs to capitalise on the party's local election results last week.\n\nThe Labour leader credited a \"single focus\" on the issue during the campaign for its strong showing, where it gained more than 500 councillors.\n\nThe result, he added, gave new local Labour leaders a \"duty to deliver\".\n\nMeanwhile, Rishi Sunak has insisted his five priorities remain the best way for the Tories to win back voters.\n\nThe prime minister is facing pressure to explain how he will improve the Conservatives' standing with voters ahead of the next general election, expected next year, after losing more than 1,000 councillors.\n\nLabour won control of 22 councils last week, after running a campaign focused on increased costs for households amid soaring inflation.\n\nThese new Labour local authorities have now been tasked with drawing up \"action plans\" to lower living costs within the next 100 days.\n\nAt a meeting with new Labour council leaders earlier, Sir Keir said he was \"absolutely convinced\" the issue was behind his party's gains, adding it had consistently come up on the doorstep during the campaign.\n\nAlthough councils have limited powers to change the economic forces behind rising prices, he said the plans could provide a \"blueprint\" for how his party could tackle the issue if it wins power nationally.\n\nIdeas raised by local leaders at the meeting included \"financial MOTs\" to help people claim the maximum amount of tax credit, and acting as a co-ordinator for local groups offering support.\n\nIn a possible hint of the party's focus ahead of the next election, the councils have also been tasked with reviewing local housing and development policies.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Sunak has insisted that his promises to cut inflation, bring down NHS waiting lists and tackle small boats, are the best way to put his party back on track after the local election losses.\n\nSome Conservative MPs have privately suggested Mr Sunak is likely to need to go beyond reiterating his five priorities - outlined earlier this year - to improve the Tories' fortunes.\n\nBut he doubled down on Tuesday, telling reporters during a visit that his priorities were \"the right ones\" to win back voters and \"the country's priorities\".\n\n\"I know that's not going to happen overnight, but what I can tell people is we are working day and night to make their lives better,\" he added.\n\nConservative MP Justin Tomlinson said the results were \"devastating\" for his party, and should serve as a \"wake-up call for the party at all levels\".\n\nSpeaking to Times Radio, he criticised the party's pitch to voters, adding it lacked a \"coherent message\" and it felt like it had \"forgotten\" to launch its campaign.\n\n\"Before we know it, we'll be heading into the general election, and we need to be back on the front foot,\" he added.\n\n\"We actually need to show that determination and that fight, and set out those tangible reasons why people should vote for what would be an unprecedented fifth term in office.\"", "A number of workers at the RNLI have raised some concerns about sexist and bigoted behaviour at the organisation.\n\nInternal surveys from 2021 and 2022 on the attitudes of staff and volunteers working at the UK lifeboat charity cite sexism and bullying.\n\nThe documents, first reported by the Times, have been seen by the BBC.\n\nThe RNLI told the BBC it was sorry to anyone who had faced \"behaviours and actions that no one should have to tolerate\" and \"will act\".\n\nThe organisation, which has more than 30,000 staff and volunteers, had about 3,600 survey responses over two years, mostly positive comments.\n\nBut the survey results show concerns also included \"blame\" culture, misogyny, being overworked, and a lack of space to openly call out inappropriate behaviour.\n\nIn the 2022 survey, one female respondent recounts being \"repeatedly\" called sexist terms by male colleagues.\n\n\"I have not once felt like the RNLI supports women or minorities,\" she said, adding that she would not recommend it \"as an employer to anybody\".\n\nA comment in the previous year's survey described the level of sexism at RNLI stations and around the coast as \"abhorrent\".\n\n\"I have never been at a station/around a branch and not heard an inappropriate comment or joke regarding race, sex or sexual orientation\".\n\nMatters reported to senior members were \"not dealt with effectively and timely,\" the person said, leading to some individuals getting away with \"disgraceful behaviour\".\n\nA respondent to the 2022 survey said their mental health has been affected by many factors, including a lack of holding people to account, being overworked and \"awful misogyny\".\n\nBullying was mentioned in a number of survey responses. There were no specific examples given but a respondent to the 2022 poll talked about experiencing a \"culture of bullying and harassment\".\n\nBut colleagues were praised for being \"caring\" by many survey respondents, and one comment says the RNLI is \"very inclusive of everyone and the relationships in the team make it a great place to work\".\n\nThe RNLI's Code of Conduct says volunteers must not \"participate in any form of inappropriate behaviour or activity\", including bullying, harassment or unlawful discrimination.\n\nSue Barnes, RNLI's People Director, said: \"We are sorry to our volunteers and staff who have faced behaviours and actions that no one should have to tolerate.\n\n\"There is no place for misogynistic, sexist, and non-inclusive behaviours at the RNLI and we are committed to taking action and tackling such behaviour.\"\n\nShe added that it has a \"range of methods\" members can use to report unacceptable behaviour, including a whistleblowing reporting line.\n\n\"We know we have more work to do to ensure we become the truly inclusive lifesaving charity we strive to be,\" she said.\n\nHave you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

Many of them shed light on some of Washington's global preoccupations.\n\nLike the spread and purpose of Chinese technology.\n\nThe documents appear to have been printed out and folded before being photographed and posted online\n\nThree documents based on intelligence from late February detail discussions among senior Jordanian officials over whether or not to shut the Chinese firm Huawei out of its 5G rollout plans.\n\nJordan's Crown Prince Hussein, in charge of the rollout, is said in the document to be worried about retaliation from China if they keep Huawei out.\n\nNor is this the only place where fears about Chinese technology are revealed\n\nAnother document marked top secret addresses China's \"developing cyber-attack capabilities.\" It says these are designed \"to deny, exploit, and hijack satellite links and networks as part of its strategy to control information, which it considers to be a key warfighting domain.\"\n\nNewly discovered documents suggest Russian officials are at loggerheads over the reporting of casualties.\n\nThe main intelligence agency, the FSB, has \"accused\" the country's defence ministry of playing down the human impact of the war, the files show.\n\nThese findings show the extent to which the US agencies have penetrated the Russian intelligence and military.\n\nOne document, dated 23 March, refers to the presence of a small number of Western special forces operating inside Ukraine, without specifying their activities or location. The UK has the largest contingent (50), followed by Latvia (17), France (15), the US (14) and the Netherlands (1).\n\nWestern governments typically refrain from commenting on such sensitive matters, but this detail is likely to be seized upon by Moscow, which has in recent months argued that it is not just confronting Ukraine, but Nato as well.\n\nOther documents say when a dozen new Ukrainian brigades - being prepared for an offensive that could begin within weeks - will be ready. They list, in great detail, the tanks, armoured vehicles and artillery pieces that are being provided by Ukraine's Western allies.\n\nOne map includes a timeline that assesses ground conditions across eastern Ukraine as spring progresses.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post newspaper, one document from early February expresses misgivings about Ukraine's chances of success in its forthcoming counteroffensive, saying that problems with generating and sustaining sufficient forces could result in \"modest territorial gains\".\n\nUkraine's difficulties in maintaining its vital air defences are also analysed, with warnings from late February that Kyiv might run out of critical missiles.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

In January, Reuters reported that Russia's share of Egyptian wheat imports had risen in 2022, offering one possible explanation.\n\nThere is no indication that Egypt - a recipient of US security assistance, worth around $1bn a year - went ahead with the proposed sale to Russia.\n\nAn unnamed official quoted on Egyptian news channels described the allegation as \"utterly baseless\" and said Cairo did not take sides in the war.\n\nThe Kremlin called it \"just another canard\" and the White House said there was \"no indication\" Egypt was providing lethal weapons to Russia.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Expert: US and Egypt ready to move forward after leak\n\nA classified document, seen by the BBC, reveals that South Korea was torn about selling weapons for use in Ukraine.\n\nThe report, based on signals intelligence, details a sensitive conversation between national security advisers.\n\nThey are torn between US pressure to send ammunition to Ukraine and their policy not to arm countries at war.\n\nOne of the advisers suggests sending the shells to Poland instead, to avoid appearing to have given in to the US.\n\nAs part of a resupply deal last year, Seoul insisted that the US could not pass the shells on to Ukraine. Seoul has been reluctant to arm Ukraine, for fear of antagonising Russia.\n\nThe leak has triggered security concerns in Seoul, with opposition politicians questioning how the US was able to intercept such a high-level conversation.\n\nThe Post also found that Beijing tested one of its experimental missiles - the DF-27 hypersonic glide vehicle - on 25 February.\n\nThe missile flew for 12 minutes over a distance of 2,100km (1,300 miles), according to the documents.", "Have you ever seen a \"snow tornado\"?\n\nMichael Peterson was feeding his sheep on his croft in Shetland when he spotted the rare weather event following a hailstorm on Tuesday.\n\nHe told BBC Radio Shetland he was lucky to be in the \"right place at the right time\".\n\nAn Arctic blast continues to hit many parts of Scotland, with school closures in Shetland, Aberdeenshire and Highland.", "We're drawing our live page to a close, but before we go let's take a look again at some of George Alagiah's most memorable moments on our screens:\n\nTributes have been pouring in from his colleagues at the BBC, friends elsewhere, and members of the public after a statement from his agent said he \"died peacefully today, surrounded by his family and loved ones\".\n\nThe BBC's director general Tim Davie has described Alagiah as \"one of the best and bravest journalists of his generation\".\n\nToday's page has been edited by me and James FitzGerald and written by Emily Atkinson, Jacqueline Howard and Sam Hancock.", "Rick Slayman (seated) pictured with his partner and team of doctors\n\nThe first man to receive a genetically modified kidney transplant from a pig has been discharged from hospital.\n\nThe 62-year-old was sent home on Wednesday, two weeks after the ground-breaking surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH).\n\nOrgan transplants from genetically modified pigs have failed in the past.\n\nBut the success of this procedure so far has been hailed by scientists as a historic milestone in the field of transplantation.\n\nThe news was shared in a press release on Wednesday by MGH, which is Harvard Medical School's largest teaching hospital in the US city of Boston.\n\nIn the release, the hospital said the patient, Richard \"Rick\" Slayman of Weymouth, Massachusetts, had been battling end-stage kidney disease and required an organ transplant.\n\nHis doctors successfully transplanted a genetically-edited pig kidney into his body over a four-hour-long surgery on 16 March.\n\nThey said Mr Slayman's kidney is now functioning well and he is no longer on dialysis.\n\nIn a statement, Mr Slayman said being able to leave hospital and go home was \"one of the happiest moments\" of his life.\n\n\"I'm excited to resume spending time with my family, friends, and loved ones free from the burden of dialysis that has affected my quality of life for many years.\"\n\nIn 2018, he had a human kidney transplant from a deceased donor, however it began to fail last year, and doctors raised the idea of a pig kidney transplant.\n\n\"I saw it not only as a way to help me, but a way to provide hope for the thousands of people who need a transplant to survive,\" he said.\n\nThe new pig kidney he received was modified by Cambridge-based pharmaceutical company eGenesis to remove \"harmful pig genes and add certain human genes to improve its compatibility with humans,\" it said.\n\nFor the procedure, the hospital said it drew from its history as being behind the world's first successful human organ transplant - a kidney - in 1954, as well as research it had conducted with eGenesis on xenotransplantation (interspecies organ transplants) over the past five years.\n\nThe pig kidney was genetically modified to make it more compatible with the human body\n\nThe procedure was greenlit by the Food and Drug Administration, who offered a single Expanded Access Protocol - also known as compassionate use - that is used for patients with life-threatening illnesses to grant them access to experimental treatment.\n\nThe team behind the transplant hailed it as a historic step that can provide a potential solution to the world's organ shortage, especially to those from ethnic minority communities whom the shortage disproportionately affects.\n\n\"An abundant supply of organs resulting from this technological advance may go far to finally achieve health equity and offer the best solution to kidney failure - a well-functioning kidney - to all patients in need,\" said Winfred Williams, Mr Slayman's doctor at MGH.\n\nAccording to data by US non-profit United Network for Organ Sharing, more than 100,000 Americans need a lifesaving organ transplant.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of donors - deceased and living - in 2023 was just under 23,500.\n\nIt is estimated that 17 people die each day in the US while waiting for an organ, and kidneys are the most common organ needed for a transplant.\n\nWhile this is the first pig kidney transplanted into a human, it is not the first pig organ to be used in an transplant procedure.\n\nTwo other patients have received pig heart transplants, but those procedures were unsuccessful as the recipients had died a few weeks later.\n\nIn one case, there were signs that the patient's immune system had rejected the organ, which is a common risk in transplants.", "Politicians and not civil servants should make any \"exceptionally difficult decisions\" on Stormont's public finances, a union representing senior civil servants has said.\n\nPermanent secretaries have been running Stormont departments since October due to the political stalemate at Stormont.\n\nThe FDA told the NI secretary they are tasked with \"exceptionally difficult decisions\" related to the budget.\n\nIt added that any cuts should fall on an \"accountable, active politician\".\n\nA Northern Ireland Office (NIO) spokesperson said restoring the Executive was \"the most immediate way of delivering local governance and prosperity\".\n\n\"The UK government's priority remains to see restored devolved institutions in place to take the decisions and action needed to address the challenges facing Northern Ireland at this time,\" they added.\n\nThe Stormont Executive is not functioning due to a boycott by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which is opposed to Northern Ireland's post-Brexit trading arrangements.\n\nHowever, with none of the nine government department ministers in place, the powers of civil servants are severely limited.\n\nThey can only implement policies previously agreed by politicians and their ability to react to changing circumstances is negligible.\n\nLast month, BBC News NI reported that Stormont officials were planning for budget cuts of at least \u00a3500m in cash terms.\n\nIn a letter, first reported by the Belfast Telegraph, FDA general secretary Dave Penman said no civil servant had accepted their post with the intention of taking decisions \"ought properly to be taken by democratically-elected ministers\".\n\n\"The FDA is aware, from the statements you and local parties in Northern Ireland have made in recent days, that you expect to set an exceptionally challenging budget for Northern Ireland by the end of this week.\n\n\"FDA members who are accounting officers, and those who support them, are being tasked by you to implement this challenging budget, requiring exceptionally difficult decisions to be taken which fall far outside the scope of what should be decided by officials operating without the direction and control of a minister.\"\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

It's very much not over - unlike the dispute with Network Rail, which saw signallers and maintenance staff accept a deal in March.\n\nThe dispute with the train operators always looked harder to resolve than Network Rail, because of the changes to working conditions involved - the strings attached, from the unions' perspective.\n\nThere's more misery for passengers on the way - hitting confidence in railway travel again - and workers will lose more pay.\n\nTrain companies' separate dispute with the train drivers' union Aslef has never looked close to a resolution, and today it announced three more strike dates.\n\nBut today's announcement from the RMT was a surprise, and makes it hard to see how their dispute goes from here.\n\nThe RMT's strikes have less impact than they did when Network Rail was involved too. But right now, it looks like there's still plenty of disruption ahead.\n\nThe government has a significant role - it holds the purse strings. It has shown no sign recently of being prepared to allow the train companies to put more money on the table.\n\nThe last rail strike on 18 March meant only 40% to 50% of trains could run as workers across 14 train operators walked out.\n\nThe ongoing dispute has affected services since June last year.\n\nHow are you affected by the latest round of rail strikes?

He denies wrongdoing.\n\nExtra security measures are in place with the authorities expecting protests outside the Manhattan court on Tuesday.\n\nMr Trump, 76, is the first ex-US president to face a criminal case.\n\n\"WITCH HUNT,\" the Republican wrote on his Truth Social platform shortly before travelling from his home in Florida to New York on Monday - a journey which drew blanket coverage across the US news channels.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, dozens of police and court officers, as well as Secret Service agents, are expected to escort Mr Trump through the streets of New York to the Lower Manhattan court complex.\n\nThe charges he faces will be disclosed in full at the hearing, which is scheduled for about 14:15 local time (19:15 BST). His lawyers have already said he will plead not guilty.\n\nThe former president is expected first to surrender at the office of Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg.\n\nOnce Mr Trump is fingerprinted and processed by officials, he is considered under arrest and in custody. He will then be arraigned in court - meaning the charges will be read out and he will plead.\n\nMr Trump has been under investigation over a $130,000 (\u00a3105,000) wire transfer by his former attorney, Michael Cohen, to adult film star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 presidential election.\n\nHush money agreements are not illegal, but the Manhattan prosecutor has been investigating whether business records were falsified in relation to the payment.\n\nMr Trump faces at least one felony charge in the case, according to US media. Other reports suggest there are about 30 counts in his indictment.\n\nMedia outlets lobbied Judge Juan Merchan to allow cameras inside the court, a motion that was opposed by Mr Trump's legal team because they said it would \"create a circus-like atmosphere at the arraignment\".\n\nBut on Monday night, Judge Merchan ruled that some press photographers will be allowed to take pictures for several minutes before the arraignment formally starts.\n\nThe former president is expected to be released on bail and to return to his Florida home Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday evening, where he plans to deliver remarks at 20:15 local time.\n\nHis trip on Monday lunchtime from Palm Beach to Manhattan was closely watched by millions.\n\nLive trackers followed his plane - painted in red, white and blue with \"Trump\" in big letters on the side - throughout the nearly four-hour flight from West Palm Beach to LaGuardia Airport in Queens.\n\nAnticipating his arrival, the intersection around Trump Tower - the former president's Manhattan residence - was thronged with New Yorkers and tourists alike.\n\nDozens of media crews had set up camp on every available corner while at least five news helicopters hovered high over Fifth Avenue.\n\nMr Trump waved at media and the crowd before walking in to the skyscraper under tight security, just after 16:15 local time (20:15 GMT).\n\nHe is understood to have spent Monday evening at Trump Tower consulting with legal advisers, a team that grew with the addition of Todd Blanche, a white-collar criminal defence lawyer and ex-federal prosecutor who previously represented onetime Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.\n\nMr Trump's 2024 White House campaign has raised over $8m since news of the charges against him broke last week, according to his team.\n\nAt a news conference on Monday, New York City Mayor Eric Adams warned any potential \"rabble-rousers\" to \"control yourselves\".\n\nGeorgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene plans to hold a pro-Trump rally near the court on Tuesday.\n\nUnlike the days preceding the Capitol riot in 2021 by Trump supporters, New York officials say they have not seen any influx of protesters to the city in recent days.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, at an event in the state of Minnesota on Monday, told reporters he had no concerns about unrest in New York, saying: \"I have faith in the New York Police Department.\"\n\nWith additional reporting from Kayla Epstein in New York\n\nDo you have questions about Donald Trump's court hearing?\n\nIn some cases your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

Refugees and activists tell the BBC intimidating tactics are tearing communities apart.\n\n\"My dearest son,\" said Alim's mother as she flickered into view. \"I didn't think I'd see you before I died.\"\n\nAlim - not his real name - says he was overcome by the moment. The reunion over a video call was their first contact in six years, since he fled as a refugee to the UK.\n\nBut it was bittersweet: someone else was in control of the call. Like all Uyghurs - a mostly Muslim minority from north-western China - Alim's mother lives under intense surveillance and control. They could never call each other directly.\n\nInstead, a middleman phoned Alim and his mother from two separate mobiles. He held the phone screens to face each other, so the pair could see wobbly images of each other - and hear muffled sound from the speakers.\n\nAlim says they barely spoke, and spent most of the call in tears.\n\nHe doesn't know if the plain white wall he could see behind his mother was in her house in Xinjiang or an internment camp, where the Chinese government is alleged to have detained more than a million Uyghurs. China has long denied those charges.\n\nBut Alim says he knew this contact with his mother would come at a cost - because the man brokering the call was a Chinese police officer.\n\nUyghurs in China live under intense surveillance and more than a million have allegedly been detained in internment camps (file photo from 2019)\n\nWhen the officer called again, he asked Alim to attend meetings of Uyghur human rights activists, gather intelligence and pass it back to the Chinese state.\n\n\"Whenever there was an anti-China protest in London, they would call me and ask who would be attending,\" says Alim, who shared with the BBC recordings of the phone calls requesting he work as a spy.\n\nAlim was offered money, too, so he could try to befriend the leaders of campaign groups - many of them UK citizens - by taking them to restaurants and picking up the bill.\n\nThe officer suggested setting up a company as a front, in case suspicions were raised about his newfound wealth. Plenty of businesses had already been set up on behalf of others for that exact purpose, Alim was told.\n\nThe implied threat, that his family may come to harm if he refused, has left him in a vicious bind.\n\n\"They are using my family as hostages,\" Alim says. \"I am living in a dark moment.\"\n\nWatch more on BBC Newsnight on BBC Two at 22:30 on Monday 31 July, or catch up afterwards on BBC iPlayer\n\nThe tactics employed by governments to police their diasporas abroad are known as transnational repression.\n\nResearch suggests this particular kind - controlling access to family members in the home country through video calls, in exchange for compliance overseas - is commonly used by Chinese police.\n\nDr David Tobin at the University of Sheffield has conducted some of the most comprehensive research on the topic to date, with his colleague Nyrola Elim\u00e4. They have interviewed and surveyed more than 200 members of the Uyghur diaspora in several countries. He says all Uyghurs living outside China are victims of transnational repression.\n\n\"Family separation is the central tactic,\" he says. Even where phone calls are technically possible, relatives still living in China won't pick up, according to Dr Tobin. He says there is an assumption that calls will be monitored, and a fear that communicating freely will put them at risk.\n\nDr David Tobin says all Uyghurs living abroad are victims of transnational repression\n\nThis severing of family ties allows Chinese police to step in and offer tightly managed access - over video calls - as an incentive to comply, with the threat of repercussions for the family if they do not.\n\nIn the UK, Dr Tobin surveyed or interviewed 48 Uyghurs, from a population of about 400 people. Of those, two-thirds reported having been contacted directly by Chinese police - and pressured to spy, refrain from advocacy work, or stop speaking to the media.\n\nAnd Uyghurs in the UK are far from the worst affected.\n\nIn Turkey, traditionally a safe haven for Uyghurs where 50,000 live in one of the largest communities outside China, 80% of the 148 of respondents reported similar threats from Chinese authorities.\n\nAbdurehim Para\u00e7 arrived in Istanbul in 2014, having fled China a year earlier.\n\n\"Turkey was completely different to anything we'd experienced. We could travel wherever we wanted. The police didn't bother us,\" he says. \"I couldn't believe such a life was possible.\"\n\nBut in the past few years, the picture has changed for Uyghurs in Turkey. Reports that police based in China have pressured people to spy on each other have filtered through the community, splintering their sense of camaraderie.\n\nAbdurehim Para\u00e7 says Turkey was a safe haven for Uyghurs, but China's tactics are driving the community apart\n\nIn a video posted on Facebook, a young Uyghur man who appears to have been captured and beaten by his peers, offers a troubled confession - admitting to spying on behalf of Beijing. While the circumstances surrounding the scene are unclear, the footage has been circulated among the Uyghur community, and the man has been widely condemned online.\n\nThe accumulation of stories like these is having an effect, Abdurehim says.\n\n\"Young people are distancing themselves from Uyghur protests and meetings. They are worried that people there might be spies,\" he says. \"China's plan is working.\"\n\nDr Tobin thinks Turkish authorities are aware of what's happening and have been slow to respond. \"The more dependent a country is on investment from China, the more likely it is to cooperate or to turn a blind eye,\" he says.\n\nTurkey is seen as having grown closer to China in recent years, and questions have been raised about its commitment to protecting its Uyghur community.\n\nThe Turkish government did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nBut China is not only targeting people in countries where it has economic supremacy.\n\nJulie Millsap, a US-born activist who works with the Uyghur Human Rights Project in Washington DC, says China has tried to pressure her through her in-laws.\n\nJulie Millsap, a US-born activist, says her husband's family in China faced police harassment for her work with Uyghurs\n\nHer husband is Han Chinese, part of the country's largest ethnic group, and the two met in China before moving to the US capital in 2020.\n\nAfter Julie began campaigning on behalf of Uyghurs, local police began dropping in on her extended family in China, saying they \"wanted to be friends\".\n\nShe and her husband received threatening messages from her sister-in-law's phone, suggesting Julie's children may end up \"as orphans\". \"They weren't written in a language style that she used,\" says Julie, who suspects the police were instructing her to send them.\n\nDuring a recent video call between her husband, in Washington DC, and his sister, in China, the police happened to stop by, allowing Julie to record the moment, and confront one of the officers directly.\n\n\"He stammered and asked us not to misinterpret his intentions,\" she says. The officer told her police were arranging visits to all local families with US relatives, in light of the \"delicate\" relationship between the US and China.\n\nJulie Millsap confronted a police officer who dropped in on her sister-in-law in China\n\nJulie recognises that a white American and a Han Chinese family are afforded a degree of safety that Uyghurs are not. \"But we're still talking about police harassment, about threats, about a daily reality that is anything but good,\" she says.\n\nShe thinks it is alarming that Chinese authorities feel comfortable targeting foreign citizens and attempting to dictate their work.\n\nThe US government is beginning to address the problem formally.\n\nIn March, senators introduced the Transnational Repression Policy Act, listing a range of abuses including \"coercion by proxy\", which covers threats to family members overseas. If passed, the law would see the creation of a dedicated phone line to report threats, and prompt Congress to bring sanctions against perpetrators wherever possible.\n\nAbduweli Ayup, a Uyghur rights campaigner based in Norway, thinks the US legislation would be a step in the right direction, but that Western governments should go further. Each time a case is reported to the authorities, questions should be lodged directly with the Chinese government, requesting assurance that family members are safe, he says.\n\n\"We are your citizens, your neighbours and your taxpayers. Our governments should take some responsibility,\" says Mr Ayup.\n\nDr Tobin recognises the complications inherent in tackling the issue. \"Saying 'would you like to speak to your family?' isn't a crime. We know it's a threat. We know it breaks communities, and causes mental health problems and trauma, but it is not a crime on British soil,\" he says.\n\nThe UK Home Office says attempts to intimidate overseas critics are \"unacceptable\", that an internal review into transnational repression is underway, and all such incidents should be reported to law enforcement.\n\nIn a statement, the Chinese Embassy in London called the allegations of transnational repression \"totally groundless\". The Chinese government \"protects Uyghurs and their communication with overseas relatives in accordance with the law\", it said.\n\nAlim chose not to report his case to the police, but confessed his predicament to a group of Uyghur rights activists in London.\n\nOne of the group's leaders told us the requests were very common, and posed challenges to the integrity of the community - but insisted their advocacy work would continue. In their experience, almost all advances from Chinese police are rejected.\n\nAlim wrestled with the issue before reaching a decision. \"I realised that betraying others for the sake of my family would mean selling out my nation, and I couldn't do that.\n\n\"If that was the price I had to pay, so be it.\" He too refused China's offer.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Conservation efforts have seen the number of red squirrels on Anglesey go from 40 to 1,000\n\nWales' red squirrels face being wiped out by a deadly virus unless a vaccine is developed, campaigners have warned.\n\nThe pox killed up to 80% of red squirrels over winter at one of just three sites where they can still be found in Wales.\n\nNearly 11,000 people have signed a petition calling on the Welsh government to fund vaccine research.\n\nThe Welsh government said it would look at \"emerging evidence and opportunities to best support populations\".\n\nInvasive, non-native grey squirrels carry squirrel pox virus, but are not affected by it.\n\nDr Craig Shuttleworth, an honorary research fellow at Bangor University, said there were only about 1,000 red squirrels left in north Wales, mostly on Anglesey.\n\nThere are tiny populations at Treborth, near Bangor, and in the Clocaenog forestry near Ruthin, Denbighshire.\n\nThere is also a project to restore the squirrels to Ceredigion, but the numbers remain small.\n\n\"We've got 1,000 and believe it or not, that's a conservation success,\" said Dr Shuttleworth.\n\n\"When we started on Anglesey we only had 40, now we've got about 800, potentially a few more. But they are under threat, a massive threat.\"\n\nThere has been a successful programme to cull all the grey squirrels on Anglesey, to protect the reds, but this has proved almost impossible to repeat on the mainland.\n\nDr Craig Shuttleworth says squirrel pox is the biggest threat facing native red squirrels in Wales\n\nIt led to the Treborth red squirrels almost being wiped out in November and December after coming into contact with grey squirrels carrying the pox virus.\n\nThe virus rapidly develops in the reds, causing cuts, blisters and growths on the skin. It is highly infectious and kills them in about three weeks.\n\nDr Shuttleworth said \"we don't need a grey squirrel to set foot on the island for pox to come here\" as reds moved between Anglesey and Gwynedd on the mainland.\n\nA red squirrel in Cumbria with lesions in his eyes and hands and that can barely eat - the virus is fatal to red squirrels\n\nHe is convinced a vaccine could help prevent further deaths and help rebuild the population across the UK.\n\nAccording to the Red Squirrels Northern England group, there are now only 290,000 squirrels left in the UK.\n\n\"We are asking the Welsh government to take the lead, to be daring and to start funding vaccine research again,\" said Dr Shuttleworth.\n\nA petition to the Senedd calling for the move has attracted 10,700 signatures, which means it will now be considered for a debate.\n\nWork on a vaccine was under way at Scotland's Moredun Institute until funding dried up in about 2010.\n\nDr Colin McInnes, who led the original research programme, said there was \"still quite a bit of work to be done\", including how it would be delivered and how much protection it offered.\n\nThose backing the vaccine bid believe it would be money worth spending, with Dr Shuttleworth estimating tourists coming to see the squirrels was already worth about \u00a31m a year.\n\n\"What about the wellbeing value?\" added Dr Shuttleworth.\n\nHugh Rowlands has been dubbed \"The Squirrel Whisperer\"\n\nOne person who knows more about this than perhaps any other is Hugh Rowlands, a retired Army veteran from Llangefni on Anglesey.\n\nHe has post-traumatic stress disorder after his time in the military and seeing the red squirrels at a nature spot has changed his life.\n\n\"It's very rewarding. It used to stop me getting in trouble with the law,\" he confessed.\n\n\"I come here maybe five times a week for hours on end and just sit with the squirrels and feed them.\n\n\"If a grey squirrel came in here and these squirrels disappeared, I would be absolutely devastated - there's no two ways about it.\"\n\nHugh has been able to capture scores of images of his beloved red squirrels\n\nHugh has now spent so much time in the area, the squirrels come out when they hear his voice, knowing food will follow.\n\nIt earned him the nickname \"The Squirrel Whisperer of the Dingle\" from the television wildlife expert Iolo Williams.\n\nBut he is sceptical: \"I think it's this Welsh accent of mine they hear, and I just talk and talk and they come down.\"\n\nResponding to the petition lodged with the Senedd, a Welsh government official said: \"We welcome the important work being carried out by people to protect this vulnerable species.\n\n\"We have seen some positive progress for increasing numbers of red squirrels in Wales but there is much more to do.\"", "Last updated on .From the section Man City\n\nManchester City have been crowned Premier League champions for the third successive season after title rivals Arsenal lost at Nottingham Forest.\n\nThe Gunners, top for the majority of the campaign, are four points behind City with only one game left to play after being beaten 1-0 on Saturday.\n\nPep Guardiola's side have won the title in five of the past six campaigns.\n\nThey also have a chance to claim the Treble, with FA Cup and Champions League finals to come next month.\n\nOnly Manchester United, in 1998-99, have previously achieved that feat - and it is their derby rivals whom City will meet at Wembley on 3 June, before facing Inter Milan a week later in Istanbul, where they will hunt a first Champions League triumph.\n\nCity will lift the trophy after they play Chelsea on Sunday (16:00 BST).\n\nCaptain Ilkay Gundogan - who has scored four goals in the past two league games - said: \"The Premier League is without doubt the most demanding and competitive league in the world, so that tells you everything about what an achievement this is.\n\n\"To have won this trophy three times in a row and five times in six years is incredible. That quality and consistency helps sum up what Manchester City stand for and ensures the club will continue to strive for success going forward.\n\n\"It has been a season I will never forget.\"\n\nCity, champions for a ninth time in the club's history, had trailed Arsenal by eight points on 7 April, although they had played one game fewer than Mikel Arteta's leaders at that point.\n\nIt is only the fourth time that a team has been as many as eight points clear after at least 28 Premier League games and failed to win the title.\n\nOnly one team has ever had 69 points with 10 games remaining - as Arsenal did - and failed to win the title. That was Liverpool in 2018-19, when they finished on 97 points, one behind City.\n\nBut City have won 11 league games in a row - and dropped just two points from a possible 42 - to overhaul Arsenal and clinch the title with three games remaining.\n\n\"Arsenal have pushed us right to the limit,\" said full-back Kyle Walker. \"They've been fantastic and full credit to them, but I think we just went on an incredible run, and we've managed to end up where we have now. They've had a few hiccups and we've managed to capitalise on that.\n\n\"It's the players we've got. We're a bunch of lads who have achieved so much over the last number of years and we understand the standards we've set.\"\n\u2022 None 'An unstoppable juggernaut' - where will Man City dominance end?\n\nCity are only the fifth club to win three successive top-flight titles in England, following Huddersfield Town (1924-26), Arsenal (1933-35), Liverpool (1982-84) and Manchester United, who did it twice under Sir Alex Ferguson (1999-2001 and 2007-09).\n\nIt is also the third occasion Guardiola has managed to win three league titles in a row, having done so in La Liga with Barcelona from 2009-11 and in the Bundesliga from 2014-16 with Bayern Munich.\n\nCity's Premier League dominance of five titles in six seasons was last achieved by Manchester United between 1996 and 2001 - a period where they also won the Treble of Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League.\n\nUnited also won seven titles in nine seasons between 1993-2001; as well as five titles in seven seasons between 2007-2013 - so City's current dominance is not unprecedented.\n\nBefore that, Liverpool in the late 1970s and early '80s enjoyed similar periods of league success.\n\nCity will complete their league campaign with away games against Brighton and Brentford, before resuming their Treble bid.\n\nTheir push for that achievement has been driven, in part, by Erling Haaland's remarkable goalscoring record since the forward joined from Borussia Dortmund last summer.\n\nThe 22-year-old Norwegian has scored 52 goals in 48 games in all competitions - including a record-breaking 36 goals in 33 Premier League appearances.\n\nHaaland is just the second player in English top-flight history to score more than 50 times in all competitions - and the first to do so for 95 years.\n\nHe broke the Premier League record for goals in a season with his 35th at the start of March, which moved him one clear of Andy Cole and Alan Shearer - whose 34-goal tallies had come in a 42-match campaign.\n\nThe title win comes three months after City were charged by the Premier League with more than 100 breaches of its financial rules following a four-year investigation. The charges cover the period of 2009-2018, since the 2008 takeover by the Abu Dhabi United Group, led by billionaire Sheikh Mansour, a member of the Abu Dhabi royal family.\n\nThey are accused of effectively falsifying their accounts and artificially inflating sponsorship and commercial deals over a number of years to allow them to spend more but stay within Uefa and Premier League rules.\n\nCity said they were \"surprised by the charges\" but welcomed the \"review of this matter by an independent commission to impartially consider\" their case, which City said was supported by a \"comprehensive body of irrefutable evidence\".\n\nCity, who have always denied financial wrongdoing, said they \"look forward to this matter being put to rest once and for all\".\n\nThe club has been referred to an independent commission, which can impose punishments ranging from a fine and points deduction to expulsion from the Premier League.

He moves from the Ministry of Defence, where he was in charge of procurement.\n\nHe represents Cheltenham in Gloucestershire, but had a majority of just 981 over the Liberal Democrat candidate at the last general election.\n\nAs justice secretary, he will be no stranger to legal matters. A trained barrister, he is a former solicitor general for England and Wales, and has been prisons and probations minister.\n\nHe has described his new job as \"a hugely important brief that upholds the values of our great country - the rule of law, justice for victims and the right to a fair trial\".\n\nMr Chalk is the 11th person appointed to the post since the Conservatives took power in 2010.\n\nWith a reputation for being sunny, affable and unfailingly polite, the new justice secretary is very different to his predecessor - or at least the character described in Adam Tolley KC's report.\n\nYou might say they're Chalk and cheese.\n\nThese appointments say something about the prime minister's confidence too.\n\nWhen he became prime minster last October, he made a point of keeping several former Liz Truss supporters in the cabinet - such as Therese Coffey, Sella Braverman and Alister Jack.\n\nSix months on and with the Tory party in parliament in a state of comparative calm, he has used this moment to reward the ranks of Team Sunak and to buttress his premiership with loyalists.\n\nDowning Street has also announced that Chloe Smith will cover as science secretary while Michelle Donelan is on maternity leave.\n\nMs Smith, who was work and pensions secretary under Liz Truss, is to stand down as MP for Norwich North at the next general election.\n\nJames Cartlidge has taken over from Mr Chalk as defence procurement minister, while his previous job as exchequer secretary has gone to Gareth Davies.", "President Raisi (pictured) is an ultra-conservative close to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei\n\nIran says Saudi Arabia has invited Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi for an official visit -

It's showing King Charles and Queen Camilla in the most formal trappings of royalty, wearing their robes and crowns, showing them taking their place in these historic roles.\n\nIt's the kind of official shot you'd see on the wall of a public building rather than in a family album.\n\nThe picture of Camilla is also making it clear that this is now Queen Camilla, no longer the Queen Consort.\n\nThe choice of who is in the group shot of the Royal Family is also symbolic. It says that the focus is limited to the \"working royals\", that core group who will carry out official duties on behalf of the King. It's not the extended family or any hangers-on, these are the royals we're going to see representing the new reign.", "More than 12% of physiotherapy positions are currently vacant in Northern Ireland\n\nTraining places at Ulster University for degree courses in physiotherapy and other health specialities are to be cut, BBC News NI understands.\n\nThe Chartered Society of Physiotherapy in NI said it was expecting training places to be reduced after a budget briefing from the Department of Health.\n\nThe society expressed extreme concern, saying more than 12% of physiotherapy positions are currently vacant.\n\nThe Department of Health said the move is part of its attempts to save money.\n\nIn a statement, the department said it was making decisions on spending reductions with \"great regret\".\n\nIt added that it is in the impossible position of \"having to fulfil conflicting responsibilities\".\n\nThe department said it was \"living within the budget, acting in the public interest and safeguarding services\".\n\nCivil servants have been tasked with running Stormont departments and managing public services in the absence of a devolved government, but they must stick to the budget published last month by Secretary of State Chris Heaton-Harris.\n\nThe Department of Health received the biggest allocation, but its budget of \u00a37.25bn was similar to the amount it got last year.\n\nThat has been viewed as a difficult settlement because of the high rate of inflation and outstanding pay disputes involving nurses and other health workers.\n\nThe Chartered Society of Physiotherapy in Northern Ireland said: \"The current political hiatus has created an intolerable situation for public services here and will add to the significant pressures already facing the health and social care system.\"\n\nIt added that although it did not yet have exact figures, it was \"extremely concerned\" by the anticipated cuts to number of physiotherapy undergraduate training places at Ulster University (UU).\n\nThe number of nursing training places is to be cut from September\n\n\"The health and social care service in Northern Ireland already has record numbers of workforce vacancies,\" the society said.\n\n\"Last year saw approximately 900 applications for roughly 100 training places for the physiotherapy course in [UU] Magee.\"\n\nOn Monday, the BBC revealed that the number of nursing training places is to be cut in September from 1,325 to 1,025.\n\nThe Royal College of Nursing's Northern Ireland director, Rita Devlin, described the move as an \"act of destruction\".\n\nThe department said it recognised the importance of staffing and was committed to 1,025 new nursing places.\n\nThis was the level in place before the New Decade, New Approach deal, which included provision for an extra 300 nurse training places each year to address staff shortages and concerns over safety.\n\nBut Ms Devlin said the news of cuts had left members \"bewildered\" with almost 3,000 vacant nursing posts in Northern Ireland.\n\n\"It is unimaginable that the Department of Health has been put in the position of having to cut the number of student nursing places for 2023-2024 because of the political and financial crisis in Northern Ireland,\" she explained.", "Shanshan and her Taiwanese boyfriend have found themselves caught up in strained relations of their governments (file image)\n\nShanshan had never met anyone from Taiwan before January last year.\n\nThe 24-year-old, from Changsha City in central China, had also not really paid much attention to news about the self-governing island, which her country believes is Chinese territory and has promised to take one day.\n\nBut then she fell in love - she met her Taiwanese boyfriend playing online video games. They started chatting for hours, long talks during which she discovered he was \"gentle and sensitive\".\n\nBut even as Shanshan and her partner Guodong share sweet messages across the Taiwan Strait - preparing to meet her parents during the Chinese New Year festival - their governments are trading a ramped-up war of words in the run-up to Taiwan's presidential elections on Saturday.\n\nChina's President Xi Jinping has cast the decision at Taiwan's ballot box as a choice between war and peace. Under his leadership, Beijing has taken an ever sharper, firmer and often more aggressive tone towards the democratically-governed island, warning the world that it alone will decide how and when unification will happen.\n\nHowever, despite regular military activities in the Taiwan Strait, President Xi has also repeatedly offered \"peaceful reunification\", while Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Office maintains that \"both sides of the Taiwan Strait are one family\".\n\nBut those most likely to listen to this message are its own people - not those living across the strait.\n\nTaiwan sits just 68 nautical miles away from China's Pingtan island - just visible through binoculars\n\nShanshan and Guodong have very different views on the future of Taiwan.\n\n\"My boyfriend just wants to maintain the status quo and doesn't want independence or unification. But I support our country's position and hope for unification one day. We only discuss, we don't argue. The key is that we can't change these things, so we hope for positive developments,\" she says.\n\nTheir differing views have not affected their relationship. And yet, the issue has created very real barriers for the couple.\n\nChina banned \"individual tourists\" from visiting Taiwan in 2019. That means Shanshan cannot visit her partner's home or his parents, and she wonders if that will ever change.\n\nBut things are not much easier for Guodong when he arrives in China.\n\nShanshan has discovered that she and her boyfriend may share the same language, and her government says they are the same people, but he faces the same hurdles as many foreigners hoping to settle in mainland China.\n\nThe administration and paperwork involved for either one of them to stay with the other for any length of time is substantial. Paying for most things involves the need to generate a QR code on pre-registered Chinese phones, with Chinese apps linked to Chinese bank accounts - none of which he has.\n\n\"For example, when he comes to visit, buying tickets, booking hotels, and making payments are challenging, and even going to tourist sites, taking taxis, or going to the bank, he faces difficulties,\" Shanshan explains.\n\n\"After being together, I realised that there are many cross-strait couples facing restrictions and difficulties in meeting each other, and the marriage process is complicated and tedious.\"\n\nChina's relationship with Taiwan is therefore critical for this couple. Closer ties could make it easier for them to move between countries. For them, politics across the strait is tangible.\n\nFor others in China, Taiwan is part of a vision - the government's view of the future. State media highlights the ties between the two as a shining beacon of brotherhood and shared cultural heritage.\n\nChinese tourists flock to this spot, embracing Beijing's vow to unify with Taiwan\n\nOn a rocky outcrop of Pingtan island in Fujian province, the closest part of the Chinese mainland to Taiwan, tourists pay to stand on a platform and peer through binoculars at an outline of Taiwan 68 nautical miles (126km) away.\n\nMany have travelled thousands of miles to get here. They brave the biting January winds and struggle to brace themselves against the gales as they stare out to sea over the rising white horses. Sea fog and cloud obscure any view of Taiwan, but still, they line up to take photographs at a strategically placed stone arch, using their arms to make love heart signs above their heads.\n\nFor some, this is a poignant moment.\n\nCui Xiuwen has come from northwest China's Shaanxi province in the hope of just a glimpse of Taiwan.\n\n\"My biggest wish after visiting here is that I hope the island of Taiwan can return to our motherland soon,\" the 61-year-old tells us excitedly.\n\n\"The urge and feeling became stronger while I've been here. In the past I didn't feel this so keenly. Our compatriots are watching each other across the water and we cannot unite.\"\n\nShe hugs our team warmly as she talks about her fear of conflict.\n\n\"We see and hear much talk about Taiwan and the mainland on TV. That's why I want to come here quickly and look at it. I hope Taiwan will be reclaimed in a peaceful way. I don't want war. The casualties will be huge. We want peace.\"\n\nOne young couple - dressed head to toe in Christian Dior - pose for their social media feeds in sunglasses while gazing wistfully out to sea.\n\nThey stand in stark contrast to some of those who live and work on this island, who admit to rarely thinking about their neighbour, just a few hours away by boat.\n\nBut Chinese citizens struggling to earn a living along the same coast rarely think about their neighbours\n\nDozens of local workers gather in groups on the concrete walls of the small port on the island to sort abalone shells for harvesting. Huddling together out of the wind, wrapped up in fleece headscarves and fishing overalls, they barely look up as they speak to us. They need to keep working to earn money - that is their main concern.\n\n\"I don't feel a connection. I have no friends or relatives there,\" says one woman as she uses her knife to scrape through the baskets to release the shellfish.\n\n\"I don't care whether it's reunified or not. We ordinary people don't care. This is up to the officials. We have no wish or hope. We just want enough to eat, we want a better life. We don't care about other things.\"\n\nRead more about the Taiwan election:\n\nThere are around 40 million people living in Fujian province. Many Taiwanese are thought to be descendants of Fujian immigrants, and Beijing often uses these ties as an argument for closer economic and social integration. It wants Fujian province to be the model for \"peaceful unification with the motherland\".\n\nIt's part of what analysts call a \"carrot and stick\" approach to Taiwan.\n\nOr more recently - a display of warships and wooing.\n\nChina has named its new aircraft carrier after Fujian. It unveiled new images of its first domestically designed warship on state television just last week - part of President Xi's goal of making the People's Liberation Army a \"world class military\".\n\nBut alongside these flashy displays of military power, there is some evidence that Beijing is attempting to entice more Taiwanese people to the mainland.\n\nThe Chinese government has unveiled a detailed plan this week to try to bring more Taiwanese investors to Fujian and to encourage Taiwan residents to study, work and live in the south-eastern province.\n\nOne block of flats in Fuzhou, the BBC found, was even going as far as to offer incredibly cheap rent to Taiwanese people. \"Welcome home\" said the sign on the front door, but when we spoke to a real estate agent they said that any such rental agreement needed permission from various government departments.\n\nChina also plans to build a high-speed railway across the strait \"at an early date\".\n\nThe simple fact is the two need each other, economically. China is Taiwan's biggest trading partner, and exports to China have enabled its economy to enjoy strong growth.\n\nBeijing is keen to encourage Taiwanese people to live and work in China\n\nIn an alleyway in Fuzhou, the main city in Fujian province, Li Haoyu from Taiwan tosses noodles into the sizzling wok as customers on mopeds wait for their dinner. He came to China seven years ago for a job at a funeral home. His path from there is a little vague, he's not even sure how old he is.\n\nHe hasn't been back for five years, but has to return soon as his travel permit to China will soon expire.\n\nTaiwanese noodles have a simpler flavour, he says as his swirls the hot pan over the fire.\n\nWorld headlines about war and business worries across the Taiwan Strait do not worry him. He is only concerned with the flow of customers in his street.\n\nBut he knows the relationship between his past and current homes are not good.\n\n\"I think the feelings are good between the people. But I don't know how the two governments feel about each other,\" he says as he carefully loads the noodles into a bowl.\n\n\"I hope ties can be normalized. I hope the two sides can be like two brothers, like a family,\" he adds.\n\nThe ties between Taiwan and China after this election could also have an impact on Shanshan's blossoming relationship.\n\nBeijing has already warned that any attempt to push for Taiwan's formal independence will mean conflict - although many doubt Beijing will want a war on its doorstep as it battles an economic downturn.\n\nAll Shanshan can do is \"hope for a better cross-strait relationship\".\n\nLuckily, their own relationship is going well, she adds.\n\n\"Despite the distance, we can be together.

Northern Ireland are still struggling to book an MoT despite a record number of tests being carried out in the last six months.\n\nThere has been a backlog since testing was suspended several times in 2020.\n\nThe Department for Infrastructure (DfI) said more than 500,000 tests were conducted in the last six months as part of efforts to cut delays.\n\nBut some drivers trying to book online still face long waits for an appointment.\n\nBetween September last year and the end of February 2023, a total of 506,967 full vehicle tests had been carried out by the Driver and Vehicle Agency (DVA), she added.\n\nThat is a 22% increase on the same period in 2021/2022.\n\n\"This increase in capacity has been achieved by adopting a range of measures including the recruitment of additional vehicle examiners, the use of overtime to provide cover for leave and by offering vehicle test appointments on a Sunday and bank holidays, when testing is not normally available,\" the DfI said.\n\n\"The DVA currently issues reminder notifications six weeks in advance of your MoT expiry date.\n\n\"The DVA will keep this notification period under review as it continues to manage the demand for vehicle testing.\"\n\nThey added that it did not currently hold information to enable it to accurately report the average waiting times for vehicle tests \"given that this position changes on a regular basis\".\n\nBBC News NI logged on to the booking system on Friday to check the current availability.\n\nThe soonest date some MoT centres are offering in Northern Ireland are in June and July\n\nIt appears many motorists are facing two or three-month delays for an MoT, unless a cancellation appears, when using the DVA online system.\n\nAn MoT certificate ensures a vehicle meets legal standards and is required for tax and insurance purposes.\n\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) previously said it would not penalise drivers whose MoT has expired as long as they met a number of criteria.\n\nThe PSNI told BBC News NI that exemption remains in place.\n\n\"In the event police encounter a vehicle with no current MoT, so long as we can ascertain that a vehicle is roadworthy, has a forthcoming MoT test date and is not sorned (statutory off road notification), then police will not take any further action,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nAs for insurers, the Association of British Insurers (ABI) said \"where motorists in Northern Ireland have a confirmed MoT appointment booking for their test, they should not be prejudiced by a lack of a valid MoT certificate if it has run out before the test takes place\".\n\nABI said its members had agreed to maintain cover for customers who, \"through no fault of their own\", could not get a test.\n\n\"However, motorists whose MoTs are due must keep trying to book a test with the DVA, even if the date falls after when their MoT certificate expires.\"\n\nThe spokesperson added that insurers must keep their vehicle in a roadworthy condition.\n\nDrivers requiring an MoT to tax their vehicle, who cannot get an appointment before their current certificate expires, are asked to \"book the earliest available appointment and keep checking the booking system for an earlier appointment\", according to the DfI.\n\n\"If they get to within five days of the expiry date of their vehicle tax and they have been unable to secure an appointment or their vehicle tax has expired, they should contact the DVA customer services team at dva.customerservices@infrastructure-ni.gov.uk and they will do their best to get an urgent appointment for the vehicle,\" a spokesperson added.\n\nMoT tests in Northern Ireland were first suspended in January 2020 due to safety concerns about equipment being used during the tests.\n\nThen Covid-19 hit, bringing another halt to MoT tests in March 2020.\n\nTesting resumed in stages from June 2020, at a reduced capacity due to social distancing measures, before returning fully in July 2021.\n\nA new online booking system was set up in September 2021 to deal with the backlog that built up from January 2020, but it initially faced technical problems and created further delays.", "Last updated on .From the section Championship\n\nVincent Kompany's Burnley secured promotion back to the Premier League at the first attempt with victory over fourth-placed Middlesbrough.\n\nThe Clarets, unbeaten in the league since November, took an early lead when Ashley Barnes redirected Josh Brownhill's low shot into the back of the net.\n\nThe home side equalised just after half-time when Championship top scorer Chuba Akpom scored from the spot after Josh Cullen felled Cameron Archer in the penalty area.\n\nConnor Roberts steered in the winner from Nathan Tella's near-post cross and Kompany's men saw out the rest of the game in comfort to spark wild celebrations on the pitch and among their travelling fans.\n\nVictory for the east Lancashire side sent them 19 points clear of third-placed Luton, who have six games left to play.\n\u2022 None Kompany says Burnley can 'go for more' after Premier League return\n\nKompany left Belgian top-flight side Anderlecht to take over at Turf Moor after they were relegated on the final day of last season, and the 36-year-old former Manchester City defender has enjoyed a near-flawless first campaign.\n\nDespite a massive turnaround of players in the summer following the end of their six-year spell in the Premier League they have become the first team in the English Football League to secure promotion in 2022-23, having been top of the table since 25 October.\n\nThe Lancashire side now need just 11 points from their final seven games to secure the title, while 13 will see them become the first Championship team to break the 100-point barrier since Leicester City in 2013-14.\n\nThe Clarets host second-placed Sheffield United, the last team to beat them in a league game 19 matches ago, on Monday.\n\nFor fourth-placed Middlesbrough this was a damaging second successive defeat and they are nine points adrift of the Blades, who have also played a game fewer.\n\nBurnley have now won promotion to the Premier League in each of their past three seasons in the second tier.\n\nHowever, this has looked very different to their previous successes under long-serving boss Sean Dyche, who, incidentally, was sacked on Good Friday last year.\n\nFrom the first game of the season, when they saw off Huddersfield in the Championship curtain-raiser back in July, it was apparent that they would be playing a far more possession-based game to the one employed by Dyche.\n\nThey suffered defeat at Watford in the third game of the campaign and had just six points from their first five matches, but the Kompany did not waiver and a 16-match unbeaten run sent them to the top of the league.\n\nA heavy 5-2 defeat at Sheffield United did not derail them, as they secured a 3-0 win over east Lancashire rivals Blackburn in their next game.\n\nThey picked up where they had left off after the break for the World Cup and they equalled a club record with a 10-game winning run that saw them open up a huge gap on the chasing pack.\n\nNo side has won promotion to the Premier League with seven games left since the second tier rebranded in 2004 - and Burnley will now look to secure the title, break the 100-point barrier and become the first team to go unbeaten at home in a Championship season since Newcastle United in 2009-10.\n\nGiven the amount of change that Kompany has overseen since taking charge it was somewhat ironic that it was a combination of two players who were there when he took over that gave them the lead.\n\nBrownhill's low strike from the edge of the area might have been going in anyway but 33-year-old Barnes, who has now won promotion to the Premier League three times with the club, stuck out a foot to redirect it and leave Boro keeper Zack Steffen with no chance.\n\nBarnes said after the game that he would be leaving the Clarets in the summer after nine years, saying it was \"the end of an era\" and it was \"time for him to move on\".\n\nTella missed a gilt-edged chance to double their lead before the break when he fired wide after being played in behind the home defence.\n\nAkpom's 27th goal of the season brought Michael Carrick's men back into it and they enjoyed a spell of dominance thereafter.\n\nHowever, they could not create another real chance of note and were opened up by a pass into the inside right channel that Tella latched on to, before putting it on a plate for former Boro loanee Roberts to score.\n\nAkpom had a chance in the last minute to delay the Burnley celebrations for a few days at least but he headed wide at the back post.\n\nThere was a sour note when Clarets midfielder Johann Berg Gudmundsson was struck by a coin thrown from the Middlesbrough end during the celebrations of the league leaders' second goal.\n\nSuccessive defeats for the Teessiders means they will almost certainly have to go through the play-offs if they are to join Burnley in the Premier League next season.\n\n\"Credit to them firstly, I have to say congratulations. I've been in the changing room and seen the players and the staff because I think they deserve a congratulations for what they've achieved.\n\n\"It hurts us to see them celebrating in our stadium but we totally respect the position that they are in and they deserve that.\n\n\"In terms of the game, hugely proud of the lads. I thought there was a real high level game in terms of intensity. I know there wasn't loads of chances but I think that shows how good we both were and how far we've come really.\n\n\"The boys are bitterly disappointed but at the same time I think they've taken a lot from it.\n\n\"We've gained confidence, belief, we're a better team now. We've lost two games on the bounce but for me it's not a big deal because we'll take a lot more from this game tonight than we'll lose.\"\n\n\"It's Easter and there's seven games to go and we're already celebrating. We didn't expect it.\n\n\"We wanted to experience this at some point but quicker is better sometimes as well.\n\n\"There's a couple of logical rules we all know, if you don't have squad cohesion at the beginning then it takes time.

A Defra source did not deny this but would only say the response would be published \"in due course\".\n\nThe consultation says the government expects councils to start implementing these new waste policies this year.\n\nThe proposals in the consultation would cost more than \u00a3465m per year for the first seven years of implementation, according to research by the District Councils' Network, a lobby group.\n\nThe government has said it would \"fully fund\" all new waste collection burdens on local authorities.\n\nGiven the pressure on council budgets, \"it is essential that the full implementation and running costs of any changes are reimbursed\", a spokesperson for the District Councils' Network said.\n\nThe spokesperson said they were concerned about the reforms and \"their potential to reduce local freedom to deliver services that work in the best way for our communities\".\n\nThose concerns were echoed by Sarah Nelmes, the leader of Three Rivers District Council in Hertfordshire.\n\nCouncil leader Sarah Nelmes fears the standardisation of waste management could be counterproductive\n\nThree Rivers says its residents currently recycle 63.5% of their waste and the council is consistently near the top of the league table for recycling in England.\n\n\"Our residents do the recycling, we just make it easy for them,\" Ms Nelmes said. \"If we change the rules, some people just won't bother. If I had to have another three boxes, would I recycle?\"\n\nShe said if the changes go ahead as planned, there may be \"hidden costs\" for councils and \"bottlenecks\" as they scramble to buy new bin lorries and expand depots.\n\n\"I'm concerned it will be chaos because everybody will be trying to do the same thing at the same time,\" she said.\n\n\"If every council in the country is having to buy different bins, that's not going to work great.\"\n\nFollowing the outcome of this consultation, Environment Secretary Therese Coffey will specify the types of materials to be collected within each recyclable waste stream, in new regulations.\n\nCharlotte Paine, who leads South Holland District Council's operational services, said collecting recyclable materials separately was appealing, in principle.\n\n\"But trying to say that has to be done in a particular way just will not work given the complexities of different areas,\" she said.\n\n\"Much depends on where your waste goes, your local recycling facility, and how well they can deal with that.

And I'm not sure they'll achieve the environmental outcomes they're looking for.\"\n\nA Defra spokesperson said the reforms to waste management would \"make recycling easier and ensure that there is a comprehensive, consistent service across England\".\n\n\"This will help increase recycled material in the products we buy and boost a growing UK recycling industry,\" the spokesperson said. \"We have held a public consultation on the proposed changes and will announce further details shortly.\"", "The stars have genuinely collaborated on previous songs including The Ride and Live For\n\nA song that uses Artificial Intelligence to clone the voices of Drake and The Weeknd has gone viral on social media.\n\nCalled Heart On My Sleeve, the track simulates the two stars trading verses about pop star and actress Selena Gomez, who previously dated The Weeknd.\n\nThe creator, known as @ghostwriter, claims the song was created by software trained on the musician's voices.\n\n\"This is just the beginning,\" they wrote under the song's YouTube video.\n\n\"We really are in a new era,\" responded one listener in the comments. \"Can't even tell what's legit or fake anymore.\"\n\n\"This is the 1st example of AI-generated music that really wowed me,\" added Mckay Wrigley, an AI developer, on Twitter.\n\nSince it was posted on Friday, the song has been viewed more than 8.5 million times on TikTok. The full version has also been played 254,000 times on Spotify.\n\nIt opens with a repetitive piano figure that transitions into a booming bass beat, as the AI Drake raps: \"I came in with my ex like Selena to flex/ Bumpin' Justin Bieber the fever ain't left.\"\n\nThe fake Weeknd responds with a verse where he \"alleges\" Gomez cheated on him before their break-up in 2017.\n\nThe track even includes a call-out to producer Metro Boomin', who has worked with artists such as 21 Savage, Future, Nicki Minaj and Kanye West.\n\nIt's not perfect. The song has the scratchy, low quality vibe of a bootlegged demo; and the vocals are sometimes slurred and glitchy - likely to be artefacts of the AI process.\n\nNeither artist has responded to the song yet, but Drake recently expressed displeasure at his voice being cloned.\n\n\"This is the final straw AI,\" he posted on Instagram, after stumbling across a fan-made video in which he appeared to be rapping the Ice Spice track Munch (Feeling U).\n\nDrake's complaint came after Universal Music Group wrote to streaming services including Spotify and Apple Music, asking them to prevent artificial intelligence companies from accessing their libraries.\n\nIt is thought companies have been using the music to \"train\" their software.\n\n\"We will not hesitate to take steps to protect our rights and those of our artists,\" UMG warned in the email, first obtained by the Financial Times.\n\nSeveral websites already offer fans the ability to create new songs using soundalike voices of pop's biggest stars.\n\nFrench DJ David Guetta recently used a site called uberduck.ai to mimic the voice of Eminem and add it to one of his instrumentals.\n\n\"I'm sure the future of music is in AI,\" he told the BBC.\n\nHowever, he said the technology could only be useful \"as a tool\" - like the drum machine and the sampler before it.\n\n\"Nothing is going to replace taste,\" he said. \"What defines an artist is, you have a certain taste, you have a certain type of emotion you want to express, and you're going to use all the modern instruments to do that.\"\n\nGuetta was named producer of the year at the Brits 2023\n\nOther faked tracks that have gone viral recently include a \"deepfake\" of Rihanna singing Beyonc\u00e9's Cuff It; and a cloned Kanye West singing the acoustic ballad Hey There, Delilah.\n\nThe rapid rise of the technology has rattled the music industry. Heart On My Sleeve, for example, does not infringe copyright, as it appears to be an entirely original composition.\n\nThe author has also made it explicit that Drake and The Weeknd were not involved in the making of the song, which should (in theory) protect them from a \"passing off\" claim, where they profit from misleading the audience into believing it is genuine.\n\nIn response, a broad coalition of musicians and artists have launched a \"Human Artistry Campaign\", whose aim is to ensure artificial intelligence will not \"erode\" human creativity.\n\nBacked by the Recording Industry Association of America, the Association for Independent Music and the BPI - which organises the Brits - the group has outlined seven principles advocating AI best practices, and stressed that copyright protection should only be afforded to music created by humans.\n\n\"There is so much potential with AI but it also presents risks to our creative community,\" said Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr, launching the initiative.\n\n\"It's crucial that we get this right early on so we don't risk losing the artistic magic that only humans can create.\"", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: The Angel Inn hotel in Sussex engulfed by a fire\n\nA 400-year-old hotel that was housing Ukrainian refugees has been engulfed by a major blaze.\n\nThe fire started in a property in North Street, Midhurst, in the early hours, before spreading to the roof of the Angel Inn hotel next door.\n\nMore than 30 people, including \"a number\" of Ukrainian refugees, have been evacuated, firefighters said.\n\nThe community was praised for its \"generosity and keenness to help\" after an appeal for donations was inundated.\n\nLocal resident David Behan, who witnessed the fire, said the refugees spent the night in a nearby Indian restaurant before they were transported to a leisure centre, from where they have been re-homed.\n\nMr Behan said: \"They arrived at Christmas with very little. And what little they had, they've just completely lost, which is desperate.\"\n\nMore than 30 people, including a number of Ukrainian refugees, were evacuated\n\nMidhurst Town Council arranged a donation point nearby for those who have been affected by the fire.\n\nThe site became inundated with donations and closed only hours after it opened.\n\nA council spokeswoman said: \"We have been overwhelmed by people's generosity and keenness to help, and now have everything we need to provide support for those who have lost their homes and belongings.\"\n\nThe refugees had been very much welcomed into the community here. Some had jobs, and you'd often hear people speaking Ukrainian on the streets.\n\nThe Angel Inn has been here for about 400 years, and has been owned by the same family for at least two generations.\n\nThe firefighters have told some of the residents that the building cannot be saved. It is going to have to be demolished.\n\nIt would be a horrible thing to have to lose for Midhurst.\n\nAnother local resident, Hilton Holloway, said some children were among those evacuated from the hotel, which he said had about 15 rooms.\n\n\"I spoke to one young woman who seemed relatively calm,\" he added.\n\nThe cause of the fire is not yet known. Four people were treated at the scene but did not require hospital treatment.\n\nRoad closures are in place, and firefighters, police and paramedics remain at the scene.\n\nThe fire brigade said crews were called to North Street at 01:08 GMT, and 15 fire engines and two aerial ladder platforms were deployed.\n\nA total of 15 fire engines and two aerial ladder platforms were sent to the scene\n\nFirefighters were met with a \"significant fire in the roof space\" at the hotel, which spread to neighbouring properties, a spokesman said.\n\n\"More than 30 people, including a number of Ukrainian refugees, were safely evacuated from the buildings, and they are now being looked after in a local relief centre,\" he added.\n\nSpeaking at the scene, the brigade's area manager, Richard Abbot, said: \"We are advising residents to keep their windows and doors closed as there is large amounts of smoke in the area.\n\n\"It's too early in the incident to know the cause of the fire, however we will be investigating the fire as soon as it is safe to do so.\"\n\nFollow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram.

Android phones, which are often more affordable, make up about 80% of the phones in Turkey.\n\n\"If Google makes a promise, or makes an implicit promise, to deliver a service like earthquake early warning, then to me, it raises the stakes,\" says Prof Harold Tobin, director of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network.\n\n\"They have a responsibility to be able to follow through on something that is directly related to life and limb.\"\n\nGoogle's product lead on the system, Micah Berman, insisted it had worked. \"We are confident that this system fired and sent alerts,\" he told the BBC.\n\nHowever, the company did not provide evidence that these alerts were widely received.\n\nMore than 50,000 people died in February's earthquake.\n\nAfter the first major 7.8-magnitude earthquake struck in the early hours of the morning, another major tremor shook the surrounding area at lunchtime.\n\nThe BBC was able to find a limited number of users who received a warning for this second quake.\n\nGoogle's Android Earthquake Alert System was announced in Turkey in June 2021.\n\nThe system is operational in dozens of countries around the world. The company describes the ability to send quake alerts as a \"core\" part of its Android service.\n\nIt works by using Android's vast network of phones. Smartphones contain tiny accelerometers that can detect shaking.\n\nWhen many phones shake at the same time, Google can pinpoint the epicentre and estimate the strength of a quake. Google has made an explainer on how it works.\n\nWhen an earthquake of magnitude 4.5 or greater is detected, the Android system can send a warning.\n\n\"This is an alert unlike any you've probably seen on your phone before. It takes over your phone screen,\" Mr Berman says.\n\nThe warning says \"drop, cover, hold\" and is accompanied by a loud alarm.\n\nIt should also override a user's do not disturb mode automatically, so you don't need to switch it on.\n\n\"No matter what state your phone is in, you should get that warning,\" Mr Berman says.\n\nGoogle claims the system successfully sent alerts on 6 February to millions of people.\n\nHow much warning people should have got from Google would depend on how far away they were from the earthquake, Mr Berman explains. A message travelling over the internet can travel much faster than the waves of an earthquake travelling through the earth.\n\n\"Sometimes [the warning] might be a second or a fraction of a second, sometimes it might be 20 or 30 seconds, sometimes it might be 50 or 60 seconds,\" he says.\n\nDespite extensive reporting across the earthquake zone in the hours, days and weeks after the quake, no-one mentioned getting an alert to the BBC.\n\nSo we began to search specifically for people who had got the warning.\n\nOur team travelled to Adana, Iskenderun and Osmaniye, cities between 70km (43 miles) and 150km (93 miles) away from the epicentre.\n\nWe spoke to hundreds of people with Android phones.\n\nAlthough we managed to find a small number of people who had got an alert for the second earthquake, we couldn't find anyone who got a warning ahead of the first, most powerful quake.\n\nIn Iskenderun, we spoke to Alican who lost his grandmother when a hospital collapsed. He says he had received the alert before, but he didn't get it this time.\n\nWe put our reporting from the earthquake zone to Google's Mr Berman.\n\nHe said: \"It's possible, given the massive impact of the first event, that this just quietly happened in the background, while users were really paying attention to lots of other things. At the end of the day, I think that's probably the most likely explanation.\"\n\nBut the people we spoke to were adamant that none arrived.\n\nFunda, who has been living in a temporary tent encampment since the quake, says she lost 25 members of her family.\n\n\"We literally dumped people into the ground. My brother-in-law and nephew were buried hugging each other,\" she says.\n\nFunda lost 25 members of her family in the quake\n\nShe owns an Android phone but told us she was \"certain\" she didn't get an alert.\n\nAfter an earthquake you would expect people to post on social media that they had received a warning. This is common in other countries where quakes have occurred since Google's system launched.\n\n\"One of the few feedback sources that we have is being able to look on social media,\" Mr Berman says.\n\nAnd yet after the first earthquake in Turkey, social media was unusually quiet - something Mr Berman accepts.\n\n\"I don't have a resounding answer for why we haven't seen more reaction on social media to that particular event,\" he says.\n\nThe BBC asked for data that showed people had received the notification. The only evidentiary document Google shared was a pdf with 13 social media posts the company had found of people talking of a warning that day.\n\nSo we contacted the authors of the posts.\n\nOne was Ridvan Gunturk, who had posted that he had got a warning in the city of Adana. However, after speaking to the BBC, he clarified that this was for the second earthquake. He confirmed he had not received an alert for the first earthquake.\n\nRidvan Gunturk received an alert for the second quake\n\nIn fact, only one of the social media posts referenced a warning about the first quake, giving a detailed account. The BBC has spoken to the author of the post, but they wouldn't give their name.\n\nThe author said they believed they had received an alert, but couldn't be completely certain of their memory of events at the time.\n\nGoogle also said it had received feedback from user surveys that say the system worked. However, it declined to share this information.\n\nProf Tobin told the BBC Google's system was relatively new, and could be useful, but that it was important for the company to be transparent.\n\n\"If you are delivering an essential life safety or public safety piece of information, then you have a responsibility to be transparent about how it works and how well it works,\" he says.\n\n\"We're not talking about an anecdote of, 'oh it's popped up here and there.' These are intended as blanket warning systems. That's the whole point.\"\n\nTurkish earthquake expert Prof Sukru Ersoy told the BBC his wife was in the earthquake zone. She has an Android phone but did not receive an alert.\n\nHe says that he has not spoken to anyone who got a warning.\n\n\"If Google's system had worked, perhaps it could have been very beneficial,\" he says.\n\n\"But the system not working in an important earthquake such as this one begs the question: if this is a beneficial system, why couldn't we benefit from it in this major earthquake, one of the biggest earthquakes of the last 100 years?\"\n\nIn a statement given to the BBC by Google after the interview, Mr Berman said: \"During a devastating earthquake event, numerous factors can affect whether users receive, notice, or act on a supplemental alert - including the specific characteristics of the earthquake and the availability of internet connectivity.\"\n\u2022 None Why was the Turkey-Syria earthquake so deadly?", "Friends and colleagues have paid tribute to Sasha Bondarenko's humour, intelligence and big heart\n\nFormer BBC News Ukraine journalist Oleksandr Bondarenko has been killed on duty on the front line in Ukraine.\n\nHe volunteered for Ukraine's territorial defence at the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, working as a communications expert and media trainer and then becoming part of the military.\n\nDetails of how he was killed in action are not yet known.\n\nClose friends said only that \"death caught up with him in a battle\".\n\nFriends, former BBC colleagues and Ukraine's wider media community paid tributes to a talented journalist who went on to be a successful communications professional.\n\nKnown as Sasha or Sashko, Bondarenko was originally from Luhansk in eastern Ukraine.\n\nHe worked for the BBC's Ukrainian Service from 2007 to 2011 as a news reporter, presenter and editor of radio programmes broadcast from Kyiv. He left the BBC to work for other media organisations.\n\nAt the start of the war Sasha Bondarenko worked as a communications expert and media trainer.\n\nAt the start of the war he was in charge of special projects for leading Ukrainian communications agency, RMA, whose staff paid tribute to his intelligence, humour and voice.\n\nHe was one of many thousands of Ukrainians who have left their civilian jobs across all walks of life to defend their country from the Russian invasion.\n\nAmong well-known Ukrainians who enlisted were members of one of Ukraine's top rock bands, Antytila, who became army medics, and broadcasters Pavlo Kazarin and Yurii Matsarskyi.\n\nA number of journalists have lost their lives reporting on the war too. A Ukrainian fixer working with an Italian reporter was killed this week as they came under fire near the southern city Kherson.\n\nVasyl Samokhvalov of RMA paid tribute to Sasha Bondarenko as a man who volunteered on day one: \"A human with a will of steel.

Including the last, heroic one, to defend his country from aggression.\"\n\nBondarenko graduated from Luhansk teacher-training college and started his career in journalism at a local radio station in the east of Ukraine, before working for leading Ukrainian TV channels and and then the BBC's Ukrainian Service.\n\nBBC Ukraine's editor-in-chief Marta Shokalo (R) paid tribute to her former colleague\n\n\"I look at our photos together and can't stop crying even though I can only remember our carefree days in the Kyiv office and how we laughed together,\" said Marta Shokalo, BBC Ukraine's editor-in-chief.\n\nHe went on to work as a TV reporter, covering the mass Maidan anti-government protests in Kyiv in 2013-14 and later Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in March 2014.\n\nAs a native of eastern Ukraine his insight of the complexities of Ukraine's relationship with Russia was seen as especially valuable.\n\nA keen athlete, he achieved a long-held ambition of swimming the Bosphorus.

Rishi Sunak says more fines and inspections will help tackle potholes\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak has promised a clampdown on potholes, as campaigning for the local elections gets under way.\n\nOn a visit to Darlington, in north-east England, he said new powers would help ensure firms repair roads properly after carrying out works, through more fines and inspections.\n\nSome 230 councils across England are holding elections on 4 May.\n\nThe PM was in Darlington for a campaign visit, alongside Tees Valley mayor Ben Houchen and local MP Peter Gibson.\n\nThe Conservatives are currently the largest party on Darlington Council, after Labour lost control of the council in the 2019 local elections.\n\nThe area is part of the so-called Red Wall of former Labour strongholds in the north of England and the Midlands, which the Conservatives are keen to retain at the next general election.\n\nEarlier this week, The Tories also set out plans to tackle anti-social behaviour , including banning the sale of nitrous oxide and making people who vandalise public spaces repair the damage they cause.\n\nThe prime minister said the Tories were \"delivering locally for the North East\", with the government putting more money into fixing potholes and clamping down on utility companies which left behind damage after digging up roads.\n\n\"There'll be more fines, more inspections, that's also going to help. We want to make sure it's easy for people to get around,\" he added.\n\nNew regulations, which were announced last year and come into force on Saturday, will bring in a performance-based inspection regime, with companies assessed on the quality of their road repairs and the worst-performing companies inspected more.\n\nThe Department for Transport said highway authorities now charged \u00a350 per inspection, and a further \u00a3120 for follow-up inspections, so there would be a financial incentive for firms to improve.\n\nThe government said it was investing more than \u00a35.5bn between 2020 and 2025 in highways maintenance, with an extra \u00a3200m to help fix potholes announced in March's budget.\n\nLabour's shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh accused the government of \"playing catch up after its own failures have left UK roads crumbling\".\n\n\"In 2021 the prime minister vowed to make potholes a thing of the past, but his decisions have left millions of them on our roads,\" she said.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats said the announcement was \"nothing new and just a complete re-hash\".\n\nMotoring groups have previously called for more investment to help improve the state of the country's roads.\n\nEarlier this month, a survey commissioned by the Asphalt Industry Alliance suggested councils in England and Wales only received two-thirds of what they needed this year to stop local roads further deteriorating.\n\nThe organisation said budgets had not kept pace with cost increases and government funding was not enough to prevent further decline of road conditions.\n\nIt found that 18% of the local roads network had been assessed as being in poor condition and having less than five years of life remaining.", "King Charles and the Queen Consort attend the Royal Maundy Service at York Minster\n\nKing Charles has taken part in a centuries-old Easter tradition for the first time since becoming monarch.\n\nHe and the Queen Consort handed out specially minted coins at York Minster during a day of visits in the region.\n\nThe pouches contained a coin celebrating the King's upcoming 75th birthday, and one marking the 75th anniversary of the Windrush generation.\n\nThe tradition of kings and queens distributing gifts on Maundy Thursday dates back to AD600.\n\nThe King waved to crowds as he arrived at the medieval cathedral, while a smaller group of protesters holding up placards reading 'Not my King' jeered as the royal car passed.\n\nQueen Consort Camilla meets members of the public in York\n\nThe King waved to large crowds as he arrived at York Minster\n\nThe King and Queen Consort's car passing a noisy group of protesters\n\nThe monarch and the Queen Consort were handed a traditional small bouquet of flowers as they entered the cathedral for a service marking the important Holy Week date, which commemorates Jesus washing his disciples' feet and the Last Supper.\n\nThe royal couple were also expected to formally open the Minster's new Refectory Restaurant as part of their visit, which is on the site of a former school that was forced to close in 2020 due to financial difficulties.\n\nThe Maundy Money ceremony takes place each year on the Thursday before Easter Sunday, with special coins given to one man and one woman chosen for each year the monarch has lived - 148 in this instance.\n\nA white purse contained silver Maundy coins equivalent in value to the age of the King.\n\nA red purse contained two commemorative coins, which symbolise the sovereign's historic gift of food and clothing.\n\nThe first recorded distribution of Maundy money took place at Knaresborough in North Yorkshire by King John in 1210.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II decided the traditional ceremony should take place in a different Anglican cathedral each year, to ensure it was not always held in London.\n\nThe coin-giving ceremony has been held at York Minster on two previous occasions by the late Queen, on 5 April 2012 and 30 March 1972.\n\nThe archbishop said the monarch's visit was a \"joy,\" especially given that the final choice of location for the Maundy service rests with the King.\n\n\"We weren't really expecting this, we were delighted because it's his choice where he comes,\" he said.", "Japan's Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako are now on Instagram\n\nIn 1926, when Japanese Emperor Hirohito ascended the Imperial throne, he was revered by millions of Japanese people as a living god.\n\nAlmost 100 years later, the world's oldest continuing monarchy is sporting a very different look.\n\nHis grandson, Emperor Naruhito vowed to bring the country's royal family into the modern age when he took over five years ago.\n\nAnd on Monday, the royal household took a very definite step into the 21st Century: they joined Instagram.\n\nThe move comes some 15 years after Britain's royals first made their social media debuts.\n\n\"The [Japanese] were perhaps the last notable royal family not to fully engage the digital era,\" notes social media analyst Andrew Hughes.\n\nBut it was an inevitable move. The family had made clear their wish to engage with younger generations and stay relevant; and given those subjects increasingly only get content through their phones, the family would also have to go online.\n\nBut for those hoping to get a more authentic glimpse into Imperial Family's day-to-day lives, the 48-hour presence of the @kunaicho_jp account so far might disappoint.\n\n\"When I heard [they] created an Instagram, I quickly checked it out. But of course the emperor wouldn't post 'today's lunch (heart emoji)' or anything like that,\" one fan wrote online.\n\nIn the 70 pictures and five videos uploaded across the kunaicho_jp [Imperial Household] profile so far, Emperor Naruhito, Empress Masako and their widely adored only child, the 22-year-old Princess Aiko feature prominently.\n\nBut a page divulging personal notes, reflections or even just more candid pictures of the royals this is not.\n\nThe British royals - who have had an official Instagram for several years - post different style of images to the new Japanese instagram page\n\nThe gallery so far is pretty formal in tone - just a round up of royal duties these last few months: public appearances, visits to museums, earthquake sites and meetings in drawing rooms with royals from other lands. There's some bonsai and a lot of bowing. A birthday celebration post shows the Emperor and Empress seated at a low table, smiling for the cameras.\n\nInstagram influencers go to great lengths to curate the overall look of their grid - for potential new followers to be won over in one glance by a brand that's cohesive and easy on the eye, a definable aesthetic.\n\nThe Japanese royals appear to have one too. A melange of beige and grey.\n\n\"The account's posts are extremely dull, the same kind of photos it shares in press releases,\" says Jeffrey Hall, a Japanese studies lecturer at Kanda University.\n\nThe Japanese royals hosting a visit with the royals from Brunei\n\nThe captions, written solely in Japanese, so far remain just factual recaps of the event shown in photos. Don't expect a casual first name sign-off just yet or any personal musings from the Emperor.\n\nAnd while they've seized on the Stories function- the tool usually used by Instagram users to post sporadic flashes of life - it appears so far the Imperial Household officials are just using it to showcase the B-roll of event photographs.\n\n\"I don't think that the conservative officials at the IHA have any intention of providing an interactive or entertaining experience for their Instagram followers,\" says Mr Hall.\n\nCrucially, they've also turned the comments off - a trend emerging out of the corporate world, social media analysts note.\n\n\"It stops any brand damage from those platforming their own causes, hijacking of comments\u2026 and basically diluting the content and harming the brand,\" says Mr Hughes, who teaches advertising and marketing at the Australian National University.\n\n\"They may yet change it but I wouldn't expect that as that would open a can of worms and they have very much seen what happens from overseas examples with other royal families.\"\n\nCertainly, while the Japanese royals might be making their online debut 15 years later than the Windsors, the furore over a photoshopped image of the Princess of Wales and her family in recent months would certainly be front of mind.\n\nAfter all, this is a royal family whose Chrysanthemum throne rule and lineage trace millennia, a royal house which did not wish to taint themselves with social media for well over a decade.\n\n\"Expect a very tight and narrow narrative and content as the Japanese royal family want to reinforce their conservative and safe brand image,\" says Mr Hughes. \"There will be no (Prince Harry's autobiography) Spare-style works emerging or any Photoshopped dramas.\"\n\nHe notes too that the Japanese have a slightly different relationship with their royals - more reverential, more respectful.\n\n\"They don't need to provide constant content initially, just more a subtle reinforcement of brand and minimising AI and disinformation and misinformation by controlling what is released and discussed. For me, this is smart brand management,\" says Mr Hughes.\n\nAnd while there have been tabloid scandals in the past, the Imperial Household has worked hard to keep the Crown family clean - by and large, they are still viewed by the Japanese populace as morally upstanding role models.\n\nPosts featuring Princess Aiko, like this one, have received the most likes so far\n\nThe family has long used traditional media channels, photography, newspapers and since the Meji period, TV programmes and weekly magazines to get their message across.\n\n\"However, these mediums were often employed to reinforce their positive yet distant image rather than fostering familiarity with the public,\" says Masafumi Moden, a Japanese Studies lecturer at the Australian National University.\n\nIt seems with Instagram, the family are continuing that strategy.\n\nSocial media might encourage close-ups, but for the Japanese royal family they're content to remain at arms length.", "Vladimir Kara-Murza told the court he believed Russia could one day be truthful, democratic and free\n\nEvgenia Kara-Murza has been surviving on autopilot ever since her husband, Vladimir, was convicted of treason for his public criticism of President Vladimir Putin and Russia's war on Ukraine.\n\nOn Monday, the Russian opposition politician was sentenced to 25 years in a high security prison and his wife has no idea when she or the couple's three children will ever see him again.\n\nShe's been so outspoken herself, she can't risk travelling to Russia in case she too ends up in jail.\n\n\"I'm afraid they might detain me to put pressure on Vladimir, and I can't afford him losing my voice as well, or leaving our kids without both parents,\" Evgenia explained over the phone from the US, where the family live for safety.\n\nShe says she's \"heartbroken\" - she hasn't even been allowed to speak to her husband since his arrest over a year ago - but for now she's numbed herself against the enormity of the verdict to focus on rallying international support.\n\nVladimir Kara-Murza is also a British citizen, but whilst the US, Canada and Latvia moved quickly to sanction Russian officials they hold responsible for the activist's plight, his own government has been left playing catch-up.\n\nOn Friday, the UK Foreign Office announced sanctions against one judge and two investigators involved in Kara-Murza's trial, as well as two Federal Security Service (FSB) agents suspected of links to his sudden, critical illness in 2015 and 2017 caused by a toxin that has never been identified.\n\nEvgenia welcomed that move, but it's well short of the more than 30 names she put forward.\n\n\"It only saddens me that it took a year of unlawful detention, a horrific sentence of 25 years in a strict regime and a very concerning deterioration of my husband's health for the British government to move to a somewhat stronger response,\" she told me, shortly after the announcement.\n\nVladimir Kara-Murza has again been losing feeling in both his feet and his left hand - symptoms which first appeared after his poisoning. A prison doctor has diagnosed polyneuropathy, which affects the nerves.\n\n\"For years, he was able to keep those symptoms at bay with regular exercise, but now they've returned and seem to be spreading,\" Evgenia says. \"I believe the Russian authorities are using it as torture; slowly killing a person.\"\n\nA college profile photo of a young Vladimir Kara-Murza - he later graduated from Cambridge and returned to Moscow in 2003\n\nVladimir Kara-Murza was born in Moscow in 1981 and moved to the UK as a teenager when his mother married a Yorkshireman.\n\nHe went to public school in Harrow then read history at Cambridge. He has a taste for tweed jackets and smoking pipes, and in one of the letters he sent me from prison, he listed Yes, Minister! and Fawlty Towers among his favourite TV shows.\n\nKara-Murza is as eloquent in English as in Russian, and uses both to condemn how President Putin has systematically crushed the democratic values that the activist holds so dear.\n\nBut his political ambitions have always focused firmly on his homeland. In his application to study at Cambridge, which I was shown, a teenage Kara-Murza described his greatest aspiration as \"leading the country in which I was born\".\n\nHe grew up during Russia's short-lived but intense burst of democratic chaos as the Soviet Union fell apart.\n\nAt 13, he even set up his own children's political party and tried to get it registered with the Justice Ministry in Moscow, which refused.\n\n\"Even for those democratic days, this was too much,\" he joked in one letter to me from his cell, with a grinning emoji.\n\nHis first significant political memory is of the failed coup in 1991, when hardliners tried to topple Mikhail Gorbachev and reverse his liberalising reforms. Kara-Murza's father joined the giant crowd that built barricades around the parliament then, and the activist describes those as \"the best and freest days\" in Russia's modern history.\n\nBy the time he graduated and returned to Moscow in 2003, President Putin was tightening the political screws.\n\nThat autumn, aged 22, Kara-Murza ran for a seat in the Russian parliament and lost. Genuine opposition candidates were still allowed on the ballot in those days, but the city authorities would extinguish the lights on his campaign billboards, and when he appeared in a TV debate, his microphone was cut.\n\nTwo decades on, he still refuses to be silenced.\n\nKara-Murza delivered an address in the Moscow court from a cage of bulletproof glass\n\nHis trial for treason was held behind closed doors although no state secrets were involved. Even the official charge sheet makes it clear that he's being punished for challenging the Kremlin: the case is based on public political speeches, made at home and abroad.\n\nSo when he gave his final address to the court from a cage of bulletproof glass, the only audience before him was made up of prosecutors, investigators and judges: all cogs in the system that had found the activist guilty the day it ordered his arrest a year earlier.\n\nBut the text of his speech was quickly leaked by his supporters who posted it online in a modern-day version of samizdat, the way works of dissident writers were copied and shared in Soviet times.\n\nIt was short, under four minutes, if you read it aloud. But Kara-Murza would have weighed every word, aware that it was the most important address of his political life.\n\nIt delivers his own, damning judgement of President Putin's rule. He calls Russia's president a \"dictator\" and \"usurper\" and condemns his \"criminal war\" on Ukraine. It's exactly the kind of talk that got him arrested.\n\nKara-Murza also recalls his great friend and political inspiration, Boris Nemtsov. Once a prominent reformer, Nemtsov was shot and killed in 2015, just metres from the Kremlin. Kara-Murza himself first fell critically ill a few months later.\n\nKara-Murza (right) seen alongside former Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov\n\nAfter meeting in England, the two became close allies and friends, later collaborating on a project that was a huge irritant to Russia's most rich and powerful.\n\nThey lobbied hard in the US for legislation known as the Magnitsky Act, allowing for punitive sanctions against Russian human rights violators. The bill took aim at a corrupt elite enjoying private schools, bank accounts and extravagant property in the West whilst trampling on basic freedoms at home.\n\nA series of European countries soon passed their own versions of the law and Evgenia Kara-Murza believes the treatment of her husband is payback.\n\n\"I think it's for a combination of things, including how he continues being unequivocal in his opposition to the regime and its crimes,\" she says. \"But 35 or 36 countries have the Magnitsky legislation now, which shows that Vladimir is very effective in his work. It's why they hate him so much.\"\n\nSergei Podoprigorov, the chief judge who sentenced Kara-Murza to prison, was one of the earliest targets of the list.\n\nBut Kara-Murza's \"Last Word\", his speech to a small, wood-panelled court in Moscow, was more than a denunciation of tyranny and a terrible war. It also conveyed his own dream, of another Russia. A country he still believes can one day be truthful, democratic and free.\n\n\"That day will come as surely as spring comes after even the iciest of winters,\" he insisted from the dock, addressing anyone who might hear, against all the odds.\n\nIt's that vision that has carried Vladimir Kara-Murza this far. It's now the faith he must cling to in the solitude of his prison cell.", "Last updated on .From the section Premier League\n\nChampions Manchester City will kick off the Premier League season on Friday, 11 August at promoted Burnley - managed by their former captain Vincent Kompany.\n\nLuton Town's first top-flight match since 1992 is at Brighton a day later, when fellow promoted club Sheffield United host Crystal Palace.\n\nMauricio Pochettino's reign as Chelsea manager begins at home to Liverpool on Sunday, 13 August.\n\nNew Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou takes his side to Brentford that day.\n\u2022 None Check out your team's fixtures in our club-by-club guide\n\nManchester United start the season against Wolves at Old Trafford on Monday, 14 August.\n\nManchester City, who are celebrating a Treble after winning the Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup in 2022-23, are now looking to become the first English team to win four successive titles.\n\nPep Guardiola's side have won the Premier League in five of the past six seasons.\n\nThe 2023-24 Premier League season concludes on Sunday, 19 May 2024.\n\nIn a statement on Thursday, the Premier League said it was \"committed to giving supporters a minimum of six weeks' notice on broadcasting selections until December 2023, and five weeks' from 24 January 2024\".\n\nFirst round of fixtures in full\n\nThe season schedule returns to normal, having been affected first by the Covid-19 pandemic and its knock-on impact, and then by last year's World Cup break.\n\nAnd the mid-season break returns, with teams given a clear weekend in January.

There were mainstream projects such as Ligo\" - the US-based Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory - \"but people were more focused on other aspects of physics.\n\n\"But my philosophy was, if I am going to do this I am going to enjoy it and this was what fascinated me most.\"\n\nThe first in his family to go to university, Dr Taylor said his parents always encouraged him to make choices that made him happy.\n\nFrom there, the \"Nasa-mad\" Dr Taylor had the opportunity to work at the space agency's jet propulsion laboratory before spending some time at the California Institute of Technology.\n\nThis led him to begin taking up leadership roles, chairing a working group looking at gravitational waves and getting a permanent position at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nHis team have been studying the signals which are emitted by pulsars and the affects of gravitational waves on their frequencies.\n\nDr Taylor described the radio beams from pulsars as being like light beams from a lighthouse. When the frequency at which they hit Earth changes, this shows gravitational waves as predicted by Einstein.\n\nHe said the most plausible cause of these waves is the orbit of supermassive black holes.\n\n\"We've seen loads of hints along the way but this is the first evidence in this kind of data set which is really exciting.\"\n\nDr Taylor said that, due to the frequencies, these black holes would be billions of times as massive as the sun and sit at the centres of galaxies.\n\n\"I never thought I would be involved in something like this. It was fun to be part of the physics and maths problems but I never thought it would get to this point,\" he said.\n\nDr Taylor said that the support of family, friends and his schools played a vital role.\n\n\"They never put up road blocks. I mean, if someone said they wanted to be a theoretical astrophysicist and try to make a big discovery, many would say, 'Catch yourself on'.\n\n\"But no-one ever really said that.\"\n\nBut it is not all plain sailing for people in Dr Taylor's field.\n\n\"It is not like in the movies, with a load of scientists around a computer saying, 'We got it; we're in'. There is no eureka moment.\n\n\"In this line of work it is a lot more about the small successes.

We estimate that events this bright occur roughly once every thousand years.\n\n\"By studying the evolution of this astonishingly bright GRB in great detail, we can learn a lot about the physics of a blast wave.\n\n\"Just like slow-mo cameras reveal details about movement, breaking our data into small time pieces allows us to see how the GRB changes and learn more.\"\n\nThe Swift team said its Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, a satellite telescope designed to study GRBs from space, was initially unable to observe the burst because the Earth was obstructing its view.\n\nHowever, 55 minutes later, when the satellite's orbit allowed it to have a clear view of the GRB, its systems successfully detected it and created images of it.\n\nDr Andy Beadmore, who is also part of the Swift team at the University of Leicester, said: \"These patterns are not just beautiful but are also useful scientifically.\n\n\"We're seeing a significant amount of dust in our galaxy being lit up by the intense burst of light from the GRB - two billion light years away - like a torch shining through a cloud.\n\n\"This lets us study its nature and composition, which was found to extend to large distances from the Sun.\n\n\"The brightness of this GRB means that we can collect much better data than normal, and so move beyond simple models of the GRB physics that we normally use - they just can't explain these data.\"\n\nDr Evans adds: \"Even after 18 years of operation, Swift can still surprise us with something unexpected, awesome, and scientifically powerful, and it can still challenge us.\n\n\"Those dust rings may look pretty but they gave us some headaches, they really complicated the data analysis.\n\n\"Even with those complications, though, this event gives us an opportunity to study a GRB in unprecedented detail.\n\n\"Then there's the beautiful dust halo that Andy discovered.\n\n\"This is caused by massive clouds of dust in our galaxy - but it's the light from the GRB, around two billion light years away - that's actually revealed those clouds to us.\n\n\"Now, we can measure their distance and their composition using this GRB 'backlight'.\n\n\"This discovery is a testament to the power of careful observation and the potential of serendipitous discoveries.\n\n\"I'm thrilled that our team was able to contribute to our understanding of the Universe in such a meaningful way.\"\n\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, or on Instagram.

The 28-year-old faces Vondrousova, who is ranked at number 42 and is also aiming for her own slice of history by becoming the first unseeded woman to lift the Venus Rosewater Dish.\n\nVondrousova, 24, was in London as a tourist with her wrist in a plaster cast when Jabeur lost to Elena Rybakina last year, following the surgery that sidelined her for six months.\n\n\"I'm just so grateful to be here. It's crazy that this is happening,\" Vondrousova said.\n\nThe Czech was runner-up in the 2019 French Open as a 19-year-old, so like Jabeur - who lost in the US Open final two months after her Wimbledon disappointment - has previous Grand Slam final experience to draw on.\n\nJabeur going to 'learn' from last year\n\nIn the Open era, only one player representing an African nation has won a Slam singles title - South Africa's Johan Kriek at the 1981 Australian Open. Kriek also won again a year later, although by then he was representing the United States.\n\nAs Jabeur seeks to become the first woman from the continent to triumph, she has been motivated by revenge at the All England Club and used that to despatch Rybakina in the quarter-finals.\n\nThe Kazakh was one of four Grand Slam champions Jabeur has had to beat in a tricky route to the final, having also made it past Australian Open title holder Aryna Sabalenka, two-time Wimbledon winner Petra Kvitova and 2019 US Open champion Bianca Andreescu.\n\nShe says when it comes to the final, it makes no difference whether you are facing a major champion or not.\n\n\"I think a final is a final,\" Jabeur said. \"Whoever could handle more the emotions, whoever could be more ready on the court, will definitely win that match.\"\n\nJabeur's run to another major final has come in a stop-start season where she has been hampered by injury and had minor knee surgery.\n\nIn typical fashion for a player known as the 'Minister of Happiness' back home, she sees the positives from those troubles and last year's disappointments.\n\n\"[The injuries] teach me how to be very patient and accept whatever happened to me ... because it was out of my control,\" she said.\n\n\"I mean, if you tell me you [would] get injured and be in the final of Wimbledon, I would take it.\"\n\nJabeur, whose emotional displays have won her many fans, is also hoping it will be third time lucky.\n\n\"I'm going to learn a lot from not only Wimbledon's final but also the US Open final, and give it my best,\" she said. \"Maybe this year was all about trying two times and getting it right the third time.\"\n\nAnd perhaps to avoid jinxing things, she has revealed this year what is on her phone's lock screen to motivate her this time round, telling reporters: \"You're going to know after the final.\"\n\nNo clothing sponsor yet, but cat sitter is sorted for Vondrousova\n\nVondrousova has come through tough tests in the past two rounds, knocking out American fourth seed Jessica Pegula in the quarter-finals before a two-set win over Elina Svitolina. The latter came in front of a partisan Centre Court crowd, who were emotionally invested in Ukrainian Svitolina's run that came nine months after having a baby and against the backdrop of war.\n\nShe is the latest in a long line of Czech female tennis players to reach Grand Slam finals, with nine major women's singles finals in the last 10 years - including Saturday's match - featuring players from the country.\n\nBut grass is not her best surface and certainly not one on which she would have expected to win a major title.\n\n\"When it was clay or hard, maybe I would say, yeah maybe it's possible,\" said Vondrousova, who has been flying so far under the tennis radar recently that she no longer has a clothing sponsor.\n\n\"But grass was impossible for me. It's even crazier that this is happening.\"\n\nSo unexpected was her run that she told her husband to stay at home in Prague to look after their cat, Frankie.\n\nShe has now changed her mind.\n\n\"We texted the cat sitter to come to our home,\" she said. \"He [husband] is coming tomorrow.\"\n\nFormer world number one Tracy Austin on BBC's Today at Wimbledon: \"This is the major she [Jabeur] wants. She's put Wimbledon above everything else on the tour. It's what she's wanted her entire career since she was a little girl.\n\n\"Last year it was either 50-50 or Rybakina with a little bit of an edge. But now she's against Vondrousova - number 42 in the world, unseeded, the first unseeded finalist in 60 years, and she's just been playing with house money.\n\n\"Remember in the quarter-finals, Vondrousova was down 4-1 in the final set [against Pegula] and somehow turned that around. She's loosened up and doesn't seem to be bothered about what stage it is. She's been to one final before, Roland Garros a few years back, it will be very interesting.\"\n\nNine-time Wimbledon singles champion Martina Navratilova on BBC's Today at Wimbledon: \"[Vondrousova] has a nice game for grass. Obviously, the variety works for every surface but especially on grass with the drop shots and the slices.\n\n\"She's only won four matches on grass in her career [before this fortnight] and she's been around for six or seven years. So really it's surprising she hasn't done better, but she's finally putting things together.\n\n\"[Against Svitolina] she was firing on all cylinders and looked a veteran of grass-court play.\n\n\"Clearly, Vondrousova likes the roof closed. It takes the wind out of the equation, and you can just hit your shots knowing the ball will land where it's supposed to. Vondrousova should play the final hoping the roof will be closed.\"\n\u2022 None Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone", "Mark Gordon and Constance Marten have now been found and arrested in Brighton - this CCTV image shows them in London in January\n\nThe police search for Constance Marten and Mark Gordon - and their newborn baby - began in early January, after the couple's car was found burning on the side of the motorway.\n\nPolice said Ms Marten, 35, had given birth one or two days before the fire, and had not been seen by medical professionals. Gordon, her partner, is a convicted sex offender.\n\nThe couple had left their home in Eltham, south-east London, in September, after Ms Marten first showed signs of pregnancy.\n\nAfter the car fire in January, the couple were on the move for a total of 53 days before being found - apparently evading police. They were arrested on 27 February.\n\nPolice said the pair would look away or cover their faces whenever they were near CCTV cameras. In the images of them that have been captured, they can often be seen wearing face masks.\n\nDetectives also said Ms Marten was from a wealthy family, from whom she was estranged after meeting 48-year-old Gordon, and that her inherited wealth could allow the couple to live off-grid for some time.\n\nThis is what we know about the couple's movements, based on CCTV images.\n\nCCTV still released by police of the couple's car on fire on the hard-shoulder of the M61 in Bolton on the evening of 5 January\n\nThe investigation began after a car was found on fire at around 18.30 on Thursday 5 January on the hard shoulder of the M61 near Bolton. The owners were not there, and police believe the fire had destroyed their belongings.\n\nIt was established that the car belonged to Constance Marten and Mark Gordon and that they had safely left the scene.\n\nIn the first few days after their disappearance, the pair travelled from the Bolton area to Liverpool, Essex, London and East Sussex, all in quick succession.\n\nThe couple were initially seen with carrier bags and a pushchair.\n\nPolice believe the couple first travelled to Liverpool and from there took a taxi to Harwich in Essex, arriving at about 03:30 on Friday 6 January.\n\nA member of the public saw Marten, Gordon and a baby in Harwich at about 09:00 on Saturday 7 January.

I am cautiously optimistic but I can't say if we will or not.\"\n\nSupt Lewis appealed for anyone with information to come forward.\n\n\"To kill two people in their own home with a shotgun in broad daylight - I think that would be a difficult secret to keep, so I wouldn't be surprised if somebody knows who the killer is and where information might be to lead us to that killer,\" he said.\n\nAnyone with information has been asked to submitted it to the investigation using an online public portal.\n\nThe bodies of the couple, who were in their 60s, were found in the cowshed at their farm the day after they were reported missing.\n\nThey had both been shot in the head with a shotgun and covered in carpet.\n\nThe couple were shot dead at their home in Llanharry\n\nA neighbour later told police they had heard two gunshots at about 13:30 on the day they were reported missing but had assumed Harry was out shooting rabbits.\n\nAt the time, their daughter Cheryl's boyfriend Jonathan Jones, then 35, was a self-employed recruitment consultant.\n\nHe told police on the day the Toozes were killed he took the day off work and went into Orpington to look for office space to rent, but police could not find anybody who had seen him that day.\n\nThe Toozes' daughter Cheryl and Jonathan Jones at their funeral\n\nHis partial thumbprint was also on a cup and saucer that had been found in the couple's living room.\n\nHe was arrested in December, five months after the murders.\n\nCheryl stood by him, moving in with his family in Caerphilly after his arrest.\n\nA year after his conviction Jonathan Jones was released on appeal.

But inflation in the UK has climbed faster and been more stubborn than in the US and EU.\n\nSome, including Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of England, claim Brexit may be to blame. But it's a complex picture.\n\nSingling out the impact of Brexit isn't easy, especially with the effects of a pandemic and a war. But there is evidence that the red tape - the form filling and other hurdles - required to bring goods into the country may have added to food bills.\n\nMore than a quarter of our food is imported from the EU.\n\nResearchers at the London School of Economics (LSE) compared how the prices of some of those items rose compared with those of food from elsewhere. The differences may reflect other factors, and may not be purely down to Brexit.\n\nBut the academics claimed that if they were, then the extra red tape could have added \u00a3250 in total to the typical household's grocery shopping bills between December 2019 and March 2023, with meat and cheese particularly affected.\n\nMost of that rise - about \u00a3210 - they say came through before our current cost-of-living crunch, in 2020 and 2021, as businesses were preparing and first implementing the new processes.\n\nBut in total, the LSE team reckons the changes could have accounted for over a quarter of the rise in food bills we've seen since the end of 2019. By contrast, the cost savings in new trade deals agreed since then have been minimal.\n\nSo while Brexit may not have been the biggest reason for our surging food inflation, the higher costs it added may have played a significant part.\n\nBut here's a small crumb of comfort - even with these changes, academics at Oxford Economics believe food is 7% cheaper in the UK than on average in the EU.\n\nAnd official statistics show a smaller part of spending in the UK goes on food - less than \u00a31 in every \u00a38 - than in France or Germany.\n\nHowever, a trip to the butchers, deli counter or nipping out for a pizza could become still more expensive.\n\nThe remainder of post-Brexit import checks and formalities on items brought into the UK to guard against risks to animal health and food fraud are due to be phased in from October, after they were postponed during the pandemic.\n\nThe government has streamlined several processes in the meantime, considerably reducing the extra bills importers were due to face.\n\nBut meat, dairy or fish products, for example, will have to be signed off as safe by a vet before entry, at a cost of hundreds of euros.\n\nEvery consignment of goods in such medium- and high-risk categories entering the UK will face a new charge at border posts of up to \u00a343.\n\nThe changes will cost businesses hundreds of millions of pounds per year. And customers may ultimately foot the bill.\n\nMeanwhile, the end of free movement means 330,000 fewer workers in the UK, according to one estimate from economists at the Centre for European Reform.\n\nThat is 1% of the workforce, but it is hitting some sectors harder than others - transport, hospitality and retail are all seeing more acute staff shortages.\n\nSuch employers tend to have to offer larger pay rises to attract and keep staff. While that is good news for those in work, who might have scored a bigger pay rise than they would have done otherwise, those costs are often passed on to customers.\n\nThen there is a less visible possible impact. Investment - in things like equipment, skills and IT - has stalled since the referendum.\n\nEconomists, including those at the government's own independent forecasters, say part of that gap may reflect Brexit-related costs or uncertainty. That makes the UK less efficient than it could be, meaning the cost of producing stuff is higher.\n\nBut with the Windsor Framework settling the arrangements for trading with the EU between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, economists hope some uncertainty has disappeared, and investment may get a boost.

They can become more aggressive: better at evading the immune system and able to spread around the body.\n\nA tumour starts as a single, corrupted cell, but becomes a mixture of millions of cells that have all mutated in slightly different ways.\n\nTracerX tracked that diversity and how it changes over time inside lung cancer patients and say the results would apply across different types of cancer.\n\n\"That has never been done before at this scale,\" said Prof Charles Swanton, from the Francis Crick Institute and University College London.\n\nMore than 400 people - treated at 13 hospitals in the UK - had biopsies taken from different parts of their lung cancer as the disease progressed.\n\n\"It has surprised me how adaptable tumours can be,\" Prof Swanton told me.\n\n\"I don't want to sound too depressing about this, but I think - given the almost infinite possibilities in which a tumour can evolve, and the very large number of cells in a late-stage tumour, which could be several hundred billion cells - then achieving cures in all patients with late-stage disease is a formidable task.\"\n\nProf Charles Swanton says challenge of tumours evolving inside our body means we need to focus on preventing cancer.\n\nProf Swanton said: \"I don't think we're going to be able to come up with universal cures.\n\n\"If we want to make the biggest impact we need to focus on prevention, early detection and early detection of relapse.\"\n\nObesity, smoking, alcohol and poor diet all increase the risk of some cancers. Tackling inflammation in the body is also being seen as a way of preventing cancer. Inflammation is the likely explanation for air pollution causing lung cancers and inflammatory bowel disease increasing the risk of colon cancer.\n\nThe evolutionary analysis has been published across seven separate studies in the journals Nature and Nature Medicine.\n\nThe researchers hope the findings could, in the future, help them predict how a patient's tumour will spread and to tailor treatment.\n\nDr David Crosby, the head of prevention and early detection at Cancer Research UK, said: \"The exciting results emerging from TracerX improve our understanding that cancer is a disease which evolves as it progresses, meaning that late-stage cancers can become very hard to treat successfully.\n\n\"This underscores the crucial importance of further research to help us to detect cancers at the earliest stages of their development or even better, to prevent them from happening at all.\"", "Troubled banking giant Credit Suisse says it will borrow up to 50bn francs ($54bn; \u00a344.5bn) from the Swiss central bank to shore up its finances.\n\nThe lender said it was taking decisive action to strengthen its liquidity as it looked to become a simpler bank.\n\nShares in Credit Suisse fell 24% on Wednesday after it said it had found \"weakness\" in its financial reporting.\n\nThis prompted a general sell off on European markets, and fears of a wider financial crisis.\n\nCredit Suisse said its borrowing measures demonstrated \"decisive action to strengthen [the bank]\".\n\n\"My team and I are resolved to move forward rapidly to deliver a simpler and more focused bank built around client needs,\" Credit Suisse's chief executive Ulrich Koerner said in a statement.\n\nProblems in the banking sector surfaced in the US last week with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, the country's 16th-largest bank, followed two days later by the collapse of Signature Bank.\n\nAfter Credit Suisse shares plunged on Wednesday, a major investor - the Saudi National Bank - said it would not inject further funds into the Swiss lender.\n\nThe worries spread across financial markets with all major indexes falling sharply.\n\n\"The problems in Credit Suisse once more raise the question whether this is the beginning of a global crisis or just another 'idiosyncratic' case,\" wrote Andrew Kenningham of Capital Economics.\n\nThe Swiss National Bank, which is Switzerland's central bank, and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority sought to calm investor fears, saying they were ready to help Credit Suisse if necessary.\n\nStrict rules apply to Swiss financial institutions to \"ensure their stability\" and Credit Suisse meets the requirements for banks considered systemically important, the regulators said.\n\n\"There are no indications of a direct risk of contagion for Swiss institutions due to the current turmoil in the US banking market,\" they said in a joint statement.\n\nThe BBC understands that the Bank of England has been in touch with Credit Suisse and the Swiss authorities to monitor the situation.\n\nCredit Suisse, founded in 1856, has faced a string of scandals in recent years, including money laundering charges and other issues.\n\nIt lost money in 2021 and again in 2022 - its worst year since the financial crisis of 2008 - and has warned it does not expect to be profitable until 2024.\n\nShares in the firm had already been severely hit before this week - their value falling by roughly two-thirds last year - as customers pulled funds.\n\nThe bank's disclosure on Tuesday of \"material weakness\" in its financial reporting controls renewed investor concerns.\n\nThese were intensified when the chairman of the Saudi National Bank, Credit Suisse's largest shareholder, said it would not buy more shares in the Swiss bank on regulatory grounds.\n\nAt that time, Credit Suisse insisted its financial position was not a concern.

not because the prosecution had abandoned any allegation.\n\nIn her closing speech, prosecutor Ms Agnew told jurors the case was \"about power and taking advantage of that power\".\n\nShe questioned Mr Spacey's claim that his accusers were motivated by money and suggested the trial was a result of his \"aggressive, oppressive and intimidatory behaviour\".\n\nThere was no doubt he was \"a very famous and lauded actor\" who was \"used to getting his own way\", she said -

a balloon inflated inside the uterus to stop bleeding - and they performed a hysterectomy.\n\nThe court heard how the HSIB report found staff underestimated how much relative blood volume she was losing because she was small and thin, which contributed to the delay in calling for emergency help.\n\nDespite extensive resuscitation efforts, her condition continued to worsen and she was pronounced dead two hours later.\n\nProfessor Mark Pietroni, medical director and deputy chief executive at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital NHS Foundation Trust said in a statement addressing the inquest: \"We want to take this opportunity to apologise once again for the immeasurable distress that this loss has caused.\"\n\nHe added the death was \"thoroughly investigated\" through the HSIB report and the trust did a further investigation.\n\n\"The findings of these investigations have been shared with Rana's family and HM Coroner and we have implemented all 10 recommendations made in the HSIB report,\" he said.\n\nModar Mohammednour and the family's solicitor, Hannah Carr, outside court\n\nDr Christine Edwards, consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, gave evidence about what steps the hospital had taken.\n\nThey included the trust updating their interpreter policy and installing a hands-free phone in each antenatal unit, so patients, doctors and a interpreter can be on the same call.\n\nA video has also been made explaining what a code red is and what happens when it is called, which is being shown to staff on mandatory training days.\n\nDr Edwards also said that, during training days, staff are reminded to evaluate the relative blood loss to a patient's weight, and a specialist drugs trolley for major bleeds after childbirth is on the delivery ward.\n\nRana Abdelkarim had moved from Sudan to Gloucestershire\n\nDr Edwards said a survey with staff was done in April 2022 on how comfortable they felt calling a code red, and one commented there was a \"fear\" and \"shame\" in pulling the bell, in case it was not needed.\n\nThe consultant said the \"culture of leadership on the delivery suite has been looked at quite intensely\" since then, and changes had been put in place.\n\nMs Skerrett said: \"I've been taken through all the steps taken by the Trust since this tragic death and, with Dr Edwards' evidence in court, I'm incredibly reassured by a lot of the steps taken.\"\n\nShe added that a report to prevent future deaths will be looked at once the hospital has completed a new survey, to see if the changes are working.\n\nThe family's solicitor Hannah Carr, from Novum Law, gave a statement after the inquest.\n\nShe said: \"I cannot begin to imagine how terrified Rana would have felt, without access to interpretation services and without access to her husband by her side.\n\n\"For Modar, while the trust has taken steps to learn from Rana's tragic death, this does not change things for him and his family.\n\n\"That said there is a sense of justice for him, as he has always said he wanted to prevent this from happening to other families.\"\n\nFollow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

It will also allow MDMA, known as ecstasy in tablet form, for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\nThe changes come into effect on Saturday, making Australia the first country to classify psychedelics as medicines at a national level.\n\nWhile initial access to the drugs will be limited and costly, many experts and patients are hailing it as a landmark moment.\n\nBut major health organisations have also urged caution.\n\nMarjane Beaugeois was diagnosed with severe depression in 2017. \"Within two months, I lost my mother, grandmother, beloved pet dog and my romantic relationship,\" she recalls.\n\nShe couldn't eat, shower, or leave her house in Melbourne - but says prescription antidepressants left her \"zombie-like, unable to cry, self-soothe or feel better\".\n\n\"I'd still go to bed praying not to wake up,\" the 49-year-old says.\n\nWhen her research for alternative therapies led her to a psilocybin clinic in Amsterdam, she was hesitant.\n\n\"I have no history of drug or alcohol use. As an addiction counsellor, I was always very against it,\" she says.\n\nBut she was also desperate to escape her treatment-resistant depression, so in 2018, she booked herself in.\n\nThe psilocybin was taken in a tea. \"Colours became more vivid. I felt powerfully reconnected to the world; warm and fuzzy. I'm getting emotional just talking about it\u2026 it was a massive, beautiful experience of unconditional love.\"\n\nThree sessions later, she felt healed. \"I could smile, feel joy, go about my daily routine with clarity,\" she says. \"When I got home, friends said they saw my eyes shining again.\"\n\nWhen Glen Boyes suggested microdosing psychedelics to treat his crippling depression, his therapist was sceptical.\n\n\"He explained it wasn't something he does, but he couldn't stop me, and would do brain scans to track my progress,\" he says.\n\nThe 33-year-old veteran says he began experiencing \"lingering PTSD\" from his time in the army, during Covid-19 lockdowns in Sydney.\n\nBut after 10 weeks of microdosing and therapy sessions, red areas on his initial brain scans showing blockages had cleared. \"My brain fog evaporated. I could think clearly again.\"\n\nDue to no other country rescheduling these substances for clinical use on a national level, the cohort who've experienced psychedelic therapy is small.\n\nProfessor David Nutt, Head of Neuropsychopharmacology at the UK's Imperial College, congratulated Australia on \"leading the world in this vital treatment innovation\".\n\nPsychedelic researcher and psychiatrist Dr Ben Sessa described the approval as pioneering. \"This is where the global psychedelic spotlight now shines,\" he told the BBC.\n\nDr Sessa has resigned from his job running the UK's primary psychedelic clinical organisation and will spend the next 18 months travelling to Australia to deliver a bespoke psychedelic prescribing training programme.\n\nOther countries have explored psychedelics for compassionate use, including Switzerland, Canada, and Israel - where regulators have made similar decisions, although not nationally like in Australia. Psychedelic clinics also operate legally in countries including Jamaica and Costa Rica.\n\nBut how Australia rolls out clinical prescriptions for both drugs, and at what price tag, will be closely watched.\n\nFirst developed as an appetite suppressant in 1912, ecstasy was used in therapy sessions in the US until the mid-1970s when it was outlawed. It entered Australia in the 1980s as a party drug due to its reported effects of increased energy, empathy, and pleasure, and was criminalised in 1987.\n\nIn the 2000s though, research slowly started up again - with recent trials finding that both MDMA and psilocybin can quickly improve symptoms of severe depression, though little is known about how they do this.\n\nMind Medicine Australia (MMA), a charity which lobbied for psychedelic treatments, is helping to train health professionals tasked with procuring and prescribing the drugs.\n\nTo become an authorised prescriber, psychiatrists must apply to an ethics committee and to Australia's drugs regulator the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). They'll then need to source and supply both MDMA and psilocybin.\n\nOnce all expenses are factored in - including the drugs themselves, supervision from multidisciplinary teams, psychiatrist sessions and hiring a private clinic - costs could spiral to A$30,000 (\u00a315,700, $20,000) per treatment, according to one psychedelics expert.\n\nDue to the prohibitive price tag, Dr Stephen Bright, senior lecturer at Edith Cowan University, says he doubts these treatments \"will be very widely available at all\" for the first 12-18 months.\n\nPhilanthropist Peter Hunt, chair of MMA, disputes those estimates, telling the BBC patients should expect to pay between A$10,000 for two psilocybin assisted therapy sessions, and A$15,000 for three MDMA assisted sessions. \"We costed the treatments with a mental health clinic,\" he said.\n\nBut with no planned government subsidies, the five-figure treatments are expected to remain unaffordable for most patients.\n\nAustralia's major medical and mental health bodies are among the loudest voices pushing back against psychedelic treatments.\n\n\"There's been considerable caution from the scientific and medical community,\" said Kristen Morely, a professor of addiction medicine at the University of Sydney.\n\nAccording to MMA, the \"weight of submissions from thousands of Australians whose current mental health treatments just aren't working\" helped get the TGA approval over the line.\n\nBut the Australian Medical Association (AMA) and the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP) have expressed serious concerns.\n\nBoth groups have called for larger-scale studies and better research into psychedelic treatments, warning of unknown risks, long-term side effects and \"potentially very limited benefits\" from their use in therapy.\n\n\"Psychedelic-assisted therapy may offer hope to a small number of people where other treatments have been attempted without success. But it's not a miracle cure,\" warned Professor Richard Harvey, who chairs the RANZCP's Psychedelic-Assisted Therapy Steering Group, warned.\n\nHe urged a \"cautious, considered and informed\" approach, due to the \"potential for psychedelic substances to cause fear, panic and re-traumatisation\".\n\n\"Vulnerable people can understandably feel distressed if their experience doesn't match their expectations of this therapy,\" he said.\n\nIt's also unclear, he argued, whether the results from psychedelic treatments stemmed more from the substances themselves, or the psychotherapy.\n\n\"Put simply, psychedelic-assisted therapy is in its infancy. There is more we need to know.\"", "Temperatures in the final stages of the campaign have hit 40C and millions of voters will be on holiday\n\nSpain is holding a highly unusual election on Sunday at the height of a scorching summer, after four years of left-wing rule.\n\nCurrent Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez called the vote in response to a dismal performance at the May local elections in which his Socialist party came second to main rival, the conservative Popular Party.\n\nNo general election in Spanish history has ever been held so late into the summer, with temperatures topping 40C in this country of 48 million people. The timing of the vote has been criticised when so many in Spain are on holiday, but 2.6 million voters have chosen to cast their ballot by post.\n\nThe Popular Party (PP) under Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o have their eye on victory but may struggle to form a government on their own.\n\nTo win a majority they need to secure more than half the 350 seats in the lower house of parliament. Spaniards will also vote for their upper house.\n\nThe conservatives may need the support of far-right party Vox, while Mr S\u00e1nchez will be able to look to left-wing grouping Sumar.\n\nLGBT and gender issues have become prominent campaign issues in the run-up to this election. Opposition parties PP and Vox have staunchly criticised the left-wing government's new laws on transgender rights - including making it easier for people to change their legal gender - and abortion.\n\nThey have also attacked Spain's controversial \"Only Yes Means Yes\" law on sexual consent. It was passed only last August but created a loophole that cut jail time for over 1,000 convicted rapists - and Mr S\u00e1nchez ended up having to apologise and push through changes.\n\nThe very existence of gender violence has been questioned by some Vox party officials, causing tensions with their potential conservative partners.\n\nNationalism has been a hot issue too. The PP and Vox have labelled Mr S\u00e1nchez a \"traitor\" for pardoning jailed pro-independence leaders and downgrading the crime of secession.\n\nOne highly effective right-wing tactic has involved targeting the prime minister with a slogan for relying on separatists to pass key reforms.\n\nHe has been denounced for his pact with Basque separatist party Bildu, led by Arnaldo Otegi, who was jailed for crimes by the Eta militant group.\n\nThe slogan \"Let Txapote vote for you\" accuses Pedro S\u00e1nchez of relying on the support of separatist killers\n\nThe slogan Que te vote Txapote, meaning \"Let Txapote vote for you\", refers to another Eta militant who carried out a number of deadly terror attacks.\n\nAs Spain experiences worsening droughts and heatwaves, most parties have measures to fight climate change. Only Vox's electoral programme fails to mention the issue entirely.\n\nThe biggest issue for most voters is the economy, even if much of the campaign has focused on other issues. Spain is enjoying a period of growth and inflation slowed to below 2% in June, one of the lowest levels in Europe.\n\nBut dismal jobless figures are one of the opposition's most frequent lines of attack against the current government. In May, Spain had the highest unemployment rate (12.7%) of all EU countries.\n\nPrime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez (L) called the snap election but Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o is favourite to win\n\nHe became the first politician in Spain to snatch power from a sitting prime minister through a no-confidence motion in 2018. Then he narrowly won a confidence vote in January 2020 to form Spain's first coalition government since democracy was restored in the late 1970s.\n\nPedro S\u00e1nchez, 51, is seen as a passionately pro-European integrationist and speaks English fluently; he has lectured in economics in Spain and had a spell working for the UN high representative in Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n\nHis brand of governing has been labelled Sanchismo, and his opponents have styled the election as a choice between Sanchismo or Spain, suggesting he is a threat to the country, its traditions and values.\n\nHe has spearheaded a law to bring dignity to victims of dictator Gen Francisco Franco, backed a rule giving workers the right to menstrual leave and laws expanding abortion rights.\n\nBut this snap election could be a gamble too far, as his party trails his conservative rivals. He has accused the PP of seeking to put Spain in a \"sinister time machine\" with the support of far-right Vox and take the country back to \"who knows where\".\n\nMr Feij\u00f3o has been less than enthusiastic about the prospect of a coalition with the far right\n\nThe Popular Party leader has knowingly cultivated a low-key image, saying recently that \"what for some may be boring, I think for the majority of citizens are qualities that a prime minister should have\".\n\nHe was seen to have won the only head-to-head TV election debate with Mr S\u00e1nchez, telling him he had no right to give lectures on governing pacts because the Socialist leader had relied on separatists.\n\nBut Mr Feij\u00f3o was later criticised for skipping the final televised debate before the election, which was attended by both his opponents, Mr S\u00e1nchez and Ms D\u00edaz, and his potential coalition partner, Santiago Abascal.\n\nA former civil servant born in Galicia in Spain's north-west, he has led the conservatives since 2022.\n\nHe has gained a reputation as a safe pair of hands, serving as president of the former national health service and of the postal service.\n\nHowever, his rivals have highlighted 10-year-old rumours that he had a close friendship with a Galician drug trafficker and money launderer called Marcial Dorado.\n\nPhotographs of the two on holiday together on a yacht in 1995 were unearthed by Spanish daily El Pa\u00eds in 2013.\n\nMr Feij\u00f3o says he was unaware Dorado was a criminal when the two became friends because \"back then we had no internet or Google\". Mr S\u00e1nchez has accused Mr Feij\u00f3o of lying, but the PP leader has hit back accusing him of using \"rubbish\" to seek to discredit him.\n\nSantiago Abascal's party takes a hard line on gay marriage, adoption by gay couples, abortion, euthanasia and transgender rights\n\nHe has led the far-right Vox party he helped found in 2014, and he is known for his controversial declarations. He has said he does not believe in climate change and he has criticised the \"totalitarian law of gender ideology\", which he claims criminalises men.\n\nLast month, he used the riots in France to call for tougher immigration policies. \"Europe is threatened by mobs of anti-Europeans\u2026 who are unwilling to adapt to our way of life and our laws,\" he said. \"Europe cannot continue to accept immigrants from Muslim countries.\"\n\nVox has already reached coalition deals with the conservatives in dozens of cities and three autonomous regions - Extremadura in the west, Valencia in the east and Castille and Le\u00f3n, north of Madrid. In the Balearic Islands, Vox have reached a pact with the PP but have no positions in government.\n\nNow Mr Abascal is looking for a share of national power too.\n\nHe has cultivated strong ties with other European far-right and nationalist groups, from Hungary's ruling Fidesz and France's National Rally to the Brothers of Italy party of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.\n\nMs Meloni has given Vox's election campaign her backing, recording a video to reaffirm the parties' \"great friendship\".\n\nYolanda D\u00edaz has gained popularity in Spain for her headline-grabbing policies\n\nIf Vox are the potential kingmaker for Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, then for the Socialists it would be Yolanda D\u00edaz's Sumar (Unite) alliance of 15 left-wing groups.\n\nA former Communist, she has been Spain's second deputy prime minister as well as labour minister and she is keen to be Spain's first female leader too: \"because women's time has come, and women want to be the ones who make history\".\n\nSumar have made a big pitch for the youth vote, pledging \u20ac20,000 (\u00a317,139) of funding to help 18-23 year-olds to kick-start their lives.\n\nMs D\u00edaz is a popular politician who has helped increase the Spanish minimum wage to \u20ac1,259 and scrapped unpopular labour laws.\n\nSparks flew between Ms Diaz and Mr Abascal in the last televised debate before the election as the two clashed over issues of gender violence, while she and Mr S\u00e1nchez appeared to form a united front.\n\nWhile opinion polls have narrowed, the conservatives and Mr Feij\u00f3o are favourites to win. But they may need to form a coalition with Vox to form a majority and avoid repeat elections.\n\nThe last opinion polls published in Spain put the PP on 33%-36% of the vote and the Socialists on under 29%. Vox and Sumar are almost neck and neck on 12.5-13.5%.\n\nTo win an absolute majority a party needs 176 seats, so no party would win outright with these results.\n\nVox has made great strides in securing power-sharing deals with the conservatives in three autonomous regions, and lesser alliances have been reached in Murcia, Aragon and the Balearic Islands,\n\nBut Mr Feij\u00f3o is less than enthusiastic at the prospect of governing with the far right.\n\nThe PP leader has seemed rattled by his rival's accusations of a \"shameful\" pact with Vox.\n\nIn their TV debate Mr Feij\u00f3o said Vox's Mr Abascal would not be a member of a prospective PP government \"if I don't need the votes\". He even offered the Socialists' Mr S\u00e1nchez a pact for the losing party to support the winner so that neither would need to rely on either the hard right or left.\n\nBut Vox could be the only option. Last month Maria Guardiola, the PP president of the western Extremadura region, said she would never govern with a party that \"dehumanises immigrants\" and that \"rubbishes\" LGBT rights.\n\nShe later changed her mind and welcomed Vox into her government, stating that \"my word is not as important as the future of Extremadura\".\n\nAs well as taking a hard line on gay marriage, adoption by gay couples, abortion, euthanasia and transgender rights, another big issue that has driven support for Vox is its unequivocal stance on opposing Catalan nationalism.\n\nIt has also taken a dim view over the status of Gibraltar, a British overseas territory at the southern end of the Iberian peninsula.\n\nLast year Vox objected to reports of talks between the UK and Spain by warning that \"any agreement that does not go through the recognition of the Spanish sovereignty of Gibraltar is an act of treason against Spain\".", "We could be entering the era of Alzheimer's treatments, after the second drug in under a year has been shown to slow the disease.\n\nExperts said we were now \"on the cusp\" of drugs being available, something that had recently seemed \"impossible\".\n\nThe company Eli Lilly has reported its drug - donanemab - slows the pace of Alzheimer's by about a third.\n\nHowever two volunteers, and possibly a third, died as a result of dangerous swelling in the brain.\n\nDonanemab works in the same way as lecanemab, which created headlines around the world when it was the proven to slow the disease.\n\nBoth are antibodies like those the body makes to attack viruses. But these are engineered to clear a sticky gunk from the brain, called beta amyloid.\n\nAmyloid builds up in the spaces between brain cells, forming distinctive plaques that are one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's.\n\n\"The decades-long battle to find treatments that change Alzheimer's disease is changing,\" Dr Cath Mummery, the clinical lead for the cognitive-disorders clinic at the UK's National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, said.\n\n\"We are now entering the time of disease modification, where we might realistically hope to treat and maintain someone with Alzheimer's disease, with long-term disease management rather than palliative and supportive care.\"\n\nThe full details of Eli Lilly's trial have yet to be published - but it has revealed the key findings:\n\nHowever, brain swelling was a common side-effect in up to a third of patients.\n\nIt was mostly mild or asymptomatic despite being detected on brain scans - but 1.6% developed dangerous brain swelling, with two deaths directly attributed to it and a third volunteer dying after such a case.\n\n\"We are encouraged by the potential clinical benefits that donanemab may provide, although like many effective treatments for debilitating and fatal diseases, there are associated risks that may be serious and life-threatening,\" Eli Lilly group vice-president of neuroscience research and development Dr Mark Mintun said.\n\nThe company said it would begin the process of having its drug approved for use in hospitals in the next few months.\n\nDr Liz Coulthard, from the University of Bristol, said there were \"significant side-effects\" and a lack of long-term data but the drug could \"help people live well with Alzheimer's for longer\".\n\nHaving two drugs slow the disease by targeting amyloid in the brain has also convinced scientists they are on the right track after decades of misery and failure.\n\n\"This should dispel any lingering doubts about this approach,\" Prof John Hardy, from the UK Dementia Research Institute, whose work led to the idea of targeting amyloid, 30 years ago, said. \"Having two drugs is great for competition.\"\n\nDr Susan Kolhaas, from Alzheimer's Research UK, said: \"We're now on the cusp of a first generation of treatments for Alzheimer's disease, something that many thought impossible only a decade ago.\"\n\nHowever, these drugs appear to work in only the earliest stages of the disease - before the brain is too damaged.\n\nAnd if they are approved in the UK, it would still take a revolution in how the disease is diagnosed to make a difference.\n\nOnly 1-2% of people have either brain scans or a spinal-fluid analysis to determine whether they actually have Alzheimer's or another form of dementia against which the drugs would be useless.\n\nAnd the NHS would have to decide whether it could afford them.

Watch: Why Hunter Biden is important to Republicans\n\nAn agreement expected to see US President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, plead guilty to tax charges and admit a gun offence has dramatically fallen apart in court.\n\nThe plea deal, negotiated over several weeks, was likely to spare the younger Mr Biden prison time.\n\nBut a judge on Wednesday said she could not \"rubber stamp the agreement\".\n\nThe case marks the first time the justice department has charged the child of a sitting president.\n\nHunter Biden's lawyers have been given 14 days to hash out a new deal with the prosecution.\n\nIt follows a five-year investigation into the finances of the US first son, who arrived on Wednesday morning at the court in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nIn a plea agreement announced last month, he was to be charged with two misdemeanour counts for failing to pay his taxes on time in 2017 and 2018.\n\nHe was also to admit that he had illegally possessed a gun while being a drug user, and agree to drug treatment and monitoring in lieu of a more serious felony charge and possible jail time.\n\nBut during the three-hour hearing, US District Court Judge Maryellen Noreika questioned whether the deal would also provide Hunter Biden with immunity from crimes he could be found liable for in the future.\n\nShe said the agreement contained \"non-standard terms\" and its proposed resolution for the gun possession offence was \"unusual\".\n\nOfficials with the justice department are still investigating whether Hunter Biden violated federal laws that required him to register as a foreign agent while working in China and Ukraine during his father's vice-presidency, CNN reported.\n\nLegal teams for both sides were seen negotiating in full view of reporters inside the court in an effort to salvage the plea deal or carve out a narrower agreement.\n\nBut the hearing ended with Judge Noreika, a Trump appointee, declining to sign the deal. She gave the two parties a fortnight to reach a new agreement and brief her.\n\nHunter Biden, who initially offered to enter a guilty plea, ended by pleading not guilty for the timebeing.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, the White House said the president and first lady \"love their son and they support him as he continues to rebuild his life\".\n\n\"Hunter Biden is a private citizen and this was a personal matter for him,\" said press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.\n\nThe misdemeanour tax counts are minor charges compared to the more serious allegations against Hunter that congressional Republicans have introduced in committee hearings.\n\nRepublicans allege that he was offered an unusually lenient plea deal because he is the president's son.\n\nThe House of Representatives Oversight Committee has already heard testimony from a whistleblower who claimed the justice department had deliberately stalled the tax investigation.\n\nThat is denied by the US Attorney for Delaware, David Weiss, who led the investigation.\n\nMr Weiss was appointed by former President Donald Trump and left in place by the Biden administration to finish the investigation into Hunter.\n\nHe has offered to testify in front of Congress to address criticism of the inquiry.\n\nRepublicans, who are examining various allegations against Hunter Biden, have focused on a notorious laptop that he apparently abandoned in a computer repair shop in Delaware.\n\nThe contents have been used to try to prove bribery and corruption against the president's son, and to attempt to connect his father to illegal business dealings.\n\nBut Democrats say it is no coincidence that Republicans are attacking the justice system while Mr Trump faces two criminal indictments and may soon learn of charges against him in two more cases.", "Ukraine says one of the Russian missiles shot down over the Kyiv region fell in the backyard of a house\n\nUkraine's capital Kyiv has been attacked from the air by Russia for the ninth time this month.\n\nKyiv's authorities said it seemed all incoming missiles had been destroyed, but debris falling from the air caused some damage in two districts.\n\nOne person has been killed and two more wounded in a missile strike on the Black Sea port of Odesa, officials say.\n\nBlasts were also heard in the central-western regions of Vinnytsia, Khmelnytsky and Zhytomyr.\n\nOverall, 29 out of 30 missiles launched by Russia overnight were shot down, Ukraine's Air Force said in a statement.\n\nRussia has significantly increased the frequency of its missile attacks on Ukraine over the past days and weeks, while Ukraine appears to be shooting down more of Russia's missiles.\n\nSo far in May, Russia has carried out four mass launches - two them between 16 and 18 May alone - compared to one each in April and March, and two in February.\n\nThe last time Russia attacked with such intensity was in the period after New Year, when four attacks took place in quick succession between 31 December and 26 January.\n\nThe train derailed near Simferopol on Thursday morning, Russian-appointed officials in Crimea say\n\nIn a separate development, rail traffic was suspended between Simferopol and the city of Sevastopol after a freight train carrying grain derailed.

Ms Onasanya did not contest the by-election in her seat, while Mr Davies stood in the by-election and lost.\n\nThe rules of the House of Commons mean that if an MP is suspended for 10 sitting days, a recall petition can be opened in their constituency.\n\nThe petition is open for six weeks, and if 10% of voters in the area sign it, it will trigger a by-election.\n\nSo there are a few hoops to jump through - the suspension is still to be approved by MPs, and given the ongoing parliamentary proceedings against Boris Johnson there is fierce debate about what sanctions should be applied for Covid rule breaches.\n\nMs Ferrier also has the right to appeal the committee's decision.\n\nBut it still seems likely there will be a by-election in Rutherglen and Hamilton West - a seat which has changed hands at the last three general elections.\n\nMs Ferrier won it for the SNP with a majority of 9.7% in 2019, but it was already a key target for Labour.\n\nAn early contest would be an immediate test for the SNP leader Humza Yousaf - and also for Labour counterparts Sir Keir Starmer and Anas Sarwar, in their quest to spark a revival in former Scottish heartlands.", "Joe Flaherty performs onstage during the Second City 20th Anniversary show in Chicago, 1979\n\nJoe Flaherty, the American actor and comedian known for his roles on Freaks and Geeks and the sketch comedy series SCTV, has died at the age of 82.\n\nFlaherty's death was announced by his daughter, Gudrun, who said it came after a \"brief illness\".\n\nBorn in Pittsburgh, Flaherty got his start in comedy as part of Chicago's improv group The Second City.\n\nHis career spanned nearly five decades, with credits on many beloved television comedies like Frasier and Family Guy.\n\nIn a statement, Gudrun said her father had an \"unwavering passion for movies from the 40s and 50s\", which influenced his career.\n\nShe added that he was particularly fond of his time on SCTV.\n\n\"He cherished every moment spent on the show, so proud of its success and so proud to be part of an amazing cast,\" she said.\n\nComedian Martin Short, Flaherty's former SCTV castmate, said in a statement: \"There were very few people as wise or hilarious when it came to comedy, teaching improvisation and the art of character work as Joe.\n\n\"In SCTV we called him the anchor.

with his imposing presence and strong oratory skills, Mr Price had long been regarded as a future leader.\n\nBut he departs after a report heavily criticised the workplace culture that existed in his party, alleging harassment, bullying and misogyny.\n\nA miner's son from the Amman Valley, Adam Price's politics were shaped by the long miners' strike of the mid-1980s.\n\nHe became an MP in 2001, representing Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, and made his mark in Westminster by leading an unsuccessful attempt to impeach the then prime minister, Tony Blair, over claims that Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction.\n\nMr Price stood down as an MP in 2010 before going to study at the prestigious Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University in the US.\n\nIn 2016 he returned to frontline politics - this time in Cardiff Bay, still representing his home constituency.\n\nOne campaign leaflet that year famously described him as an \"X-factor politician\" and the \"mab darogan\" (the son of prophecy) - a figure from Welsh mythology who it is said will redeem Wales in its hour of need.\n\nAdam Price and other party leaders meeting the Prince of Wales at the Senedd last year\n\nTwo years later he ousted Leanne Wood and became the first openly gay leader of a Welsh political party.\n\nMr Price described the decision to challenge one of his \"oldest friends in politics\" as \"the most difficult thing I've had to wrestle with in my political life\".\n\nMs Wood would later tell the BBC that the move led to the collapse of their friendship.\n\nIn a departure from his predecessor's approach, Mr Price put the notoriously tricky subject of independence at the heart of his political plan, pledging to hold a referendum on the issue by 2030.\n\nBut at the snap general election of December 2019 the party found itself squeezed out of the Brexit-dominated debate, and though Plaid held on to its four seats in Westminster, its share of the vote fell back and it came a disappointing third in its main target seat of Ynys M\u00f4n.\n\nLabour First Minister Mark Drakeford and Adam Price signed a co-operation deal in late 2021\n\nAnd so to the 2021 Senedd election, where independence would be front and centre of the party's campaign.\n\nAhead of the vote, Mr Price said that he would count anything less than becoming first minister as a \"failure\", and he ruled out working with the Conservatives and joining a coalition with Labour as a junior partner.\n\nBut the party slipped back into third place, losing its grip on the Rhondda seat held by Ms Wood, as it struggled to compete with the favourable response towards the Labour First Minister Mark Drakeford's leadership during the pandemic.\n\nMonths later, and with Mr Drakeford having fallen just short of a majority in the Senedd, Mr Price formed a co-operation agreement with the Welsh Labour government.\n\nThis was to be a new kind of deal, and one which would allow Plaid Cymru to push through some of its key policies, including Senedd expansion, the extension of free school meals, and free childcare for two year-olds.\n\nAnd that's why in the run-up to last May's Welsh local elections Mr Price - by now a father of two young children - was able to claim his party was \"making a difference\", and had \"snatched a moral victory from the mawing jaws of defeat\".\n\nBy the end of the year the party was engulfed by claims of a toxic culture within Plaid and criticism of the leadership's handling of the situation.\n\nThat culminated in a report by Nerys Evans which said the party had tolerated \"too many instances of bad behaviour\".\n\nMr Price initially insisted he would remain in post, arguing that quitting would be \"abdicating\" his responsibility.\n\nHowever a week on Mr Price has announced that he will step down and so it will be up to his successor to address the issues raised by the report and set a course for the party into the general election.", "An \"alliance of authoritarian powers\" is working more closely together against Western democracies, the head of Nato has warned.\n\nJens Stoltenberg told the BBC that Russia, Iran, China and North Korea are increasingly aligned.\n\nHe also said he was confident allies of the Nato military alliance would agree a long-term funding deal for Ukraine by July.\n\nBut he suggested Ukraine might have to decide on some \"kind of compromises\".\n\nMr Stoltenberg was speaking to Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg, in an interview to be broadcast on Sunday morning.\n\nOn the Middle East conflict, he said it was \"very important\" that the US and other Nato countries conveyed \"a very clear message to Israel\" that they have to do \"significantly more\" to protect civilians and aid workers after the World Central Kitchen convoy attack.\n\nMr Stoltenberg took over as the leader of Nato, the Western defence alliance, 10 years ago.\n\nSpeaking to mark the 75th anniversary of the organisation, he told me the world was now \"much more dangerous, much more unpredictable\" and \"much more violent\".\n\nHe said there is an \"authoritarian\" alliance giving each other practical support that is \"more and more aligned\".\n\nThe Nato chief explained: \"China is propping up the Russian war economy, delivering key parts to the defence industry, and in return, Moscow is mortgaging its future to Beijing.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

But his language is notable because President Volodymyr Zelensky has always been adamant that he would never negotiate with Putin despite some calls on him to do so, including from the Pope.\n\nMr Stoltenberg refused to be drawn on whether he was concerned about the possible return of Donald Trump to the White House, saying only that he was sure the US would continue to be an important ally, whoever was in charge.\n\nBut his remarks about the way regimes around the world are working together are a reminder for Western leaders of the complicated and dangerous diplomatic jigsaw they have to piece together.\n\nMore than two years into the conflict in Ukraine, our politicians must grapple with the reality that what is happening there is affected by decisions not just in Moscow and Kyiv but also in Washington DC, Brussels and London, as well as Beijing, Tehran and even Pyongyang.\n\nMeanwhile, six months into the Middle East conflict in Gaza, as Jeremy Bowen writes, solutions are affected by decisions not just by Israelis and Palestinians, but also Iranians, politicians in the US, the Gulf States and the UK.\n\nMost recently, this has centred on a row over arms sales, prompting criticism of the government from all sides. The latest intervention came on Saturday morning from one former Conservative prime minister, Boris Johnson, to another, Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron.\n\nForeign policy is rarely the overwhelming driver of votes and public opinion in the UK. This is partly because opposition parties traditionally try to avoid fights at home about battles abroad.\n\nIt's also partly because voters' top priorities normally centre on their own lives and the prospects for their families. But that does not mean that the public doesn't care, or is immune from the horror they see unfolding on their screens every day, or hasn't been affected by world events - take, for instance, the huge energy price rises caused by the Ukraine conflict.\n\nAnd conflicts around the world in all their complexities are increasingly occupying our politicians' time, energy and effort.", "O'Connor was best known for her single Nothing Compares 2 U, written by Prince\n\nIrish singer and activist Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor has died at the age of 56.\n\nHer family announced the news \"with great sadness\", saying \"her family and friends are devastated\".

When she ripped up a picture of the Pope on US television, she was thinking about victims of abuse, not about her image.\n\nHer later albums featured guest spots by her own children, and hymns to peace and community. Earlier this year, she won a classic album award in Ireland, and dedicated it to the country's refugee community.\n\nNothing Compares 2 U was the outlier: a song that made her famous against her wishes.

This decision largely centres on three studies suggesting a connection to a type of liver cancer.\n\nHowever, the \"possibly\" refers only to the strength of scientific evidence. If the evidence was strong, then aspartame would be in a higher category.\n\nDr Mary Schubauer-Berigan, of the International Agency for Research on Cancer, said the \"evidence was not of sufficiently high quality or convincing enough\" and \"this is really more a call to the research community\" to study the sweetener more.\n\nThe cancer classifications frequently lead to misleading headlines. Alcohol and plutonium are in the same category (both are proven to cause cancer), but one is seriously more dangerous than the other.\n\nSo a separate body - the World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives - has the job of working out safe doses.\n\nIt analysed the cancer risk as well as other issues such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes, but found \"no sufficient reason\" to alter the advice it has had since 1981.\n\nSo the safe limits remain at 40 milligrams per kilogram of your body weight, per day.\n\nThese aren't targets, they're the upper safety limits. But as the advice is based on body weight, it is easier for children to get close to the limit.\n\nDr Branca said it was \"not a good practice\" to have a bottle of sweet fizzy drink on the table at family dinner time, as children risked being set up with a sweet tooth for life.\n\nHe also stressed that large reviews of the evidence show sweeteners do not help people lose weight.\n\nSo his advice is for everyone to shift to a less sweet diet - cutting both sugar and sweeteners - and for companies to produce foods that are less sweet, but still tasty.\n\nOne of the big outstanding research questions is how might aspartame result in cancer (if indeed it does). The WHO reports show that aspartame itself is rapidly broken down in the gut into three other substances - phenylalanine, aspartic acid and methanol.\n\nBut these are also the product of digesting a wide variety of other foods that are not linked with cancer. And the researchers concluded that aspartame is not directly making cancerous mutations in people's DNA. Raising levels of inflammation in the body is one possibility.\n\nFrances Hunt-Wood, secretary general of the International Sweeteners Association, said the work had \"once again reaffirmed aspartame's safety\".\n\nShe added: \"Aspartame, like all low/no calorie sweeteners, when used as part of a balanced diet, provides consumers with choice to reduce sugar intake, a critical public health objective.\"\n\nThere are some people who cannot safely consume aspartame. These are people with an inherited disease called phenylketonuria or PKU, who are born unable to metabolise the phenylalanine that is released as aspartame is broken down.\n\u2022 None Aspartame - is it a possible cause of cancer?", "A pair of Air Jordan XIIIs worn by Michael Jordan during the 1998 NBA Finals has sold for $2.2m\n\nA pair of trainers once worn by basketball legend Michael Jordan has sold for $2.2m (\u00a31.7m) at auction, becoming the priciest shoes ever sold.\n\nThe signed sneakers - which Sotheby's had estimated would fetch $2m to $4m - are among the most expensive Jordan items auctioned.\n\nA jersey he wore at the 1998 NBA Finals sold in 2022 for $10.1m.\n\nThe latest sale seals Jordan's position as the most valuable athlete at auctions for sportswear memorabilia.\n\n\"Today's record-breaking result further proves that the demand for Michael Jordan sports memorabilia continues to outperform and transcend all expectations,\" said Brahm Wachter, Sotheby's Head of Streetwear and Modern Collectables.\n\nThe previous record for Jordan shoes was $1.47m for a pair of his Nike Air Ships auctioned in 2021.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThe Air Jordan XIIIs sold on Tuesday were worn by the basketball star during his last championship season with the Chicago Bulls in 1997-98.\n\nJordan had the size-13 shoes on when he scored 37 points in Game 2 of the 1998 NBA Finals series, carrying the Bulls to a 93-88 victory over the Utah Jazz.\n\nThe Bulls went on to win the championship, a story told in the 2020 documentary series \"Last Dance\" about the megastar's last season with the team.\n\nIt was Jordan's sixth NBA championship and the fifth time he'd be named the NBA's Most Valuable Player.\n\nRight after the Game 2 victory, Jordan gave the shoes to a ball boy in the locker room as thanks for finding a lost jacket, Sotheby's auction house says.\n\nThe \"Bred\" Air Jordans - short for \"black and red\" - are the only complete pair of sneakers worn by Jordan in an NBA Finals game to be authenticated, Sotheby's said.\n\nJordan wore the first Air Jordan shoe in 1984 during his rookie season with the Chicago Bulls.

There the occupational health nurse asked her about antidepressants.\n\nMs Mackenzie said that she had believed that by this time Police Scotland, or its occupational health advisors, Optima Health, would have had access to her medical records.\n\nShe said that she was taking an antidepressant drug for anxiety and depression.\n\nThe nurse consulted a colleague and then advised her of a \"two year rule\" stipulating that probationary police officers had to be free of antidepressant drugs for a period of two years before they could be considered for employment.\n\nMs Mackenzie said she was \"heartbroken\" by this after being transparent with Police Scotland about her health.\n\nInsp Davidson called her and was said to be \"shocked and apologetic\" that she could not be passed fit for duty and that her application would be taken no further.\n\nTo make the situation worse Ms Mackenzie said the Highlands and Islands division announced, just weeks later, that it had secured funding for a three-year mental health and wellbeing project for officers and staff.\n\nPolice Scotland also confirmed a formal partnership with See Me, Scotland's programme to tackle mental health stigma and discrimination.\n\nMs Mackenzie went on to work as a nursing assistant in a psychiatric hospital.\n\nBut information she learned during her training and while seeking advice, together with a similar case reported by the Scottish Sun newspaper, prompted her to launch legal action.\n\nDespite being outside the usual time limit for making a complaint, a judge ruled that an employment tribunal could hear Ms Mackenzie's case.\n\nEmployment cases normally must be brought within three months, but submissions made by Ms Mackenzie's legal team led Judge Russell Bradley to allow the case to proceed.\n\nA preliminary hearing will now take place at a later date.\n\nMs Mackenzie's solicitor, Jay Lawson told BBC Scotland that this was one of a number of similar cases against Police Scotland, which he said was \"worrying in itself\".\n\nMr Lawson, from Dundee firm MML Law, added: \"This is a hugely important case for our client given everything she has been through but also for employees and candidates with disabilities who are discriminated against during the recruitment process.\n\n\"There is always a bigger picture in a case such as this, in relation to raising awareness.\n\n\"Ms Mackenzie instructed us following seeing one of our other cases against Police Scotland and perhaps would not have pursued the case without seeing this.\"\n\nWendy Halliday, director of mental health charity See Me, told BBC Scotland: \"While there's been real progress in recent years, we know that there is still work to do to address stigma and discrimination for Scotland's workers.\n\n\"We firmly believe that no one should be denied a role just because of their mental health, with no other consideration as to how they are, what they could bring to a role, or exploring reasonable adjustments, as required under the 2010 Equality Act, that would support them to carry out the role.\"\n\nLee Knifton, director of Mental Health Foundation in Scotland, said: \"We can't comment on individual cases but we know that people living with mental health conditions are still facing discrimination.\n\n\"We need employers to show leadership and ensure that their recruitment and workplace practices do not negatively affect people living with mental health conditions.\n\n\"Around one in six adults live with a common mental health disorder and we are continually learning more about mental health, so any policies in this area should be reviewed regularly to ensure that outdated practices are curbed.\" A Police Scotland spokesperson said: \"It would be inappropriate for us to comment at this stage.\"\n\nHave you been affected by issues covered in this story?

Watch: Police car flipped over as Georgians stay defiant on streets\n\nThousands of protesters have taken to the streets of Georgia's capital for the second day after parliament backed a draft law which critics say limits press freedom and civil liberties.\n\nOn Tuesday, demonstrators clashed with police who used water cannon and pepper spray to disperse them.\n\nThe government said 50 police officers were hurt and equipment was damaged.\n\nSome 66 people were arrested, including an opposition leader who was reportedly beaten.\n\nSome protesters in Tbilisi were seen falling on the ground and coughing, while others waved EU and Georgian flags.\n\nThere has been widespread international condemnation of the bill. It would require non-governmental and media organisations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to declare themselves as \"foreign agents\", or face hefty fines and possible imprisonment.\n\nThe opposition says the Russian-style law marks a shift towards authoritarianism and would damage Georgia's chances of joining the EU.\n\nOn Tuesday, police warned protesters to disperse with a repeated message blaring through loudspeakers. Eventually, officers in riot gear cleared the Rustaveli Avenue, the main thoroughfare outside parliament.\n\nUS state department spokesman Ned Price said the draft legislation would be a tremendous setback and \"would strike at some of the very rights that are central to the aspirations of the people of Georgia\".\n\nThe EU is currently considering Georgia's application for candidate status and EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that the bill was \"incompatible with EU values and standards\". Many of those protesting waved EU flags.\n\nRussia passed its own version of a \"foreign agents\" law in 2012, expanding it over the years to target and suppress Western-funded NGOs and media.\n\n\"The law is Russian as we all know... We don't want to be a part of the ex-Soviet Union, we want to be a part of the European Union, we want to be pro-West,\" one protester told Reuters news agency.\n\nSpeaking via video during a visit to New York on Tuesday, Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili voiced her support for the protesters: \"I am by your side. Today you represent free Georgia. Georgia, which sees its future in Europe, will not allow anyone to take away this future.\"\n\nBut inside the parliament building, 76 lawmakers from the governing Georgian Dream party gave their initial support to the new \"transparency of foreign influence\" draft law.\n\nOn Monday, scuffles broke out at a committee hearing into the proposed legislation, with one pro-government MP slapping the leader of the largest opposition party.\n\nPassing the law would see Georgia join a list of undemocratic and authoritarian post-Soviet states such as Belarus, Tajikistan and Azerbaijan which have copied the Russian law on restricting the activities of NGOs.\n\nHistorically, the term \"agent\" in Russia and Georgia has the meaning of \"spy\" and \"traitor\", giving a negative connotation to the work done by civil society. It suggests they are acting in the interest of foreign forces rather than doing good for the country and society.\n\nThe US embassy issued a statement describing Tuesday's vote as a \"dark day for Georgia's democracy\".\n\nIt added that parliament's advancing \"of these Kremlin-inspired laws was incompatible with the people of Georgia's clear desire for European integration and its democratic development\".\n\nThe two bills, on the \"transparency of foreign agents\" and the \"registration of foreign agents\", were submitted to parliament by the openly anti-Western People's Power movement, a close ally of the governing Georgian Dream party.\n\nThe group has argued that the second bill was an exact analogue of the US Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA).\n\nGeorgian Dream supported the drafts, saying that such laws were needed to improve transparency.\n\nAt a briefing on Tuesday evening, the chairman of the governing party, Irakli Kobakhidze, hit back at the US embassy's statement, saying it was \"a dark day for the radical opposition and its supporters\".\n\nWhat most protesters and the country's opposition fear is that the adoption of the law would mark an end to Georgia's long-standing ambition to join the EU. More than 80% of Georgia's population supports Georgia's European perspective, which is also enshrined in the country's constitution.", "A pedestrian in Argentina was caught between two cars that collided before careening away in opposite directions.\n\nThe crash happened as the woman crossed the street at an intersection in La Plata a city in Buenos Aires Province.\n\nLocal authorities reported that the woman and drivers were not seriously injured.", "The family's holding company has not been divided equally among Silvio Berlusconi's five children\n\nIt's been the object of much speculation for weeks: who would lead Silvio Berlusconi's empire after his death?\n\nNow his will has been made public, it is clear he has handed a majority stake in the family's holding company Fininvest to his two eldest children, Marina and Pier Silvio.\n\nThey will jointly own 53% of the family firm.\n\nThe four-time prime minister died on 12 June from leukaemia.

She couldn't balance.\n\n\"She was only eating soup. She couldn't hold anything down. She lost a lot of weight.\"\n\nUnder cross-examination from state prosecutor Andreas Hadjikyrou, Mr Hunter said he had been hoping for a \"small miracle\" to help his wife's health improve and that she would change her mind about wanting to die.\n\nHe said: \"My mind was full 24 hours a day thinking of my wife. She was lying in pain, suffering, I couldn't do anything to help her.\n\n\"I wanted her to change her mind. I kept saying it's not easy [to help someone die], you can't just do something like that.\n\n\"I had no intention of killing her.\n\n\"It was her decision, she didn't want any more treatment. I can't tell her, she's got her own mind and she asked me. She wasn't just my wife, she was my best friend.\n\n\"You haven't seen the strain of the last six years, what she's gone through - the situation, the pressure. I wouldn't like anyone to go through the last six months we both went through.\"\n\nThe retired couple lived in Tremithousa, near Paphos\n\nAsked by the prosecution why he had told a doctor he had decided to end his wife's life but not tell her in case she changed her mind, Mr Hunter said he was \"under so much pressure\" and there were some things he could not remember as a result of a stroke.\n\nHe said he had told his wife that if she did die, he would have to take his own life, saying to her: \"I don't want to be without you for the rest of my life.\"\n\nDavid Hunter had waited 17 months for this.\n\nFinally, he could give his own version of events to the three judges who will decide his fate.\n\nWearing a black shirt and black jeans, the grandfather walked into the courtroom looking composed. He spoke for more than four hours through a translator.\n\nIt was a painful testimony. There were tears when he talked about the final moments of his wife's life and smiles when he spoke about their marriage.\n\nIn a trial for the murder he denies, today was an important day for him to explain why he says it was not premeditated, but a last-minute decision - and therefore, assisted suicide.\n\nThis is being seen as a test case in Cyprus where euthanasia is strongly opposed by the Orthodox Church.\n\nEarlier in the trial, the court heard Mr Hunter contacted his brother on Facebook to say he had killed his wife and then tried to take his own life at their home in Tremithousa.\n\nCypriot police were alerted by Interpol in the UK shortly before 20:00 GMT on 18 December 2021.\n\nOfficers arrived at the couple's retirement property and Mr Hunter was taken to hospital and later arrested.\n\nThe couple had moved from Ashington to Paphos 20 years ago.\n\nAfter the day's proceedings drew to a close, Mr Hunter spoke to reporters about giving evidence and said: \"I got my say, this is what I wanted. To tell them things that they never even thought about.\"\n\nAt home in the UK, the couple's daughter Lesley Cawthorne said it had been \"a very emotional experience to see my dad have to relive the worst day of his life\".\n\nFollow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

The writer describes long Zoom chats, messaging constantly and visiting Harry and his wife Meghan at their house in Montecito, California, as well as bonding with Harry over the loss of their mothers.\n\nMoehringer is an experienced celebrity ghostwriter who has written memoirs for retired tennis star Andre Agassi and Nike co-founder Phil Knight. The author says he always insists on a clause in his contract giving him the right to remain anonymous but, ahead of Spare's publication, his name was leaked to the press.\n\nHe then found himself \"squinting into a gigantic searchlight\" of media attention, he says.\n\n\"Every hour, another piece would drop, each one wrong. My fee was wrong, my bio was wrong, even my name,\" he writes.\n\nMoehringer said the experience made him realise he had \"understood nothing\" about how a life in the spotlight had affected Prince Harry - but said the Duke of Sussex was \"all heart\" and supported him throughout.\n\nSome copies of Spare went on sale in Spain several days before the official publication date. Journalists hurried to translate some of the most striking passages from Spanish back into English, leading to what Moehringer says were \"bad translations\" that \"read like bad Borat\".\n\nThe author says a \"frenzied mob\" then ensued in the media when the book was published in English. He says the bad translations didn't stop as \"innocent passages\" were \"hyped into outrages\".\n\nPrince Harry gave several TV interviews about his memoir, which included details of conflict with his father, King Charles III, and his brother, Prince William. Neither Kensington Palace not Buckingham Palace has ever commented on the contents of the book.\n\nLast week, Prince Harry flew to the UK to attend King Charles' Coronation - the first time he was seen publicly with his family since his controversial memoir came out.\n\nHe flew back to Los Angeles immediately after the Coronation service ended.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Drone footage shows how historic bridge was taken apart and rebuilt\n\nA historic bridge linking Scotland and England over the River Tweed has reopened after a \u00a310.5m overhaul.\n\nThe complex project saw most of the 200-year-old Union Chain Bridge removed and restored, then put back in place.\n\nThe work fell behind schedule due to a \"range of challenges\" but has now been completed.\n\nThe bridge - which first opened in 1820 - crosses the river from Fishwick in the Scottish Borders to Horncliffe in Northumberland.\n\nThe reopening completes a long journey for the historic structure and brings to an end a 10-mile detour for local traffic.\n\nA piper led the first crossing of the newly reopened bridge\n\nA campaign was launched in 2012 to restore the bridge due to concerns over its condition.\n\nIt had been shut for almost a year in 2007 due to structural problems.\n\nBy 2017, it was hoped that it would cost \u00a35.6m to upgrade the bridge in time to reopen in 2020.\n\nHowever, the price steadily increased to more than \u00a310m and it slipped behind the original timetable.\n\nMartha Andrews said the bridge brought communities on both sides of the border together\n\nMartha Andrews, a trustee of the Friends of the Union Chain Bridge, was among those delighted be able to cross the bridge once more.\n\n\"It is absolutely amazing to see the bridge open today, we have waited so long for this, we have campaigned so hard,\" she said.\n\n\"You don't realise how much you use it until it's not there so for the past two years we have being going round by Norham or round by Berwick instead of straight across the border, straight across the Tweed.\n\n\"It really brings the two communities together.\n\n\"We're going to be using it again and we are going to be using it every day and you'd be surprised if you stood here just how many cars go across it.\"\n\nThe bridge was the longest iron suspension bridge in the world when first opened\n\nThe Union Chain Bridge was built by retired naval captain Samuel Brown and completed in 1820.\n\nIt cost about \u00a37,700 to construct and replaced a \"perilous ford\" slightly downstream.\n\nAlthough work on Thomas Telford's Menai Bridge had started earlier, the Union Bridge was completed first - making it the longest iron suspension bridge in the world when it opened.\n\nHundreds of spectators, including civil engineers Robert Stevenson and John Rennie, turned out to see it open on 26 July.\n\nUntil the 1970s it existed with little maintenance, but the entire deck was replaced in 1974.\n\nThe bridge did not receive any major attention until structural issues started to emerge in recent years, leading to the \u00a310.5m overhaul.\n\nThe overhaul has taken two-and-a-half years to complete\n\nThe restoration work began once a full funding package was in place in October 2020 in the hope that it would take about 15 months to complete.\n\nCovid and the complexity of the project meant that it has taken about a year longer than was first intended.\n\nIts completion means that pedestrians, cyclists and cars can once again cross from one country into another.\n\nAs well as securing the long-term future of the bridge, it is hoped that the structure can become an important visitor attraction.\n\nCouncils on both sides of the border and the National Lottery Heritage Fund helped fund the restoration.\n\nJoe DiMauro of the Spencer Group said it had been a special project to work on\n\nJoe DiMauro - engineering director of the Spencer Group, which worked on the scheme - said it had been a special project.\n\n\"It is a real honour to have been able to work on a 200-year-old suspension bridge like this,\" he said.\n\n\"It is not every day you get the chance to use your engineering judgement to come up with methodologies and sequences to be able to take down, refurbish and rebuild something like this.\n\n\"There are not many of these structures around in the world so having the opportunity to work on this is a privilege.\"\n\nNorthumberland County Council leader Glen Sanderson described it as a \"fabulous moment\" for everyone involved in a \"hugely technical project\".\n\n\"This bridge stands as a testament to partnership working and shows what can be achieved when everyone is pulling in the same direction,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a glorious structure and I'm sure will be a huge draw to tourists as well as providing a much-needed day-to-day connection for local communities on both sides of the border.\"\n\nJohn Greenwell, of Scottish Borders Council, said \"years of hard work\" had gone into making the restoration possible.\n\n\"It's a symbolic link between England and Scotland which has now been protected for many generations to come and I am sure all those involved will feel an incredible sense of pride that this day has come,\" he added.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "A Sinn F\u00e9in MP has told an IRA commemoration that everyone has \"the right to remember, and the right to commemorate\".\n\nJohn Finucane was the main speaker at what has been billed a \"South Armagh Volunteers commemoration\".\n\nHe said there was \"nothing to celebrate in conflict\", but commemoration was \"a right which everyone is entitled to\".\n\nHis involvement in the event was condemned by IRA victims, unionists and the Irish government.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, Belfast East MP Gavin Robinson of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said Mr Finucane was \"a hypocrite\" for taking part.\n\nMr Finucane told the event that truth and justice were \"something which every person who has been impacted by our conflict deserves.\"\n\n\"For just as truth and justice applies equally to everyone, so too does the right to remember, and the right to commemorate,\" he said.\n\nMr Finucane's father, solicitor Pat Finucane, was shot dead by loyalist gunmen at his home in Belfast in 1989.\n\nThe Sinn F\u00e9in MP said he would defend commemorations by other groups - including loyalists - \"without hesitation\".\n\n\"There is nothing to celebrate in conflict, or in our difficult and painful past, but to commemorate those we have loved and lost is a right which everyone, including every single one of us gathered here today, is entitled to, and we do so with dignity and with pride,\" he said.\n\nThe event was held earlier in south Armagh\n\nSpeaking ahead of the event, Belfast East MP Mr Robinson said Mr Finucane had a few hours to decide if he wanted to \"proceed with being a hypocrite on these issues or withdraw\".\n\n\"You cannot burnish your credentials as a victim one day and then tarnish the memory of victims and their loved ones the next,\" he told the BBC's Sunday Politics programme.\n\nBut Mr Robinson, the newly-elected deputy leader of the DUP said victims were \"hurt\" by the prospect of Mr Finucane's attendance at the event in Mullaghbawn.\n\n\"This should not be happening,\" he said.\n\n\"When we consider the need to reconcile our communities that anybody, let alone a member of Parliament and a victim, would go to a family fun day to show respect for terrorists, shows just how shallow some of the commitments about an Ireland for all are, that have been shared with us over the previous number of weeks.\"\n\nGavin Robinson said victims of terrorism were \"hurt\" at the move\n\nOn Friday, a relative of one of the victims of an IRA bomb atrocity in Coleraine nearly 50 years ago criticised Mr Finucane's planned appearance.\n\nLesley Magee's grandmother, Nan Davis, was among six Protestants killed in the Coleraine attack on 12 June 1973.\n\n\"I don't think we should be commemorating terrorism on any level, whether it be Protestant, whether it be Catholic,\" she told BBC News NI.\n\n\"I have equal animosity towards both. I have no issue with anyone's religion, whether it be Protestant, Catholic, Judaism - whatever; I don't care.\n\n\"I don't think any MP should be at some kind of commemoration to celebrate a terrorist,\" she added.\n\nAlliance Party assembly member Sorcha Eastwood said she was disappointed Mr Finucane took part in the event.\n\n\"There is a difference between remembering and paying tribute to individuals, and commemorating terrorist organisations, including the IRA and its South Armagh 'brigade', particularly without reference to its many victims,\" she said.\n\nUlster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie said he thought the commemoration was \"scandalous\".\n\nT\u00e1naiste (Irish Deputy Prime Minister) Miche\u00e1l Martin had urged Mr Finucane not to address the commemoration, saying any attempt to \"celebrate or glorify horrible deeds from the past\" was not the correct way forward.\n\nBut earlier in the week, Sinn F\u00e9in assembly member Conor Murphy dismissed the row as a diversionary tactic by the DUP.\n\n\"I think what we are in here is distraction politics,\" Mr Murphy said.\n\n\"The real issue is here is the fact that public services are crashing round our ears.\"", "Former longtime BBC Radio 2 presenter Ken Bruce now appears on Greatest Hits Radio\n\nKen Bruce's Greatest Hits Radio show is being investigated by Ofcom over the station's campaign calling for offenders to be prevented from refusing to attend sentencing hearings.\n\nThe broadcasting watchdog said on Monday it would look at whether the station had complied with rules around impartiality and accuracy.\n\nThis year's Face the Family petition has been made directly to Parliament.\n\nIt was mentioned by a newsreader on Bruce's show on 13 April.\n\nThe broadcast also included clips in support of the campaign which directed listeners to a website.\n\nThe petition, signed by more than 13,000 people, was broadcast more than 30 times on the station, calling for new laws to \"require offenders to be in court for sentencing, to give victims and their families every chance to witness justice be delivered\".\n\nIt was explained that this could involve court and prison staff being \"given powers to use reasonable force to get offenders into the dock - as they do to transfer them from a court to prison.\"\n\nOfcom's spokesperson said the watchdog \"does not seek to question the merits\" of the campaign, which was broadcast more than 30 times on the radio station.\n\nBut they also noted how broadcasters are excluded from expressing views on \"political and industrial controversy or current public policy\".\n\nA Bauer spokesperson said: \"We are working with Ofcom to better understand the investigation into the Face the Family campaign, which ran in news bulletins in two local areas of the UK.\n\n\"The series is the latest in our tradition of local campaign journalism, which helps people who feel unheard have a voice.

It's a huge mistake. Banana republic style vindictiveness. It's, in my opinion, totally undermining our rule of law and sets the US up for real trouble ahead. It's a huge mess and completely destructive.\n\nThis action taken by the New York district attorney destroys any respect for the rule of law that many in the public had. It does not inspire trust or confidence in our system. It is very worrisome.\n\nAgain, can't stress it enough - it's a huge mistake and the ramifications are going to be deep and far reaching. I worry for the times ahead in our country. We're heading into turbulent times and our institutions and customs will be tested like we've never seen before. I hope our republic can survive - all because of a vindictive and petty, hypocritical step by a 'smallish' prosecutor in New York.\n\nThis is one of many things that he should be charged with, and more presidents should be charged with more wrongdoing than just Trump.\n\nI think that denying prosecution of a public or political figure is itself an inherently political move. Presidents should absolutely be held to the same - or higher standards - of public scrutiny and lawful consequences.\n\nHe should absolutely face prosecution. I genuinely think that the battle lines in the country have already been drawn. I think that people have made up their minds about Trump. They love him or hate him and I don't see that changing.\n\nI feel they want to put a 'stain' on Donald Trump's character - as no other president has been criminally charged in our US history.\n\nI am surprised that they actually indicted him. This looks very bad for our country and for Trump to run in 2024. The news will focus on this more than anything that Trump has accomplished, and it will have a negative impact on Trump's run for 2024.\n\nI'm saddened to see this happen and do not agree with the Manhattan jury. I hope Trump can pick a good running mate - he is going to need it.\n\nThese are indeed uncharted times we are embarking on. Living in the New York area, we are a bit on guard but overall I believe these growing pains are necessary for us as a country to affirm who we are - a country where no-one is above the law.\n\nIt's hard to find a person who believes the former president didn't break laws, they simply debate whether he should be charged, which in itself says a lot about the vulnerability of our democracy right now.\n\nFor me, it's a naked and blatantly gross breach of responsibility by the Manhattan district attorney that goes beyond anything I've ever witnessed in my life. It is an embarrassment that in this country, things have gotten to the point where an extreme stretch in interpretation of the law could be used in an attempt to take out a political opponent.\n\nThis is the stuff of banana republics and countries that have been or are under the control of dictatorial power. Moreover, I think the Manhattan district attorney, with all that is on his plate with regards to crime in his jurisdiction, is so out of touch to want to go after a former president instead of focusing on the immediate needs of his electorate.\n\nI predict this will come back to haunt Biden in the 2024 election cycle that is just now getting underway - look for Republicans to pull all the stops going after the president and his son in their investigations.\n\nI'm glad that the law applies to everyone. I look forward to him having to answer for himself and let a jury decide. I'm comfortable letting the system do it's job.\n\nI'm also really sad that this day has come to the US. The fact that this took a long time to happen is good - this wasn't some rush to achieve a pre-defined objective. I'm also hoping Trump is healthy at least long enough to see this to its conclusion.\n\nI also think that if Trump could watch Michael Cohen get convicted for campaign finance crimes he committed for him, it will likely make it easier to prove that there was in fact a federal crime connected to the money. I'm sure Cohen will feel vindicated.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nA man has been arrested after one person was left in a life-threatening condition and another was injured in a stabbing attack at a London hospital.\n\nPolice said the man arrested at Central Middlesex Hospital in Park Royal also sustained \"self-inflicted\" injuries.\n\nThe hospital was temporarily locked down but has since reopened with a heightened police presence.\n\nOne witness described how patients and visitors were locked in a nurses' room while police dealt with the incident.\n\nStaff were evacuated from the hospital building, where officers will remain as searches are carried out.\n\nThe Met Police said it was satisfied no-one else was being sought and that the stabbings were not being treated as terror-related.\n\nThe attack was reported at about 13:20 BST.

From 2020 - Pop royalty Kylie Minogue says lockdown was a \"weird time\" and a \"rollercoaster\"", "Dr Stephen Brearey says he escalated concerns to senior management about nurse Lucy Letby\n\nA doctor asked for nurse Lucy Letby to be taken off shift after raising repeated concerns about her presence and the deaths of babies - but was told \"no\", a court has heard.\n\nThe nurse denies murdering seven babies and the attempted murder of 10 others at Countess of Chester Hospital.\n\nDr Stephen Brearey told Manchester Crown Court he \"didn't want nurse Letby to come back to work\" until concerns had been \"investigated properly\".\n\nDr Brearey, who was head of the hospital's neonatal unit, asked for Ms Letby to be stood down after the deaths of two baby boys, who were part of a set of triplets, in June 2016.\n\nThe court has previously heard that the first boy, referred to as Child O, was in good condition and stable up until the afternoon of 23 June when he suffered a \"remarkable deterioration\" and died.\n\nHis brother, Child P, died just over 24 hours later after also being attacked by Ms Letby, it is alleged.\n\nThe prosecution claims Ms Letby murdered the boys by injecting air into their bloodstreams.\n\nDr Brearey told the court that the death of the brothers was \"distressing for those involved and deeply so with me\".\n\nHe said: \"All three triplets were born in such good condition, they were following a healthy path to growing and developing and hopefully going home.\"\n\nDr Brearey told jurors that Child O's collapse had come \"out of the blue\" and observed that in the hours before his death there had been an \"unusual\" rash on his chest. He said this was something he had not \"seen before or since\".\n\nLucy Letby is accused of carrying out the attacks at Countess of Chester Hospital\n\nFollowing Child P's death on 24 June, there was a debrief for the medical team on the neonatal unit.\n\n\"Ms Letby was present in that debrief. I asked her how she was feeling and I can remember suggesting to her she needed the weekend off to recover,\" the doctor said.\n\n\"She didn't seem overly upset to me in the debrief and told me at the time she was on shift next day, which was a Saturday.\"\n\nThe doctor said he had been \"concerned\" about Ms Letby going back on shift because he had \"already expressed concerns to senior management over the association between nurse Letby and the deaths we'd seen on the unit\".\n\nDr Brearey said he had called Karen Rees, the duty executive senior nurse, to report his concerns, explaining that he \"didn't want nurse Letby to come back to work the following day or until all this was investigated properly\".\n\nDr Brearey said Ms Rees had \"said no\", telling him \"there was no evidence\" for his claims.\n\nHe told the court he had asked Ms Rees if she was \"happy to take responsibility for the decision, in view of the fact myself and consultant colleagues wouldn't be happy with nurse Letby going to work the following day\".\n\nMs Rees responded \"yes\", the medic said.\n\nDr Brearey told the court that \"further conversations\" had taken place the following week and the decision had been taken to remove Ms Letby from frontline nursing duties - placing her in a clerical role instead.\n\nBen Myers KC, defending, noted that Dr Brearey had first \"identified\" Ms Letby as someone of interest as early as June 2015 after the death of the first three babies in the case.\n\nDr Brearey had noted, with colleagues, that Ms Letby was present when those three children died in 2015.\n\nMr Myers put it to the doctor that he was guilty of \"confirmation bias\" towards Ms Letby and had failed to look at \"suboptimal care\" given to the children in this case.\n\nMr Myers put it to Dr Brearey that if there had been a basis for his suspicions he would have gone to the police.\n\nDr Brearey said he and his colleagues had been trying to \"escalate appropriately\" and had needed \"executive support\" to decide the \"correct plan of action going forward\".\n\nThe doctor added: \"It's not something anyone wanted to consider, that a member of staff is harming babies.\n\n\"The senior nursing staff on the unit didn't believe this could be true.\"\n\nHe said with every \"unusual\" episode of baby collapse between June 2015 and June 2016 there had been \"increasing suspicion\" about Ms Letby, which led him to eventually escalate his concerns and request she be taken off shift.\n\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

Given the seriousness of the issue, it is part of the independent investigation being conducted by Fox Williams.\"\n\nIn relation to other allegations of sexual misconduct made by women against figures at the CBI, a spokesman for the lobby group added: \"It would undermine this important process and be damaging and prejudicial to all the individuals involved to comment on these allegations at this point.\n\n\"We will not hesitate to take any necessary action when the investigation concludes.\"\n\nSince the beginning of March, Fox Williams has been investigating separate allegations made against Tony Danker, the CBI's director general who has since stepped aside and \"apologised profusely\".

In a personal statement, Matt Hancock apologies to MPs for his \"minor breach\" of Commons rules.\n\nThe former health secretary, Matt Hancock, has been found to have breached Parliament's rules for attempting to influence an inquiry into a Conservative MP.\n\nA standards watchdog ordered Mr Hancock to apologise for the \"minor breach\".\n\nMr Hancock wrote a letter defending Tory MP Steve Brine, who was investigated over lobbying allegations.\n\nMr Hancock denied trying to influence the investigation by Parliament's standards commissioner.\n\nOn Monday, Mr Hancock apologised to the House of Commons, in line with the findings of the report by the Commons Committee on Standards.\n\nHe told MPs that the committee had \"found that I did not seek to break the rules, had no prospect of personal gain and acted without malice\".\n\nMr Hancock said: \"However they recommended I apologise to the House and the Commissioner for this minor breach and underline that respect for the Code and processes of investigating potential breaches of the Code is an important and necessary part of the Code. I am happy to do so.\"\n\nThe the Commons Committee on Standards found Mr Hancock had made \"a clear attempt to influence the commissioner's investigation\".\n\nThe committee said Mr Hancock had breached a rule that prevents MPs from lobbying the commissioner in a way that is \"calculated or intended to influence his consideration\".\n\n\"Mr Hancock is a former cabinet minister and has been an MP for over 10 years,\" the committee's report said. \"It is concerning that a member with this experience has not taken account of these provisions of the code.\"\n\nThe committee recommended that Mr Hancock should make a personal statement to apologise to the House of Commons and the standards commissioner, Daniel Greenberg.\n\nHe should also attend a \"briefing on his obligations under the code with the commissioner\", the committee's report said.\n\nMPs are expected to behave within rules set out in a code of conduct approved by the Commons, and any alleged breaches can be investigated by the standards commissioner.\n\nThe report said Mr Hancock had sent the commissioner an unsolicited letter while he was investigating Mr Brine - the chair of the Commons health committee - over claims he lobbied the NHS on behalf of a recruitment firm.\n\nLeaked messages from 2021 showed Mr Brine had been trying contact health bosses while acting as a paid consultant for Remedium Partners, a recruitment firm offering doctors for free to the NHS.\n\nMr Brine, a former health minister, said he was responding to a call from ministers to help the NHS during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe texts were some of the more than 100,000 WhatsApp messages involving Mr Hancock that were leaked to the Telegraph newspaper by journalist Isabel Oakeshott.\n\nLast month, Mr Brine was found to have breached the rules twice by failing to declare in his approaches to cabinet ministers in 2021.\n\nBut the commissioner, Mr Greenberg, cleared Mr Brine of paid advocacy.\n\nDuring the investigation, Mr Hancock wrote a letter to the commissioner, arguing \"that what Mr Brine did was acting overwhelmingly in the national interest\".\n\nThe rulebook for MPs says they should not try to influence the decision of the commissioner during an investigation into an alleged breach.\n\nMr Hancock, who became one of the best-known politicians in the country during the Covid-19 pandemic, remains suspended as a Tory MP for for taking time off from his parliamentary duties to appear on I'm A Celebrity last year.", "Last updated on .From the section Formula 1\n\nRed Bull's Max Verstappen took pole position for the Australian Grand Prix ahead of the Mercedes of George Russell and Lewis Hamilton.\n\nVerstappen beat Russell by 0.236 seconds as Mercedes had their best qualifying of the season.

A huge grain barge lay sprawled across a nearby sandbank. Water snakes and frogs slithered through the dwindling shallows as if in search of shade.\n\nTwo weeks after a suspected Russian sabotage operation destroyed the dam that holds back the Dnipro River to form the giant Kakhovka reservoir, some 18 cubic kilometres of water - enough to fill a shallow paddling pool the size of England - have surged south to vanish into the Black Sea.\n\n\"It's a catastrophe. Everything was washed away. Deer, wild pigs, fish and so many endangered species. And about half a million people are now left without water,\" said Anatolii Derkach, 37, secretary of the town council in Marhanets, on the western shore of the former reservoir.\n\nFrom his fourth-floor office, Derkach peered out across the grey, cracked mud towards the silhouette of Europe's largest nuclear power plant on the eastern shore. The Zaporizhzhia plant, with its six reactors, is currently under Russian occupation. With the water gone, the plant - some 10km (six miles) away - suddenly looks much closer.\n\n\"They say it will have enough water in its reservoirs for about six months. But we cannot be sure,\" he said with a sigh, followed by the inevitable warning-word \"Chernobyl\" - a reference to the nuclear power plant whose reactor exploded in 1986 in Soviet Ukraine, causing the worst nuclear accident ever.\n\nPeople queue to access drinking water in Marhanets, a Ukrainian town often targeted by Russian strikes\n\nMeanwhile Marhanets, a small town perched on a hill overlooking the reservoir, is often targeted by Russian artillery.\n\n\"They watch us with drones. If they see more than five people in one place they begin shelling,\" said Derkach.\n\nBut with the reservoir emptying, and water supplies now cut off, the council has been obliged to set up temporary distribution points around town.\n\n\"How do you think I feel? I'm walking around like a donkey, forced to carry water,\" said Iuliia, a pensioner standing in a queue of more than 20 people beside a set of taps and a large plastic tank in the town centre.\n\n\"It's not even drinking water. I'm scared for the future. I don't see any way through this,\" said her neighbour, Nina, 70.\n\nMarhanets, and other nearby towns, are drawing up plans to dig new canals to connect them to other reservoirs. But many residents have left, and local mines and other industries have been forced to close. Local farmers are now trying to access old wells and small streams to find alternative sources of water.\n\n\"I don't know what [the Russians] were thinking - doing that. The environment will suffer, and it will be hard for all of us,\" said Ivan Zaruski, 56, taking a brief break from loading bales of straw onto a trailer with a group of relatives and neighbours in field outside town.\n\n\"The main thing is that the nuclear power plant doesn't explode. But we'll survive all this. We have nowhere else to go so we don't have a choice,\" he added with a grin.\n\nMoscow says it had nothing to do with the destruction of the Kakhovka dam in Russian-occupied territory, and has accused Ukraine of firing missiles at it.\n\nIrina (R), with her husband Evhenii, said the water reached the roof of their small cottage close to the Dnipro River\n\nMeanwhile, further south, below the destroyed dam, the heaving flood waters that swept, without warning, through the port city of Kherson and smaller towns killing dozens of people and forcing thousands to flee, have largely abated.\n\n\"We're like rats - we can survive anything,\" said Irina, a 73-year-old retired teacher, as she and her husband, Evhenii, slowly dragged the drenched contents of their small cottage outside.\n\nAt one point the flood waters reached the roof of their home, on Tchaikovsky Street, close to the Dnipro River in the centre of Kherson. But now only a few big puddles remained outside, beside several small boats which had been used during the flooding.\n\n\"At least this happened at the start of summer. We still have time to dry things out,\" said Evhenii, stacking some stinking, rotting furniture in the yard.\n\nEarlier that morning, several Russian artillery shells had crashed into the centre of Kherson, and many more would land in this neighbourhood in the coming hours and days, fired from Russian positions on the far bank. Ukrainian troops were blocking cars from getting too close to the river, and much of the city seemed deserted.\n\nMost of the people who've stayed are elderly. They're not going anywhere\n\n\"Today was wonderful,\" said Oksana, who'd come to help her elderly parents on Tchaikovsky Street clean up after the flood. She was referring to news about Ukraine's counter-offensive.\n\n\"Our guys are doing a great job. We can tell who is shooting where. Our guys have had some big successes against Russian positions - and they've hit some large ammunition depots. I just wish it was all happening a bit quicker,\" she said.\n\nNearby, her 78-year-old father, Vladimir, slumped into a chair. He'd been kneeling, with an axe, to strip water-logged sections off an old cabinet, but had stood up too fast.\n\n\"He was born here. He's spent his whole life here.

Her husband Leonard Woolf said she was \"writing every day with a kind of tortured intensity\" to finish the novel.\n\nShe was institutionalised and attempted suicide several times throughout her life. She died in March 1941, aged 59, after taking her own life.\n\nThe University of Sydney said it appeared the rediscovered copy of The Voyage Out had been lost \"through the bustle of everyday campus and library life\".\n\nSimon Cooper, Metadata Services Officer from the Fisher Library, found the book incorrectly shelved in 2021.\n\nHe said: \"I knew the book didn't belong there, so I took it out and then saw the author's name handwritten on the first page.\n\n\"So, I looked up her handwriting to compare it, and it matched. It's her copy\".\n\nThe Voyage Out was incorrectly shelved and eventually found in the science section of Rare Books and Special Collections\n\nThe University acquired the book in the late 1970s through Bow Windows Bookshop in Lewes, East Sussex.\n\nWoolf and her husband Leonard Woolf had lived in the area - and members of the public can still visit their 16th-Century country retreat, Monk's House, which is owned by the National Trust.\n\nOriginal copies of her manuscripts, novels, essays and short stories now sell for huge sums.\n\nOne of the world's oldest antiquarian booksellers, Maggs Bros in London, told the BBC the rediscovered Woolf copy could be worth about \u00a3250,000 ($321,500) given the other first edition copy sold for just over \u00a391,000 in 2001.\n\n\"Prices have increased for this material since then, in some places quite substantially,\" said Bonny Beaumont, Modern Firsts specialist at Maggs Bros.\n\nSydney University Fisher Library staff member Simon Cooper found the book incorrectly shelved in the science section\n\nIn the rediscovered edition of The Voyage Out, handwritten edits made by Woolf can be seen in blue and brown pencil, with typed excerpts pasted onto the pages.\n\nSome of the changes could have been made by an editor or someone else.\n\nAn example of Virginia Woolf's edits\n\nAcademics say the rare text reflects Woolf's understanding of her own process of writing and how she developed the craft.\n\n\"It carries iconic value,\" said to Mark Byron - a professor of Modern Literature at the University of Sydney, who has studied the book in person.\n\n\"The revisions are fascinating in terms of what Woolf was thinking at the time,\" he added.\n\n\"Its role in Woolf's editorial decisions towards the first American edition of the novel in 1920 is an important element of its textual history.\"\n\n\"The inclusion of Woolf's annotations and corrections in her own hand, in pasted typed sheets, and in marginal editorial instructions, make this a unique object, shining a light on the composition processes of a pivotal novel in Woolf's career, and thus in the history of the novel in the 20th Century.\"\n\nHe added that the difficult composition of the novel led to the first significant adult breakdown for Woolf, suggesting the subject matter and narrative technique deployed in the novel may shed some light on matters of psychology and mental distress and its connection to Woolf's emergent career as a writer.\n\nSome have speculated that Woolf was \"potentially uncomfortable with how closely the reflections mirrored her own mental health when she was writing the book\" which is what led to the changes, Mr Byron said.\n\nThe Voyage Out has been fully digitised and is currently the only one of two copies made publicly available\n\nMost of Woolf's works are housed at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts and the Berg collection at the New York Public Library.\n\nMany have long believed that the other first edition of The Voyage Out owned by Woolf was held in an undisclosed private collection in the US. It is known as the \"Adams\" copy as it used to be part of a library belonging to a Mr FB Adams.\n\nHowever, the BBC has learned that the Adams copy is in London and owned by a private British collector.

Watch: From police interrogations to trial testimony, who is Alex Murdaugh?\n\nA powerful South Carolina lawyer has been found guilty of murdering his wife and son to distract from his multi-million dollar financial crimes.\n\nThe jury deliberated for less than three hours before convicting Alex Murdaugh, 54, of two counts of murder at the end of a six-week trial.\n\nHe faces a long prison term when he is sentenced on Friday.\n\nMaggie and Paul Murdaugh were shot at close range near the dog kennels on their family estate on 7 June 2021.\n\nAlex Murdaugh stood impassively as he learned his fate during Thursday evening's hearing in Walterboro.\n\n\"Today's verdict proves that no-one, no matter who you are in society, is above the law,\" said South Carolina's top prosecutor, Attorney General Alan Wilson.\n\nThe case - chronicling the downfall of a family born to power and privilege - has captivated the country, inspiring documentaries on Netflix and HBO.\n\nMurdaugh was once an influential personal injury attorney in the state, and for decades until 2006 his family members had served as the leading prosecutors in the area. Such was their influence that the jurisdiction became known as \"Murdaugh Country\".\n\nBut the trial heard that for years he had been stealing from his law partners and clients to feed an addiction to painkillers and an extravagant lifestyle.\n\nMurdaugh had pleaded not guilty to killing his wife and youngest son in an attempt to conceal years of financial corruption - fraud that he himself had acknowledged in court.\n\nAfter the 12-person jury's verdict, dozens of spectators gathered outside the back of the court where officers ushered a handcuffed Murdaugh quickly into a black van.\n\nReporters shouted questions, though he remained silent. As police tucked him inside the vehicle, one man behind the media line shouted that he was praying for him.\n\nMaggie Murdaugh, pictured here with Alex, was said to be a devoted mother\n\nIt took more than a year for investigators to arrest Murdaugh as they untangled the complex case.\n\nIn a risky move for any murder defendant, Murdaugh took to the witness stand, trying to convince the jury that someone angry over a deadly 2019 boating accident involving Paul could have killed his son to seek revenge.\n\n\"I would never hurt Maggie, and I would never hurt Paul - ever - under any circumstances,\" Murdaugh testified.\n\nThe case against him was based entirely on circumstantial evidence. No direct evidence - things like a murder weapon, blood on his clothing or an eyewitness - was presented at trial.\n\nInstead the prosecution focused on an incriminating Snapchat video taken by Murdaugh's son just before the murders.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nPaul and his mother were killed at the kennels on the family's sprawling hunting estate, known as Moselle.\n\nFor 20 months after their murders, Alex Murdaugh told law enforcement repeatedly he had not been at the dog kennels at all that evening, and was at home napping.\n\nBut in the Snapchat video filmed by Paul just minutes before the shootings, the defendant's voice could be heard in the background.\n\nOn the stand at trial, Murdaugh admitted he had lied, saying his years-long addiction to painkillers had put him in a paranoid state.\n\nThe court also heard of Murdaugh's bizarre attempt to stage his own death in an insurance fraud scheme just three months after he murdered his 52-year-old wife and 22-year-old son. The hitman he hired botched the shooting and the bullet only grazed his head.\n\nAlex Murdaugh (right) murdered his wife, Maggie, and his youngest son Paul\n\nLocal resident Jessica Williams, 38, stood outside the court watching the proceedings on the phone with her six-year-old daughter.\n\n\"I am so happy,\" she told BBC News after the verdict was announced, adding: \"I remember where I was when the verdict for OJ Simpson came down [in 1995]. This was the same thing.\"\n\nEarly on in the proceedings, Judge Clifton Newman ruled that prosecutors could bring in evidence of Murdaugh's alleged financial crimes.\n\nInvestigators say he stole nearly $9m from clients and colleagues to fund his addiction and his lavish lifestyle. And at trial, Murdaugh admitted to wide-scale theft.\n\nProsecutors argued it was these crimes that drove him to murder - that he thought the deaths of Maggie and Paul would gain him sympathy and stave off a reckoning over his other misdeeds.\n\nMurdaugh and his defence team had argued in court that this theory was ludicrous and financial problems would never have led him to murder.\n\nSeveral witnesses testified that on the night of the murders Alex Murdaugh had asked Maggie, who had been at the family's other property in nearby Edisto Beach, to return to Moselle.\n\nMaggie much preferred Edisto to Moselle and hadn't planned on leaving, her sister Marion Proctor told the court. But Murdaugh's elderly father was dying, and so Mrs Proctor encouraged her to support him.\n\nAlex Murdaugh and his two sons were fond of hunting, and Moselle was home to a collection of guns.\n\nProsecutors alleged that Murdaugh had used one of these - a .300 Blackout assault-style rifle - to kill Maggie, and another weapon to kill Paul. But they were unable to find either firearm and produce them at trial.\n\nMaggie was shot four or five times with a rifle and their son was shot twice with a shotgun, the trial heard.", "Reaper drones are full-size aircraft designed for reconnaissance and surveillance\n\nThe US has accused Russia of reckless behaviour after an American drone crashed into the Black Sea following an encounter with Russian fighter jets.\n\nBefore the collision, Russian jets are said to have dumped fuel into the path of the drone, which the US says was in international airspace.\n\nThe damaged MQ-9 Reaper drone was brought down by the US after it became \"unflyable\", the Pentagon said.\n\nRussia has denied its two Su-27 fighter jets made any contact.\n\nThe key question is whether the encounter was merely an attempt by Russia to disrupt the US drone and its work - or whether it was a deliberate attempt to bring it down.\n\nUS military officials said the incident happened at about 07:03 Central European Time (06:03 GMT) on Tuesday and the confrontation lasted around 30-40 minutes.\n\nSeveral times before the collision, the fighter jets dumped fuel on the drone in a \"reckless, environmentally unsound and unprofessional manner\", it said in a statement.\n\nPentagon spokesman Brig Gen Pat Ryder told reporters the drone was \"unflyable and uncontrollable so we brought it down\", adding that the collision also likely damaged the Russian aircraft.\n\nHe said the jets were able to land following the incident.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nBrig Gen Ryder said to his knowledge the Russians had not recovered the drone.\n\nThe United States' National Security Council's John Kirby told CNN: \"Without getting into too much detail, what I can say is that we've taken steps to protect our equities with respect to that particular drone.\"\n\nRussia's defence ministry said the drone crashed after a \"sharp manoeuvre\" and that it was flying with its transponders turned off. Transponders are communications devices that allow the aircraft to be tracked.\n\nProf Michael Clarke, visiting professor in war studies at King's College, told the BBC the collision was \"almost certainly an accident\".\n\nThe ex-director general of the defence and security think tank Royal United Services Institute said: \"I don't believe any pilot could deliberately do that [only colliding with another aircraft's propeller] without seriously endangering their aircraft and own life.\"\n\nThe incident highlights the increasing risk of direct confrontation between Russia and the US over the Ukraine war.\n\nTo protest against the move, the US summoned Russian ambassador Anatoly Antonov in Washington.\n\nFollowing the meeting, Russian state media quoted Mr Antonov as saying that Moscow saw the drone incident as \"a provocation\" and that \"the unacceptable activity of the US military in the close proximity to our borders is a cause for concern\".\n\nOn Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters there had been no high-level contact between Moscow and Washington over the incident.\n\nBut he said Russia would never refuse to engage in constructive dialogue.\n\nTensions have risen over the Black Sea ever since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.\n\nAfter Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year the US and the UK stepped up reconnaissance and surveillance flights, though always operating in international airspace.\n\nAccording to the US, there has been a \"pattern of dangerous actions by Russian pilots\" interacting with allied aircraft in the region.\n\nThis means the downing of the drone could conceivably have been the result of a mistake by a Russian pilot who got too close as they \"buzzed\" the unmanned aircraft.\n\nBut if this was a deliberate attack on a US aircraft by a Russian warplane, then analysts say that would amount to a huge provocation and a substantial escalation.\n\nIn that case, the attack would be seen as an attempt by the Kremlin to test the response of the United States.\n\nWestern allies have worked hard to stop the war in Ukraine escalating into a direct confrontation with Russia. But this incident over the Black Sea is just that. The US will now have to evaluate its response.\n\nAs US military commanders warned in their statement, this was a dangerous act that \"could lead to miscalculation and unintended escalation\".", "Mike Ferguson said his monthly gas bill is set to rise from \u00a32,000 to \u00a314,500\n\nMany of Scotland's ice rinks face closure due to crippling energy bills, a leading industry figure has warned.\n\nAyr Ice Rink confirmed it would shut its doors permanently in September solely due to unprecedented hikes in the cost of gas and electricity.\n\nScottish Ice Rink Association president Mike Ferguson said his Forfar business's monthly gas bill is set to rise from \u00a32,000 to \u00a314,500.\n\nHe said several Scottish ice rinks were now at \"the critical stage.\"\n\nMr Ferguson, who owns curling, bowling and ice skating facility Forfar Indoor Sports, said: \"Last year was incredibly successful for our elite athletes.\n\n\"It's terrific to see medals, but they'll mean absolutely nothing if we can't keep our club curlers curling.\n\n\"If we don't have ice rinks we won't have club curlers and we won't have a sport.\"\n\nAyr Ice Rink's Andrew Kerr said the business \"cannot cope\" with the rising energy costs\n\nAyr Ice Rink has operated for almost 50 years, but under its new energy deal faces a rise in its daily bill from \u00a3419 to \u00a3880.\n\nIt would have needed to find an extra \u00a3150,000 next year to continue operating.\n\n\"That just can't be done,\" its managing director Andrew Kerr told BBC Scotland.\n\n\"In a normal year we just break even, but this year coming up, with a hike in energy prices, we just cannot cope with it.\n\n\"Prices will come back down, I'm sure, for energy.

Watch: Explosions and gunfire as BBC reports from Jenin\n\nThere have been intense exchanges of fire between Israeli forces and armed Palestinian militants in Jenin refugee camp, in the occupied West Bank.\n\nThe Israeli military began what appears to be one of its most extensive operations in the territory in years with drone strikes early on Monday.\n\nNine Palestinians have been killed and 100 injured, health officials say.\n\nIsrael said it was putting a stop to Jenin being \"a refuge for terrorism\". Palestinians accused it of a war crime.\n\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent says its crews have evacuated 3,000 people - including patients and the elderly - from the camp to hospitals.\n\nIt says dozens of people had been detained by Israeli forces in their homes since early Monday, without being provided or allowed any food or drink.\n\nThe Israeli military said there was no specific timeline for ending the operation, but that it could be \"a matter of hours or a few days\".\n\nJenin has become a stronghold of a new generation of Palestinian militants who have become deeply frustrated by the Palestinian Authority's aging leadership and the restrictions of the Israeli occupation.\n\nThe city has seen repeated Israeli military raids in the past year as local Palestinians have carried out deadly attacks on Israelis. Other Palestinian attackers have hidden there.\n\nIn 2002, during the second Palestinian intifada, Israeli forces launched a full-scale incursion in Jenin. At least 52 Palestinian militants and civilians and 23 Israeli soldiers were killed during 10 days of intense fighting.\n\nHundreds of Israeli soldiers were still operating inside Jenin on Monday night, more than 20 hours after the operation began.\n\nAs well as the hum of drones overhead, regular bursts of gunfire and the loud thuds of explosions came throughout the day from the densely populated refugee camp, which is home to some 18,000 people and is now declared a closed Israeli military zone.\n\nAcrid smoke from burning tyres lit during protests also hung in the air above the city centre. A few young Palestinians were out on the streets, standing close to shuttered shops and staring nervously in the direction of the camp.\n\nThe Israeli military has cut off telephone communications and the electricity supply to the camp, making it difficult to get an accurate picture of what is happening. Palestinian medics have also been struggling to reach the dozens of injured there.\n\nAt the Palestinian hospital by the main entrance to the camp the mood was grim.\n\nOne man told the BBC: \"I met my brother's friend. I went up to him and had barely said a few words when he dropped on the ground. I went to run away, then I got hit by two bullets.\"\n\nAnother man said there was a \"massacre\" in the camp.\n\n\"There are children and civilians and they're not letting them out,\" he added. \"Our electricity is cut, they have dug up all our roads. The camp will be destroyed.\"\n\nJovana Arsenijevic of the medical charity M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res told the BBC she was at a hospital that had seen more than 90 patients wounded by gunfire or shrapnel from explosive devices.\n\nThe Israeli military said it was acting on precise intelligence and did not to seek to harm civilians, but many have been caught in the crossfire.\n\nThe military allowed about 500 Palestinian families to leave the camp on Monday night. Some raised their hands or waved makeshift white flags in a gesture of surrender.\n\nPeople told the BBC that some men and teenaged boys had been stopped by soldiers, and kept behind.\n\nHundreds of Israeli forces are on the ground in Jenin, said to be seizing weapons and explosives\n\nThe first drone strike overnight targeted an apartment that the military said was being used as a hideout for Palestinians who had attacked Israelis and as a \"joint operational command centre\" for the Jenin Brigades - a unit made up of different Palestinian militant groups including Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.\n\nDrones were used for further air strikes and a brigade-size force of troops was deployed in what a military spokesman described as a \"counter-terrorism operation\" focused on seizing weapons and breaking \"the safe haven mindset of the camp, which has become a hornet's nest\".\n\nIn the past year and a half, Palestinians behind some 50 attacks targeting Israelis have come from Jenin, according to the military.\n\nAs armed Palestinians began fighting back from inside the camp, the Jenin Brigades said: \"We will fight the occupation [Israeli] forces until the last breath and bullet, and we work together and unified from all factions and military formations.\"\n\nThe Palestinian health ministry said nine Palestinians had been killed by Israeli forces, including three in the overnight drone strike. They all appeared to be young men or in their late teens - some confirmed as belonging to armed groups.\n\nThe ministry warned that the death toll might rise because 20 of the injured were in a critical condition.\n\nAnother Palestinian was killed by Israeli fire during a related protest near the West Bank city of Ramallah, it added.\n\nThe Israeli military said the Palestinians killed in Jenin were affiliated to militant groups.\n\nTroops had also apprehended some 50 militants during the operation, and seized weapons and ammunition, it added.\n\nOn Monday evening, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised its forces for entering what he called the \"nest of terrorists\" and asserted that they were doing so \"with minimal injury to civilians\".\n\n\"We will continue this action as long as necessary in order to restore quiet and security,\" he added.\n\nThere was a furious response to the operation from the Palestinian Authority Prime Minister, Mohammed Shtayyeh.\n\n\"What's going on is an attempt to erase the refugee camp completely and displace the residents,\" he said.\n\nNeighbouring Jordan said the operation was \"a clear violation of international humanitarian law\", but the US expressed its support for what it called \"Israel's security and right to defend its people against Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and other terrorist groups\".\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen said the plan was not to expand the military operation outside Jenin, but already Palestinian protests have reached the Hamas-governed Gaza Strip. And the longer this action goes on in Jenin, the greater the risk of another dangerous, wider escalation.\n\nThe Jenin Brigade group has said its militants will fight back with their \"last breath and bullet\"\n\nThere has been a surge of violence in the West Bank in recent months.\n\nOn 20 June, seven Palestinians were killed during an Israeli raid in Jenin which saw the military's first use of an attack helicopter in the West Bank in years.\n\nThe next day, two Hamas gunmen shot dead four Israelis near the settlement of Eli, 40km (25 miles) to the south.\n\nA Palestinian man was later shot dead during a rampage by hundreds of settlers in the nearby town of Turmusaya.\n\nThat week also saw three Palestinian militants from Jenin killed in a rare Israeli drone strike.\n\nSince the start of the year, more than 140 Palestinians - both militants and civilians - have been killed by Israeli forces or settlers in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, while another 36 have been killed in the Gaza Strip.\n\nTwenty-four Israelis, two foreigners and a Palestinian worker have been killed in attacks or apparent attacks by Palestinians in Israel and the West Bank. All were civilians except one off-duty serving soldier and a member of the Israeli security forces.\n\nAdditional reporting by Rushdi Abu Alouf in Gaza City and Robert Greenall in London", "Barnaby Webber and Grace O'Malley-Kumar were walking together when they were attacked\n\nThe families of two students killed in Nottingham last month are to create foundations in their name to ensure they \"leave a legacy\".\n\nGrace O'Malley-Kumar and Barnaby Webber, both 19, were stabbed to death early on 13 June.\n\nBoth sets of relatives have now set up online appeals to support causes the students particularly cared about.\n\nAn earlier fundraiser in memory of the third victim, Ian Coates, 65, raised more than \u00a328,000.\n\nThe families of Grace O'Malley-Kumar and Barnaby Webber attended vigils in Nottingham\n\nOn Wednesday, a GoFundMe appeal was launched by Ms O'Malley-Kumar's younger brother, James, six days after Mr Webber's mother, Emma, set up a similar fundraiser online.\n\nMr Kumar said: \"She leaves behind devastated and heartbroken extended family and friends but we all feel compelled that something good must come from the loss of Grace's life.\n\n\"In time an official 'Grace O'Malley-Kumar Foundation' will be created and donations will be used to further all that Grace supported and felt she would like to help with.\n\n\"To ensure that Grace's name leaves a legacy and to keep her memory alive we have created this fund.\n\nMr Kumar said all the money would go to the foundation \"once the finer details have been arranged\".\n\nSince being created the fundraiser has already raised more than \u00a37,500 of its \u00a310,000 target.\n\nThe attacks led to large parts of Nottingham being cordoned off\n\nMeanwhile, the appeal for Mr Webber has already surpassed its \u00a35,300 goal, with almost \u00a310,000 being donated.\n\nHis mother said: \"He leaves behind a family broken by grief and loss but determined not to let him be taken in vain.\n\n\"He lived his life with a simple 'if he liked you he liked you' mantra.

after displaying daffodils alongside spring onions in one of its stores.\n\nThe flowers, which can be poisonous if eaten, were displayed in the fruit and veg aisle under a \"seasonal favourites\" banner.\n\nBotanist and presenter James Wong drew attention to the display on Twitter, warning that eating daffodils \"is like swallowing a box of tiny needles\".\n\nAn M&S spokesperson said it was a \"genuine error in one of our stores\".\n\nDaffodil stems, which are widely sold in supermarkets at this time of year, can bear a resemblance to some vegetables at first glance.\n\nPublic Health England wrote to retailers in 2015 warning about the potentially nasty consequences if there was a mix-up with how they are labelled.\n\nIt said they contain toxic alkaloids which can cause severe vomiting, noting 27 poisoning cases in the previous year.\n\nHealth officials believe daffodil poisoning led to 10 hospitalisations in Bristol in 2012 because of their similarity to a chive used in Chinese cooking.\n\nMr Wong said the error was originally spotted by his mum, who took a picture of the display.\n\nHe said the poisoning caused by accidentally eating them can be \"excruciating\" and

Rishi Sunak in his first electoral test as prime minister, Labour has said.\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer claimed his party was on course to win the next general election, expected next year.\n\nThe Tories lost 48 councils and more than 1,000 councillors across England in Thursday's polls, exceeding their worst predictions.\n\nMany Tories were angry at the scale of the losses, with some blaming Mr Sunak.\n\nLabour says it is now the largest party in local government, surpassing the Tories for the first time since 2002.\n\n\"The British public has sent a clear rejection of a prime minister who never had a mandate to begin with,\" a Labour spokesperson said.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats had what their leader Sir Ed Davey said was their \"best result in decades\", taking control of 12 councils, mostly in Tory heartlands. The party gained 405 new councillors, compared with Labour's 536 gains.\n\nThe Green Party gained 241 seats - their best-ever result in local elections - and gained its first majority on an English council, in Mid-Suffolk, although they were overtaken as the biggest party by Labour in Brighton and Hove.\n\nMr Sunak admitted the results were \"disappointing\", but said he did not detect \"a massive groundswell of movement towards the Labour Party or excitement for its agenda\".\n\nSir Keir claimed the \"fantastic\" results showed his party was well placed to oust the Tories from government in a general election, expected next year.\n\n\"Make no mistake, we are on course for a Labour majority at the next general election,\" he told cheering activists in Medway in Kent, one of the councils his party has wrested from the Tories.\n\nLabour won control of councils in areas that will be crucial battlegrounds in the general election, including Medway, Swindon, Plymouth, Stoke-on-Trent, and East Staffordshire.\n\nThe BBC's projected national vote share put Labour on 35%, the Tories on 26% and the Lib Dems on 20%.\n\nLabour's projected nine-point lead represents its largest over the Conservatives on this measure since the party lost power in 2010.\n\nSir John Curtice, the polling expert, said this year's results were \"only a little short of calamitous for the Conservatives\".\n\nBut the BBC's political editor, Chris Mason, said the results suggested it would be hard for either the Conservatives or Labour to be confident of winning a majority at the next general election.\n\nLabour shadow cabinet member Peter Kyle denied the results, which saw the Lib Dems gain nearly as many new councillors as Labour, was an anti-government, rather than a pro-Labour, vote.\n\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the results showed Labour had won back support in \"key places\" and would win an outright majority at the general election, without needing to do deals with other parties.\n\n\"In all of the areas that the Labour Party targeted, that we focused resources, that we really wanted to reconnect to voters, we did so.\"\n\nHe added that Sir Keir Starmer had \"led from the front\" and Labour had run a \"disciplined\" campaign, which showed it was \"moving towards government.\"\n\nIn Swindon, where Labour took control of the borough council for the first time in 20 years, ousted Tory council leader David Renard blamed \"the cost of living and the performance of the government in the last 12 months\" for his party's woes locally.\n\nMr Renard said although the prime minister had \"started to stabilise things\", for voters in Swindon \"what had gone on before that was something that they didn't like\".\n\nDavid Renard, Swindon's former council leader, who lost his own seat\n\nThe Conservative mayor of the Tees Valley, Ben Houchen, who is up for election next year, said the poor Tory performance was a partly a result of \"the turmoil and upheaval of the last 12 months\".\n\nHe said Labour had been \"successful in making this a referendum on the government\", adding \"people don't feel like they can vote for us\".\n\nNigel Churchill, a former Tory councillor who lost his seat on Plymouth Council - another Labour target - said \"I think we can safely say\" the Conservatives will lose the next general election.\n\n\"The general public do not trust them at the moment,\" he said.\n\nBut Education Minister Robert Halfon said this year's local elections were always \"going to be difficult\" for his party.\n\nHe said internal party divisions \"didn't help\", but claimed the losses were down to external factors, such as the cost-of-living crisis and problems in the NHS.\n\n\"Every government during the mid-term, especially a government that has been in power for 13 years, always suffers losses in local elections,\" he said.\n\nOther Tory MPs told the BBC that apathy - Conservative voters staying at home - was also a big problem for the party.\n\nThe seats up for grabs were mostly on district councils, responsible for services including bin collections, parks, public housing and planning applications.\n\nThe rest of the elections were for a mixture of metropolitan and unitary councils - single local authorities that deal with all local services - and for four mayors.\n\nThe elections were the first in England to see voter ID checks at polling stations.

says he is confident that former senior civil servant Sue Gray has not broken any rules in talking to Labour about a role.\n\nMs Gray was offered a job as the Labour leader's chief of staff in March.\n\nSir Keir also said he did not have any discussions with Ms Gray while she was investigating former PM Boris Johnson.\n\nThe Cabinet Office will update MPs later on its investigation into the circumstances around her resignation with a written statement.\n\nThe report is not expected to be the final judgement on Ms Gray's departure, which will come from the independent Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba).\n\nThe watchdog is to recommend how long Ms Gray, who probed lockdown gatherings in Downing Street, should wait before being allowed to take up the job with Labour.\n\nSir Keir accused the government of using the issue to try and deflect from the local election campaign, saying it should be focusing on the cost-of-living crisis instead.\n\n\"[The public are] not sitting at their breakfast talking about Sue Gray, they're talking about their bills,\" he told BBC Breakfast.\n\nAsked whether Ms Gray had broken any code of conduct, Sir Keir said: \"Firstly I had no discussions with her whilst she was investigating Boris Johnson whatsoever.\"\n\nHe added: \"I'm confident she hasn't broken any of the rules.\"\n\nUnder the civil service code, officials of Ms Gray's seniority must wait a minimum of three months before taking up outside employment.\n\nSenior civil servants, as well as ministers, are expected to check with Acoba about any employment they wish to take within two years of leaving government.\n\nThe body provides advice and can recommend a delay of up to two years in starting a new job, but it has no power to block appointments.\n\nHowever, Labour has said the party and Ms Gray will abide by its recommendations.\n\nA long delay could hamper attempts to have Ms Gray in place well before the next general election, which is widely expected next year, to help Labour prepare for government if it wins power.\n\nCabinet Office Minister Jeremy Quin has previously said Ms Gray's talks with Labour may have breached civil service rules, including the requirement to inform Acoba before a job offer is announced, and to clear contact with opposition parties with ministers.\n\nMs Gray became well known after she was chosen to look into the Partygate scandal last year.\n\nShe has held a number of senior positions, including head of the government's propriety and ethics team, since joining the civil service in the 1970s.\n\nMs Gray resigned from the post of second permanent secretary in the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities in March, after it emerged she had been offered a job with

investigation when he was in power was an attempt to smear him.\n\nHer report was critical of the senior political and civil service leadership, saying they \"must bear responsibility\" for the

court he is suing the publisher of the Daily Mirror to stop \"absolute intrusion and hate\" towards him and his wife.\n\nPrince Harry was giving evidence against Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) over illegal newsgathering claims, including phone hacking.\n\nHe was choked-up as he finished giving evidence for a second day, and said it had been \"a lot\".\n\nMGN denies it used illegal methods to gather stories about the prince.\n\nAt London's High Court, the prince explained he started discussions about possible legal action after a chance-meeting in France in 2018 with David Sherborne, now his barrister.\n\nThe prince said before then he had no concerns over any particular newspaper stories due to unlawful activity because it \"was all contained in the Palace\".\n\nWhen asked about his discussions with lawyers after that chance meeting with Mr Sherborne, Prince Harry said he had wanted to put a stop to the \"absolute intrusion and hate that was coming towards\" him and the Duchess of Sussex.\n\nHe said he also wanted to \"see if there was any way to find a different course of action, rather than relying on the Institution's way\".\n\nBut in cross-examination, Andrew Green KC, the lawyer representing the publisher of the Mirror, Sunday Mirror and The People, suggested Harry had not found a single story that came from phone hacking.\n\nHarry replied \"there is hard evidence to suggest an incredible amount of suspiciousness\" over how stories were sourced and he believed burner phones were used \"extensively\", referring to phones that can be disposed of so no records are kept.\n\nPrince Harry alleges about 140 articles published between 1996 and 2010 - from his childhood into early adulthood - contained information gathered using unlawful methods, with a sample of 33 stories written about him being considered by the civil court.\n\nMany of the stories the prince claimed were obtained illegally concerned his relationship with his ex-girlfriend Chelsy Davy.\n\nIn a 2006 Sunday People article Ms Davy was said to have been \"screaming for half an hour\" at him on the phone and \"blew her top\" over his visit to a Spearmint Rhino lap dancing club in Berkshire.\n\nChelsy Davy and Prince Harry were in an on-off relationship between 2004 and 2010\n\nAsked where he thought the information on her screaming had come from, the prince said: \"At this point, knowing that my girlfriend's number was bizarrely in the hands of Mirror journalists, that they probably looked through her call data and saw missed calls, late calls\u2026 and managed to put together a story based on that.\"\n\n\"It was very suspicious that they had her number,\" he added, and he did not believe she would have given the Mirror Group or any journalists her phone number.\n\nThe prince told the court he once found a tracking device on Ms Davy's car at a time when the press were reporting on what was described as a \"make-or-break\" holiday for the couple.\n\nHe also highlighted another article in The People in 2007 which reported a \"Palace source\" saying the couple had been having \"monumental\" rows and their relationship was \"in crisis after a string of bitter bust-ups\". Again he said it was \"incredibly suspicious\" as he had never discussed his relationship with the Palace.\n\nMr Green responded by saying we are in the \"land of total speculation about where this information might have come from\".\n\nThe couple broke up in 2010 after a six-year on-off relationship. She attended the prince's wedding to Meghan in Windsor in 2018.\n\nThe prince was also asked about The People publishing photographs of the prince, a friend Mark Dyer and the late TV presenter Caroline Flack meeting up.\n\nAt the time he suspected one of his friends had leaked the details after they were confronted by photographers. In turn this led him and his brother William to stop talking to Mr Dyer for some time afterwards.\n\nHowever he said: \"I now believe the information came from our voicemails\u2026 Even those I trusted the most, I ended up doubting.\"\n\nAsked how he would react if the court concluded that he had never been hacked by any MGN journalist, Harry said that he had been hacked on an \"industrial scale\" and he would \"feel some injustice\" if he did not win the trial.\n\nAfter Prince Harry's evidence concluded, he stayed to see the Daily Mirror's former royal correspondent Jane Kerr give her evidence.\n\nShe had been a royal reporter for the newspaper and later royal correspondent for a decade up to 2007 and wrote a number of the articles under scrutiny in the case.\n\nIn her written witness statement, she denied voicemail hacking or using private investigators to carry out unlawful information gathering.\n\nAsked about her use of private investigators, Ms Kerr told the court she had \"no reason to believe\" details for stories had been obtained unlawfully.\n\n\"These were people who were well known to the news desk, I did not think there was anything wrong with using them,\" she said.\n\nThree other people are also bringing claims against MGN in this case - Coronation Street actors Michael Turner, known professionally as Michael Le Vell, and Nikki Sanderson, as well as Fiona Wightman, the ex-wife of comedian Paul Whitehouse.\n\nThe claimants allege unlawful methods were used to obtain information for stories and say senior executives must have known about it and failed to stop it, which MGN denies.\n\nThe publisher has either denied or not admitted each of the claims. MGN also argues that some of the claimants have brought their legal action too late.", "A major multi-agency search is under way for Ausra Plungiene who was last seen on Tuesday morning\n\nMore than 60 rescue team volunteers have resumed the search across Eryri for a missing dog walker.\n\nAusra Plungiene, 56, from Prestatyn, Denbighshire, set off with her black Swedish lapphund in the mountains above the Conwy Valley on Tuesday morning.\n\nThe search was paused at 20:00 BST on Wednesday, but resumed on Thursday.\n\nTwo possible sightings were also being investigated, North Wales Police said, with a senior officer adding that the search area was almost 14 sq miles.\n\nThe force said Ms Plungiene is an experienced mountain walker who was well equipped for the conditions.\n\nSpecially trained officers are supporting her family as the search across the national park - also known as Snowdonia - continues.\n\nSupt Owain Llewellyn said: \"We are desperately concerned about Ausra's wellbeing, as are her family.\n\n\"A large search involving several organisations has been taking place all day in the mountains above Rowen until we lost the light in the evening.\n\n\"Sixty-five volunteers, including members of the RAF Mountain Rescue Service, had been out on the hills \"in some extremely challenging conditions.\n\n\"The search area now extends to 36 sq km, a huge area which is providing a real challenge to the team.\n\n\"The search is focusing on the mountain area south of Rowen in the Conwy Valley sort of heading towards Llwellyn and encompassing a number of mountain peaks there.\n\n\"It's an absolutely horrendous situation for the family.\"\n\nVideo posted on Twitter showed snow and ice on the ground and strong winds in the area on Wednesday.\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

He anglicised the family name to Lawson in June 1925.\n\nThe young Nigel followed his father's footsteps to Westminster School before going to Oxford from where he graduated with a first-class honours degree in philosophy, politics and economics.\n\nAfter completing his national service in the Royal Navy, where he commanded a fast patrol boat, he went into journalism.\n\nHe began on the Financial Times, where he wrote the Lex column before moving to the Sunday Telegraph where he became City editor.\n\nIn 1966, Lawson became editor of the Spectator magazine. He trod a fairly liberal line, including opposition to the war in Vietnam. He also made regular appearances as a pundit and interviewer on BBC television.\n\nHe unsuccessfully contested the Labour seat of Eton and Slough in the 1970 general election, eventually entering Parliament as member for the Conservative stronghold of Blaby, now known as South Leicestershire, in February 1974.\n\nWith Ted Heath losing that election, Lawson found himself on the opposition benches.\n\nAs a Conservative whip, he struck up an unlikely alliance with Labour left-wingers Jeff Rooker and Audrey Wise, to amend the 1977 budget to index-link tax thresholds to prevent them being eroded by the then high rates of inflation.\n\nWhen Margaret Thatcher entered Downing Street in May 1979, Lawson was appointed financial secretary to the Treasury.\n\nHe worked with Geoffrey Howe before replacing him in the Treasury\n\nHe quickly demonstrated his energy and thirst for reform, playing a leading part in the government's abolition of exchange controls, which led to a free movement of currency to and from the UK.\n\nIn September 1981, he was promoted to energy secretary, where he was immediately thrown into conflict with the miners' unions.\n\nLosses in the coal industry, due to uneconomic pits, were rising but he was aware that any attempt to tackle this would see a repeat of the miners' strike that had brought down the Heath government\n\nUnder Lawson's leadership, the government stockpiled coal and converted some coal-burning power stations to oil, moves which were crucial in the government's eventual victory over the mining unions.\n\nLawson also laid the foundations for the privatisation of British Gas, British Airways and British Telecom. \"We are seeing the birth of people's capitalism,\" he said.\n\nFollowing the Conservative election victory in 1983, Lawson replaced Geoffrey Howe as chancellor and immediately set out on a wide-ranging programme of tax reform.\n\nThere were changes to corporate tax in the 1984 Budget, while a year later he signalled a move from direct to indirect taxation by reducing national insurance contributions for the lower paid and increasing the scope of VAT.\n\nDuring his period in office, the basic rate of income tax was lowered to 25% while the top rate came down from 60% to 40%. Lawson also turned a budget deficit of \u00a310.5bn when he took office to a surplus of \u00a34.1bn when he resigned in 1989.\n\nOn 27 October 1986 came the deregulation of London's financial markets, dubbed the Big Bang. While this strengthened the City of London as an economic powerhouse, Lawson later conceded that it did pave the way for the global financial crisis of 2007 by loosening the restrictions on the ability of banks to lend.\n\nDuring Lawson's time at the Treasury, unemployment continued to fall but inflation began to rise, due, as Lawson later admitted, to his failure to keep a tight grip on interest rates,\n\n\"I should have tightened monetary policy at an earlier stage,\" he later said.\n\nHe was a fierce opponent of the European Economic Community's move towards monetary union. \"It is clear that implies political union,\" he said. \"The United States of Europe. That is simply not on the agenda.\"\n\nBut despite his success, his relationship with the prime minister was deteriorating. He opposed the introduction of the community charge, or poll tax as it came to be known, but was over-ruled by Thatcher.\n\nHe also fell out with the prime minister's financial guru, Sir Alan Walters.\n\nMargaret Thatcher turned to Sir Alan Walters for economic advice - putting strain on her relationship with her chancellor\n\nWhen a public row erupted over his continued support for the exchange rate mechanism Lawson finally resigned in October 1989 and was replaced by John Major.\n\nHis was the second longest tenure of a chancellor in the 20th Century after David Lloyd George.\n\nHis sudden departure, followed closely by that of Walters, raised questions about the government's financial policies and was seen by many as the beginning of the end of Margaret Thatcher's term in office.\n\nIn 1992, he was created Baron Lawson of Blaby. By this time, he had gone on a crash diet, his familiar portly figure reduced by five stone, and published the Nigel Lawson Diet Book.\n\nIn 2004, he re-emerged as a fierce critic of the concept of man-made climate change. He was one of six signatories to a letter condemning the Kyoto Protocol, which committed countries to reduce carbon emissions.\n\nHe followed this up in 2008 with a book entitled, An Appeal to Reason: A Cool Look at Global Warming, a work which one critic described as \"largely one of misleading messages\".\n\nIn later years he became a fierce critic of the concept of man-made climate change\n\n\"There is a lot in this debate that is about playing the man not the ball,\" he complained.\n\nHe went on to form a think tank, the Global Warming Policy Foundation, to continue to challenge the widely accepted scientific consensus on the issue.\n\n\"The policy of this government,\" he said in 2010, \"is crazy and damaging. It is complete nonsense to say that carbon dioxide is a pollutant - it is not.\"\n\nAlways a Eurosceptic, Lawson backed the UK leaving the European Union in the 2016 Brexit referendum, serving on the organising committee of the Vote Leave campaign group.\n\nLawson, who lived in France for many years, insisted that the UK was not turning its back on Europe but reasserting sovereignty that had been given away by successive governments, including the one he served in.\n\nIn what turned out to be his last speech in the Lords in April 2019, he suggested Parliament's \"refusal to accept the people's judgement\" was causing a damaging rift in the country.\n\n\"There is a real danger that undesirable but very often understandable insurrectionary forces will feel that they cannot trust the British Parliament or the British constitution, and a very ugly situation could well arise,\" he warned.\n\nLawson married Vanessa Salmon, whose family owned the Lyons Corner House firm, in 1955 and the couple had four children, including Dominic, who became a journalist, and Nigella, who found fame as a TV cook and food writer.\n\nThe couple divorced in 1980 and Lawson subsequently married Commons researcher Therese Maclear. The couple, who had two children together, separated in 2008.", "The US government has ordered all non-emergency staff to leave the island\n\nAn American nurse and her child have been kidnapped in Haiti, according to a Christian aid charity she worked for.\n\nAlix Dorsainvil was working in a community ministry near Port-au-Prince when she was taken, El Roi Haiti said in a statement.\n\nThe US State Department is aware of reports and is in \"regular contact\" with Haitian authorities.\n\nOfficials in Haiti have appealed to the international community to help break the grip of armed gangs on the country.\n\nMs Dorsainvil is understood to be the wife of El Roi Haiti's director and founder, Sandro Dorsainvil.\n\nThe age and gender of the child is not known.\n\n\"Alix is a deeply compassionate and loving person who considers Haiti her home and the Haitian people her friends and family,\" the statement from El Roi Haiti added.\n\nThe charity also said it was working to secure the pair's safe return.\n\nThe organisation has asked people to \"refrain from speculating on social media about this situation in order to protect Alix and her child during this time\".\n\nThe incident comes days after the US issued a level-four \"do not travel\" advisory because of kidnapping, crime, civil unrest, and 'poor health care infrastructure' on the island.\n\nThe US State Department ordered all non-emergency government personnel and their family members to leave Haiti.\n\nProject Dynamo, a US veteran-led non-profit that evacuates American civilians from risky situations abroad, has said it will go to Haiti to evacuate Americans.\n\nThe poorest country in the Americas has been in political crisis since the assassination of President Jovenel Moise in 2021.\n\nGangs control around 80 percent of the capital, and violent crimes such as kidnappings and armed robbery are common.\n\nEarlier this month, the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, called for the creation of a multinational force for Haiti.\n\nKenya has offered to take the lead, by offering 1,000 police officers to help train local law enforcement.\n\nAny mission will be subject to a mandate from the UN Security Council, and formal authorisation from the Kenyan authorities.\n\nKenya's Foreign Minister Alfred Mutua said any potential multinational force's job would be to stabilise the situation on the ground and empower local authorities, as the people of Haiti have \"suffered enough\".\n\nSpeaking to the BBC's Newshour programme on Sunday, he added Kenya's main aim would be to train Haitian police to help reduce violence and allow humanitarian aid to reach civilians being \"held hostage by gangs\".\n\n\"We have decided to lead this process because we don't want to wait for others,\" Mr Mutua said.", "The government does not want Sats tests to be \"too hard for children\", England's schools minister has said - after claims a Year 6 reading paper was so difficult it left pupils in tears.\n\nNick Gibb said the assessments had to \"test a range of ability\" but he would look at the paper because of the concerns.\n\nHe said he looked at the tests each year once they were publicly available.\n\nThere is no suggestion there will be any kind of formal review.\n\nLast week, one head teacher said the reading test included some \"GCSE-level\" questions.\n\nIt has fuelled a debate among teachers and parents about the purpose of Sats.\n\nThe Department for Education (DfE) previously told BBC News that Sats were \"designed to be challenging\".\n\nMinisters will not have access to the reading paper before it becomes publicly available next week.\n\nMr Gibb said the Standards and Testing Agency (STA) - which is part of the DfE - tested the paper last year \"with a large group of children\".\n\n\"They monitored the response of those children to the test, to the questions, they found that 85% [enjoyed] taking the test,\" he said.\n\nHe said Sats \"do have to test a range of ability to make sure that we can show what proportion of children are exceeding the standard\".\n\n\"But we don't want these tests to be too hard for children. That's not the purpose,\" he said.\n\n\"The purpose is to test the range of ability and the Standards and Testing Agency is charged with making sure that these tests are appropriate for this age group.\"\n\nHe added: \"I will certainly look at this because I know that there has been concern expressed by some schools.\"\n\nStandard Assessment Tests, or Sats, are tests that children take in Year 6, at the end of Key Stage 2. They are national curriculum assessments in English grammar, punctuation and spelling, English reading and maths.\n\nThe government's Standards and Testing Agency says the purpose of Sats tests are to:\n\nChildren also sit Sats in Year 2, at the end of Key Stage 1.\n\nLast year, 59% of Year 6 pupils met the expected levels in reading, writing and maths - down from 65% in 2019.\n\nThe national curriculum tests were cancelled in 2020 and 2021, during the pandemic.", "No service is running on any of the Tube lines\n\nLondoners are facing widespread transport disruption as strike action halts the Underground.\n\nTransport for London's (TfL) website shows no services are running on any Tube lines.\n\nRMT and Aslef members are involved in a dispute over job cuts, pensions and conditions.

The roots of it actually lie in the pandemic and the loss of passengers.\n\nThen the government bailed out Transport for London (TfL) financially but there were strings attached.\n\nBroadly TfL has to make \u00a3900m savings. Some 600 posts are being closed - the unions say that will leave stations with fewer staff which they say isn't safe.\n\nTfL says passenger safety is always a priority. And the crucial issue: TfL has had to carry out a pension review.\n\nEven carrying out the review has sparked the strikes, even though proposals for any change haven't been outlined. Changes will have to be agreed with the government.\n\nPensions are a red line for the unions and it is difficult to see how this will be resolved unless they stay as they are.\n\nFollow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

You won't like what I've got to say. People like you kill if you tell them the truth,\" said one social media user who claimed to be from the port city.\n\nRussian forces put the people of Mariupol through a horrific months-long siege, before finally capturing it last May.\n\nI eventually found three residents willing to speak to me at length: a local city councillor, a retired pensioner and an engineer. All spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing reprisals from the local authorities installed by Russia (who block access to occupied Ukraine by Western journalists).\n\nThey paint a picture of a massively expensive campaign conducted by Russia to win over the hearts and minds of the people of Mariupol, and rebuild a city damaged beyond recognition by Russia's own troops.\n\nThe purpose of this campaign is to assimilate Mariupol and make it Russia's own.\n\nTheir accounts corroborate each other, and are confirmed by social media posts about recent developments in Mariupol.\n\nBefore this war began about half a million people lived in the city.\n\nAccording to UN estimates, 90% of residential buildings were damaged or destroyed, and 350,000 people were forced to leave after Russia attacked in February 2022.\n\nYour device may not support this visualisation\n\nIt is difficult to estimate the exact number of people killed as a result of the relentless shelling of Mariupol, but Ukrainian authorities say more than 20,000 died there.\n\nRussian-installed authorities in Mariupol say some 300,000 people are now living there.\n\nThe people who spoke to me from Mariupol said their city had been inundated with labourers from across Russia, as well as from Central Asia.\n\nOleg Morgun, the Russia-installed \"mayor\" of Mariupol, says some 70,000 of those currently in the city are construction workers and members of the Russian military.\n\nNew buildings have appeared and many buildings damaged during the bombardment have gone.\n\nFor example, the Russian military has built a whole new district comprised of a dozen apartment blocks in the western part of Mariupol. It is called Nevsky, after the River Neva, on which President Vladimir Putin's home city of St Petersburg stands. According to Russian state media, St Petersburg is the main sponsor of the reconstruction of Mariupol.\n\nRussia is building new housing to replace what it destroyed\n\n\"It says on the bus: St Petersburg and Mariupol are twinned cities. There are slogans everywhere telling us that we're part of Russia now,\" pensioner Maria (not her real name) told me.\n\n\"I liked things the way they used to be. Now we live in fear. We have no idea what to expect.\"\n\nIn the houses that escaped relatively unscathed after months of fierce fighting, the Russians are replacing windows, radiators and sometimes heating and sewage pipes.\n\nHeating, running water and electricity supplies have largely been restored. Buses are running and full of passengers again, although the electric trolley bus and tram networks are still out of action.\n\nMany schools, hospitals and shops have reopened as well, although numerous traders are selling their wares straight from the pavement.\n\nMaria was particularly impressed with one school rebuilt under Russian rule: \"It's so beautiful, covered in multi-coloured squares.\" According to her, the number of children in Mariupol now is greater than schools can currently accommodate, so they have classes in two shifts: one in the morning, and another in the afternoon.\n\nRussia has imposed its own Russian-language curriculum in occupied areas - complicating efforts to get children back to school.\n\nShops have reopened and power is back, but many traders are selling their wares on the pavement\n\nThe fast-paced rebuilding of Mariupol has provoked envy in Donetsk, the regional capital occupied by pro-Russian forces since 2014, which has been neglected by comparison.\n\nThe Russia-installed head of the so-called Donetsk People's Republic, Denis Pushilin, has even had to deny rumours that the capital will be moved to Mariupol.\n\nThere are other important ways in which Russia is putting its stamp on Mariupol.\n\nFor example, local residents are under pressure to obtain Russian passports.\n\nIvan, the Mariupol city councillor I spoke to (not his real name), said locals often formed \"huge queues\" trying to get Russian passports.\n\nThey were required if you want to find formal employment, especially with government agencies or in the public sector, he explained.\n\nAlso, they made it possible to travel to Russia without additional stringent checks known as \"filtration\", he added.\n\nUkraine believes 20,000 people died during the siege of Mariupol\n\n\"So they have deliberately created a situation where you get problems if you have Ukrainian papers, you have to deal with red tape, you have to wait. On the other hand, if you get a Russian passport, that's where your problems end: 'You're one of us now'. Things get simpler if you receive a Russian passport,\" Ivan said.\n\nMariupol is also becoming part of Russia's financial system. The Ukrainian currency, the hryvnya, has been phased out, and now the Russian rouble is the only currency accepted in shops.\n\nRussia is channelling huge amounts of money into pension payments for residents of Mariupol, raising them in many cases compared with what they received from the Ukrainian authorities before the war. So residents of Mariupol are able to draw two pensions - one from Russia, another from Ukraine. Naturally, it is a situation many local pensioners are happy with.\n\nRussian pensions are another reason why elderly residents are queuing up to get Russian passports - many pensioners believe the documents will be required in the future to continue receiving payments from Russia.\n\nThe media currently operating in Mariupol are also hard at work promoting a uniformly pro-Russian agenda.\n\nMany current residents of Mariupol are there because they were unable to leave the city when the Russians attacked, due to illness or old age, or because they welcome Russia's presence.\n\n\"We've suffered enough under Ukraine. Now we can breathe again,\" one social media user told me, before breaking off all contact.\n\nNew signs for the city are decked out in the colours of the Russian flag\n\nThe fast-paced campaign of reconstruction and the resulting sense of restored normality, the generous pension payments and the intensive media campaign targeting the people of Mariupol, all stimulate the spread of pro-Russian sentiment in the city.\n\n\"I'm sick of all the propaganda in the papers. They started publishing it from day one, telling us how well things are going,\" said Yuri, the engineer (not his real name). \"I feel out of place in my own city now. People are different, my city feels different now.\"\n\nCity councillor Ivan said: \"It's become difficult for me to say pro-Ukrainian things to my voters. It's tough being pro-Ukrainian in a pro-Russian environment. Unfortunately, Ukraine is losing the hearts and minds of people in Mariupol.\"\n\nThose who are still in Mariupol may be happy to see a degree of normality return to their city, but there are those who suspect Russia of pursuing ulterior motives.\n\nPopular Ukrainian journalist Denys Kazansky argues that Russia uses the new houses it has been building in Mariupol to distract attention from all the destruction it caused in the city and elsewhere in his native Donetsk region.\n\n\"If they destroyed 10 hospitals and then rebuilt one - this isn't reconstruction. It's not something they can be thanked for,\" he said.\n\n\"You can be happy as much as you like about a school being rebuilt, but what do you do with the thousands of people Russia has killed?\" he said.\n\n\"You can't rebuild them. You can't bring them back.\"", "It is the third critical inspection report in a year for Glan Clwyd Hospital's A&E department\n\nA third inspection in a year failed to find any major improvements at a north Wales hospital's emergency department.\n\nStaff at Glan Clwyd Hospital's A&E were said to be working tirelessly to give the best care possible, but the service still requires significant improvement.\n\nInspectors said poor sepsis screening and triage and pain relief delays were putting patients at significant risk.\n\nHealth Minister Eluned Morgan admitted there were still \"very, very serious problems\" at the department.\n\nInspectors' concerns about standards in the department were classified as the most significant, with minimal improvements since their two previous visits.\n\nThe report comes a month after the health board was placed back in special measures following a damning audit report, and 11 independent board members were told to quit by the Welsh government.\n\nHealthcare Inspectorate Wales (HIW) visited the emergency department of the hospital in Bodelwyddan, Denbighshire, in November after previous visits in March and May of 2022.\n\nTheir report again highlights an \"incredibly busy department, struggling with shortages of staff, high numbers of seriously unwell patients and a lack of space to treat them\".\n\nThe same could be said of emergency departments across Wales, but the fact that so little has been done to improve things since two previous visits means it remains under HIW's highest level of scrutiny.\n\nSome speciality doctors refused to review patients in the emergency department, inspectors found\n\nHIW chief executive Alun Jones said: \"This inspection found evidence of a department struggling to cope with the day-to-day demand of providing a safe service to patients.\n\n\"It has highlighted areas such as poor team working between the ED [emergency department] and other departments within the hospital which, in turn, is compounding nationally recognised challenges around patient flow.\n\n\"The health board will need to take strong and decisive action to tackle the issues identified in our inspection. We will continue to engage with the health board to ensure sustained action is taken in relation to our findings.\n\n\"Inspectors found the standard of patient notes had improved, however rotas were challenging as there was a heavy reliance on bank and agency staff because of recruitment and retention issues.\n\n\"While waiting times to see a doctor had improved since May, the flow of patients through the department was still extremely challenging.\n\n\"Waits to see a specialty doctor varied and inspectors found on some occasions those doctors refused to review patients waiting in the ED, leading to further delays.\"\n\nHIW said it would continue to monitor the response of the health board very closely.\n\nThe health board has apologised to patients who may not have received \"the level of care they deserved\".\n\nDr Nick Lyons, executive medical director and interim deputy chief executive of Betsi Cadwaladr health board, noted improvements highlighted by inspectors but acknowledged \"we still have some way to go\" to improve care for all patients.\"\n\n\"It is true staff within the ED at Glan Clwyd Hospital have been under enormous strain for the past three years and this has increased since restrictions eased,\" he said.\n\n\"Attempts to attract permanent members of staff to support the ED's work continues and another recruitment open day is planned within the next few weeks.\n\n\"However, the fragility in staffing and the volume of acutely unwell people we receive each day means we remain a service requiring significant improvement.\n\n\"The vast majority of our colleagues are a credit to our organisation and we value their hard work and professionalism. We will continue to strive to make sure they feel supported by colleagues in other specialties and their hospital management teams.\"\n\nDr Lyons said he noted \"with pride\" inspectors' comments about the commitment of staff, and the satisfaction of the \"majority of patients\" with their care.\n\nHe added: \"Despite the issues raised in the report inspectors acknowledged progress has been made but we know this needs to accelerate.\n\n\"Our colleagues within ED, and in other areas of the hospital, are fully focused on driving this change forward and we are pleased to see the proportion of patients moving through the department within four hours continuing to rise.\"\n\nFollowing publication of the inspection report, Health Minister Eluned Morgan agreed there were \"still very, very serious problems\" at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd and its emergency department \"in particular\".\n\nEluned Morgan: \"There seems to be a specific problem with the emergency department in Ysbyty Glan Clwyd\"\n\nAnswering questions in the Welsh Parliament, the minister said there had been \"serious discussions\" with Dr Lyons \"to ask about what exactly has been put in place\" to improve the situation.\n\n\"There seems to be a specific problem here with the emergency department in Ysbyty Glan Clwyd,\" she said.\n\n\"We've got to encourage\" the department to learn from the other emergency departments within Betsi Cadwaladr health board that are \"working better\", the minister said.\n\nThere had been \"some encouraging improvements after the previous inspection\" but it was \"very disappointing that many of the issues have still not been fully resolved\".\n\nMs Morgan was answering questions from members including Vale of Clwyd Conservative MS Gareth Davies, who later urged Ms Morgan to \"get a grip on the situation\" and \"stop passing the buck\".\n\n\"Patients, along with the people of North Wales, deserve better,\" he added.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nRescue efforts are under way in Mississippi and Alabama after a tornado tore through the two states on Friday night killing 26 people, including a baby and her father.\n\nEmergency services will have to dig through the debris left behind by the tornado, which flattened one town and obliterated homes and businesses.\n\nA state of emergency was declared in Mississippi on Sunday.\n\nAs Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) staff arrived in Mississippi to tour the damage, senator Roger Wicker tweeted: \"Today recovery efforts across our state began in earnest\".\n\nFriday's tornado has been classified as \"violent\" and given a preliminary EF-4 rating - the second-highest rating possible.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Weather Service issued a tornado watch for large sections of both Alabama and Georgia for Sunday, ending at 13:00 ET (18:00 BST).\n\nIn Rolling Fork, crushed cars, bricks and glass litter the streets - the town has been almost entirely wiped out.\n\nOne resident told the BBC he was lucky to survive after seeking shelter in his bath tub.\n\nApproaching the neighbourhood in western Sharkey County, there is little indication of anything unusual.\n\nThe lush farmland that surrounds it is completely untouched, the trees aren't even bent out of shape by wind.\n\nThen, suddenly, you see the houses that were in the tornado's path.\n\nThey have been totally obliterated.\n\nThe tornado seen near the town of Rolling Fork\n\nIn this rural town of only 2,000 people, where one fifth of residents live below the poverty line, dozens of buildings have been flattened by the fury of the tornado.\n\nHomes where family and friends had gathered less than 24 hours before, ready for the weekend, have been reduced to rubble.\n\nTimber frames have been snapped into pieces.

Two others have pleaded not guilty.\n\nProsecutors wrote in court papers that \"for decades the defendant has been selling deadly narcotics: heroin and now heroin laced with fentanyl\".\n\nSentencing judge Ronnie Abrams told Macci that selling the drugs \"not only cost Mr Williams his life, but it's costing your freedom\", the Associated Press news agency reported.\n\nBut it is thought that Macci may have avoided a tougher sentence in part because of a three-page letter filed earlier this month.\n\nIn it Wire co-creator David Simon asked for mercy for the defendant because Williams \"believed in redemption\".\n\n\"No possible good can come from incarcerating a... soul, largely illiterate, who has himself struggled with a lifetime of addiction,\" the letter said.\n\nMr Simon added that Williams himself \"would have fought\" for Macci.\n\nWilliams' nephew Dominic Dupont also told the judge he thought Macci could turn his life around, adding that it \"weighs heavy on me\" to see someone in that situation.\n\nAs overdose deaths in the US continue to rise, some prosecutors have charged victims' friends who helped obtain such drugs, as well as the dealers. Several states have passed laws in recent years allowing prosecutors to charge overdoses as homicides in an effort to discourage people from selling or sharing fentanyl.\n\nWilliams, who talked openly about his struggles with addiction, won critical acclaim for his role in The Wire, a series that ran from 2002-08 and explored the narcotics scene in Baltimore from the perspective of law enforcement as well as drug dealers and users.\n\nProsecutors say that on 5 September 2021, Macci and other members of a drug-trafficking organisation sold Williams heroin laced with fentanyl and continued to sell the substance even after they knew the actor had suffered a fatal overdose.", "Twitter has laid off at least 200 staff in another round of cuts, according to reports in the New York Times.\n\nIt said the tech giant had cut 10% of its current workforce, which it estimated at 2,000 people.\n\nThis is the latest round of job losses at Twitter since chief executive Elon Musk sacked about 50% of its 7,500 employees when he took over in October.\n\nAs staff learned of their fate, Mr Musk tweeted: \"Hope you have a good Sunday.

It will be familiar to many in the commercial sector and it's increasingly the way big tech is going as budgets start to bite.\n\nEsther herself tweeted that it was \"a mistake\" to think that her \"optimism and hard work\" had been a bad decision. \"I'm deeply proud of the team for building through so much noise and chaos,\" she wrote.\n\nShe probably wouldn't have called it \"noise and chaos\" this time last week.\n\nThe Twitter cuts are the latest in a long line of lay-offs in the tech industry over the past few months.\n\nAmazon, Microsoft and Google-owned Alphabet announced tens of thousands of lay-offs between them, but the cuts across the industry are wide-reaching.\n\nAt the end of January, more than 10,000 jobs were lost in eight days across six large tech companies including Spotify, Intel and IBM.\n\nThe Twitter cuts come a month after Reuters reported the firm had made its first interest payment on a bank loan used by Mr Musk to finance the purchase.\n\nHe paid $44bn (\u00a337bn) to take control, with $13bn - a third of the total amount - covered by loans from banks including Morgan Stanley and Barclays.\n\nThese loans are leveraged against Twitter - in other words, the tech company itself is responsible for the loan repayments, not Mr Musk.\n\nReuters reported Twitter paid about $300m to the banks in January.\n\nMeanwhile, there are further indications that the tech company is struggling with financing.\n\nIt is being sued by the Crown Estate in the UK over alleged unpaid rent for its London headquarters, and faces a similar lawsuit in the US over unpaid rent at its San Francisco HQ.\n\nAnd a lawyer representing more than 100 former employees sacked by Twitter told the BBC in February the number of staff launching legal action against the company \"goes up daily\".\n\nMr Musk told this month's World Government Summit in Dubai: \"I think I need to stabilise the organisation and just make sure it's in a financially healthy place.\n\n\"I'm guessing probably towards the end of this year would be good timing to find someone else to run the company, because I think it should be in a stable position around the end of this year.\"", "Temperatures in the final stages of the campaign have hit 40C and millions of voters will be on holiday\n\nSpain is holding a highly unusual election on Sunday at the height of a scorching summer, after four years of left-wing rule.\n\nCurrent Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez called the vote in response to a dismal performance at the May local elections in which his Socialist party came second to main rival, the conservative Popular Party.\n\nNo general election in Spanish history has ever been held so late into the summer, with temperatures topping 40C in this country of 48 million people. The timing of the vote has been criticised when so many in Spain are on holiday, but 2.6 million voters have chosen to cast their ballot by post.\n\nThe Popular Party (PP) under Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o have their eye on victory but may struggle to form a government on their own.\n\nTo win a majority they need to secure more than half the 350 seats in the lower house of parliament. Spaniards will also vote for their upper house.\n\nThe conservatives may need the support of far-right party Vox, while Mr S\u00e1nchez will be able to look to left-wing grouping Sumar.\n\nLGBT and gender issues have become prominent campaign issues in the run-up to this election. Opposition parties PP and Vox have staunchly criticised the left-wing government's new laws on transgender rights - including making it easier for people to change their legal gender - and abortion.\n\nThey have also attacked Spain's controversial \"Only Yes Means Yes\" law on sexual consent. It was passed only last August but created a loophole that cut jail time for over 1,000 convicted rapists - and Mr S\u00e1nchez ended up having to apologise and push through changes.\n\nThe very existence of gender violence has been questioned by some Vox party officials, causing tensions with their potential conservative partners.\n\nNationalism has been a hot issue too. The PP and Vox have labelled Mr S\u00e1nchez a \"traitor\" for pardoning jailed pro-independence leaders and downgrading the crime of secession.\n\nOne highly effective right-wing tactic has involved targeting the prime minister with a slogan for relying on separatists to pass key reforms.\n\nHe has been denounced for his pact with Basque separatist party Bildu, led by Arnaldo Otegi, who was jailed for crimes by the Eta militant group.\n\nThe slogan \"Let Txapote vote for you\" accuses Pedro S\u00e1nchez of relying on the support of separatist killers\n\nThe slogan Que te vote Txapote, meaning \"Let Txapote vote for you\", refers to another Eta militant who carried out a number of deadly terror attacks.\n\nAs Spain experiences worsening droughts and heatwaves, most parties have measures to fight climate change. Only Vox's electoral programme fails to mention the issue entirely.\n\nThe biggest issue for most voters is the economy, even if much of the campaign has focused on other issues. Spain is enjoying a period of growth and inflation slowed to below 2% in June, one of the lowest levels in Europe.\n\nBut dismal jobless figures are one of the opposition's most frequent lines of attack against the current government. In May, Spain had the highest unemployment rate (12.7%) of all EU countries.\n\nPrime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez (L) called the snap election but Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o is favourite to win\n\nHe became the first politician in Spain to snatch power from a sitting prime minister through a no-confidence motion in 2018. Then he narrowly won a confidence vote in January 2020 to form Spain's first coalition government since democracy was restored in the late 1970s.\n\nPedro S\u00e1nchez, 51, is seen as a passionately pro-European integrationist and speaks English fluently; he has lectured in economics in Spain and had a spell working for the UN high representative in Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n\nHis brand of governing has been labelled Sanchismo, and his opponents have styled the election as a choice between Sanchismo or Spain, suggesting he is a threat to the country, its traditions and values.\n\nHe has spearheaded a law to bring dignity to victims of dictator Gen Francisco Franco, backed a rule giving workers the right to menstrual leave and laws expanding abortion rights.\n\nBut this snap election could be a gamble too far, as his party trails his conservative rivals. He has accused the PP of seeking to put Spain in a \"sinister time machine\" with the support of far-right Vox and take the country back to \"who knows where\".\n\nMr Feij\u00f3o has been less than enthusiastic about the prospect of a coalition with the far right\n\nThe Popular Party leader has knowingly cultivated a low-key image, saying recently that \"what for some may be boring, I think for the majority of citizens are qualities that a prime minister should have\".\n\nHe was seen to have won the only head-to-head TV election debate with Mr S\u00e1nchez, telling him he had no right to give lectures on governing pacts because the Socialist leader had relied on separatists.\n\nBut Mr Feij\u00f3o was later criticised for skipping the final televised debate before the election, which was attended by both his opponents, Mr S\u00e1nchez and Ms D\u00edaz, and his potential coalition partner, Santiago Abascal.\n\nA former civil servant born in Galicia in Spain's north-west, he has led the conservatives since 2022.\n\nHe has gained a reputation as a safe pair of hands, serving as president of the former national health service and of the postal service.\n\nHowever, his rivals have highlighted 10-year-old rumours that he had a close friendship with a Galician drug trafficker and money launderer called Marcial Dorado.\n\nPhotographs of the two on holiday together on a yacht in 1995 were unearthed by Spanish daily El Pa\u00eds in 2013.\n\nMr Feij\u00f3o says he was unaware Dorado was a criminal when the two became friends because \"back then we had no internet or Google\". Mr S\u00e1nchez has accused Mr Feij\u00f3o of lying, but the PP leader has hit back accusing him of using \"rubbish\" to seek to discredit him.\n\nSantiago Abascal's party takes a hard line on gay marriage, adoption by gay couples, abortion, euthanasia and transgender rights\n\nHe has led the far-right Vox party he helped found in 2014, and he is known for his controversial declarations. He has said he does not believe in climate change and he has criticised the \"totalitarian law of gender ideology\", which he claims criminalises men.\n\nLast month, he used the riots in France to call for tougher immigration policies. \"Europe is threatened by mobs of anti-Europeans\u2026 who are unwilling to adapt to our way of life and our laws,\" he said. \"Europe cannot continue to accept immigrants from Muslim countries.\"\n\nVox has already reached coalition deals with the conservatives in dozens of cities and three autonomous regions - Extremadura in the west, Valencia in the east and Castille and Le\u00f3n, north of Madrid. In the Balearic Islands, Vox have reached a pact with the PP but have no positions in government.\n\nNow Mr Abascal is looking for a share of national power too.\n\nHe has cultivated strong ties with other European far-right and nationalist groups, from Hungary's ruling Fidesz and France's National Rally to the Brothers of Italy party of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.\n\nMs Meloni has given Vox's election campaign her backing, recording a video to reaffirm the parties' \"great friendship\".\n\nYolanda D\u00edaz has gained popularity in Spain for her headline-grabbing policies\n\nIf Vox are the potential kingmaker for Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, then for the Socialists it would be Yolanda D\u00edaz's Sumar (Unite) alliance of 15 left-wing groups.\n\nA former Communist, she has been Spain's second deputy prime minister as well as labour minister and she is keen to be Spain's first female leader too: \"because women's time has come, and women want to be the ones who make history\".\n\nSumar have made a big pitch for the youth vote, pledging \u20ac20,000 (\u00a317,139) of funding to help 18-23 year-olds to kick-start their lives.\n\nMs D\u00edaz is a popular politician who has helped increase the Spanish minimum wage to \u20ac1,259 and scrapped unpopular labour laws.\n\nSparks flew between Ms Diaz and Mr Abascal in the last televised debate before the election as the two clashed over issues of gender violence, while she and Mr S\u00e1nchez appeared to form a united front.\n\nWhile opinion polls have narrowed, the conservatives and Mr Feij\u00f3o are favourites to win. But they may need to form a coalition with Vox to form a majority and avoid repeat elections.\n\nThe last opinion polls published in Spain put the PP on 33%-36% of the vote and the Socialists on under 29%. Vox and Sumar are almost neck and neck on 12.5-13.5%.\n\nTo win an absolute majority a party needs 176 seats, so no party would win outright with these results.\n\nVox has made great strides in securing power-sharing deals with the conservatives in three autonomous regions, and lesser alliances have been reached in Murcia, Aragon and the Balearic Islands,\n\nBut Mr Feij\u00f3o is less than enthusiastic at the prospect of governing with the far right.\n\nThe PP leader has seemed rattled by his rival's accusations of a \"shameful\" pact with Vox.\n\nIn their TV debate Mr Feij\u00f3o said Vox's Mr Abascal would not be a member of a prospective PP government \"if I don't need the votes\". He even offered the Socialists' Mr S\u00e1nchez a pact for the losing party to support the winner so that neither would need to rely on either the hard right or left.\n\nBut Vox could be the only option. Last month Maria Guardiola, the PP president of the western Extremadura region, said she would never govern with a party that \"dehumanises immigrants\" and that \"rubbishes\" LGBT rights.\n\nShe later changed her mind and welcomed Vox into her government, stating that \"my word is not as important as the future of Extremadura\".\n\nAs well as taking a hard line on gay marriage, adoption by gay couples, abortion, euthanasia and transgender rights, another big issue that has driven support for Vox is its unequivocal stance on opposing Catalan nationalism.\n\nIt has also taken a dim view over the status of Gibraltar, a British overseas territory at the southern end of the Iberian peninsula.\n\nLast year Vox objected to reports of talks between the UK and Spain by warning that \"any agreement that does not go through the recognition of the Spanish sovereignty of Gibraltar is an act of treason against Spain\".", "Kyiv involvement in alleged Kremlin drone attack would be astonishing - think tank\n\nFollowing on from the White House's denial of involvement in the alleged attack on the Kremlin, Prof Michael Clarke from the London-based Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) has been discussing the likelihood of Ukrainian involvement. \"I would be truly astonished if yesterday\u2019s drone attack on the Kremlin was down to Kyiv,\" he tells BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. \"It would be a monumentally stupid thing for them to do and the quickest way for them to lose the war,\" he says. \"If Ukraine is seen to conduct a strategically significant attack inside Russia, then it will lose Western support. And if it loses Western support, it loses the war.\" He says it is possible it is a false flag attack, saying this is an area Russia \"has form\" in. But Clarke says he believes it is more likely to have been carried out by a separate \"freelance\" operative. A false flag is a political or military action carried out with the intention of blaming an opponent for it.", "The parents of a cyclist killed in Glasgow say their daughter would still be alive if Scotland had safer road infrastructure for bikes.\n\nEmma Burke Newman, 22, from Paris died after a crash with a HGV in January.\n\nHer parents, Rose Marie Burke and John Newman, said there should be better separation between cyclists and other road traffic in the city.\n\nThey are backing Pedal on Parliament this weekend -

now in an attacking central midfield role - producing a driving run and expertly timed pass to allow Fishlock the time and space to calmly slot the ball under Doris Bacic.\n\nFishlock was central to Wales' attacking play as they dominated possession and restricted Croatia to defending extremely deeply with 10 players behind the ball at virtually all times.\n\nWales were restricted to half chances after going ahead, with Rowe firing wide and captain Sophie Ingle seeing a shot blocked, but they almost doubled their advantage just before the interval when Hayley Ladd's floating cross picked out Elise Hughes, but she headed over from close-range.\n\nFishlock was not to be denied though and she doubled Wales' lead on 49 minutes, heading home after her initial lobbed effort struck the crossbar - a player so good, she even does one-twos with the woodwork.\n\nThe goals, Fishlock's 41st and 42nd in her 149th game, puts her ahead of Gareth Bale as Wales' second-top scorer, just two goals behind Helen Ward.\n\n\"I think she will break my record by the end of this campaign if not sooner,\" Ward said.\n\n\"She has been an absolute superstar for Wales for so many years.

However, after 10 weeks the procedure is carried out in a clinic.\n\nProsecutors argued Foster had provided false information knowing she was over the time limit and had made online searches which they said indicated \"careful planning\".\n\nThe court heard between February and May 2020 she had searched \"how to hide a pregnancy bump\", \"how to have an abortion without going to the doctor\" and \"how to lose a baby at six months\".\n\nBased on the information she provided the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), she was sent the tablets because it was estimated she was seven weeks pregnant.\n\nThe woman was initially charged with child destruction, the court heard\n\nHer defence argued that lockdown and minimising face-to-face appointments had changed access to healthcare and so instead she had to search for information online.\n\n\"The defendant may well have made use of services had they been available at the time,\" said her barrister Barry White. \"This will haunt her forever.\"\n\nOn 11 May 2020, having taken the abortion pills, an emergency call was made at 18:39 BST saying she was in labour.\n\nThe baby was born not breathing during the phonecall and was confirmed dead about 45 minutes later.\n\nA post-mortem examination recorded the baby girl's cause of death as stillbirth and maternal use of abortion drugs and she was estimated to be between 32 and 34 weeks' gestation.\n\nFoster, from Staffordshire, already had three sons before she became pregnant again in 2019.\n\nThe court heard she had moved back in with her estranged partner at the start of lockdown while carrying another man's baby.\n\nThe judge accepted she was \"in emotional turmoil\" as she sought to hide the pregnancy.\n\nFoster was initially charged with child destruction, which she denied.\n\nShe later pleaded guilty to an alternative charge of section 58 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, administering drugs or using instruments to procure abortion, which was accepted by the prosecution.\n\nSentencing, judge Mr Justice Edward Pepperall said it was a \"tragic\" case, adding that if she had pleaded guilty earlier he may have been able to consider suspending her jail sentence.\n\nHe said the defendant was \"wracked by guilt\" and had suffered depression and said she was a good mother to three children, one of whom has special needs, who would suffer from her imprisonment.\n\nShe received a 28-month sentence, 14 of which will be spent in custody with the remainder on licence.\n\nAhead of Monday's hearing, a letter co-signed by a number of women's health organisations was sent to the court calling for a non-custodial sentence.\n\nHowever, the judge said it was \"not appropriate\" and that his duty was \"to apply the law as provided by Parliament\".\n\nHe told the defendant the letter's authors were \"concerned that your imprisonment might deter other women from accessing telemedical abortion services and other late-gestation women from seeking medical care or from being open and honest with medical professionals\".\n\nBut he said it also \"has the capacity to be seen as special pleading by those who favour wider access to abortions and is, in my judgment, just as inappropriate as it would be for a judge to receive a letter from one of the groups campaigning for more restrictive laws\".\n\nThe sentencing has sparked outcry among women's rights organisations and campaigners.\n\nBPAS said it was \"shocked and appalled\" by the woman's sentence which they said was based on an \"archaic law\".\n\n\"No woman can ever go through this again,\" said its chief executive, Clare Murphy.\n\n\"Over the last three years, there has been an increase in the numbers of women and girls facing the trauma of lengthy police investigations and threatened with up to life imprisonment under our archaic abortion law,\" she said.\n\n\"Vulnerable women in the most incredibly difficult of circumstances deserve more from our legal system.\"\n\nShe said MPs must do more to offer protection so \"no more women in these desperate circumstances are threatened with prison again\".\n\nLabour MP Stella Creasy said \"no other patient group would be treated this way\"\n\n\"The average prison sentence for a violent offence in England is 18 months,\" she said in a tweet.\n\n\"A woman who had an abortion without following correct procedures just got 28 months under an 1868 act -

If it is signed by Tennessee's governor, Republican Bill Lee, it will go into effect on 1 July.\n\nThe bill's backers were spurred on by a government report released last year on solar geoengineering, which is the idea of cooling the planet by reflecting sunlight back into space. The White House, though, has said that there are no plans \"to establish a comprehensive research programme focused on solar radiation modification.\"\n\nSeveral witnesses who testified before the Tennessee legislature cited debunked conspiracy theories or speculated about secret government geoengineering programmes, according to Scott Banbury, conservation director of the state's branch of the Sierra Club, an environmental organisation.\n\nTheir claims were troubling, he said.\n\n\"As a serious environmental organisation, if what was in the bill was actually going on we would be calling for a stop to it,\" he said. \"It's not happening.\"\n\nThe legislation focuses on geoengineering, a very broad category which includes mostly theoretical large-scale action to mitigate climate change.\n\nGeoengineering is controversial even among legitimate climate scientists, because of uncertainty around its usefulness and the possibility of unintended outcomes.\n\nPlanet-wide climate engineering is distinct from more routine weather modification, such as cloud seeding, which increases rainfall over specific areas and is used in several US states.\n\n\"Chemtrails\", meanwhile, is a separate, pseudoscientific idea that governments or corporations are spraying chemicals from planes to kill, control or poison people.\n\nConspiracy theorists point to white plumes of water vapour trailing behind passenger aeroplanes, commonly called contrails, as proof of sinister and secret plots, but lack evidence for their claims.\n\nThe most common claim of proof is \"simply that aircraft contrails look 'different', without any comparative analysis,\" according to a report from a Harvard geoengineering group.\n\n\"This as convincing as saying that alien beings walk among us in disguise as people because some people act very strangely,\" it said.\n\nIn recent decades speculation about chemtrails has risen as the number of airline flights - and thus the number of contrails - has surged.\n\nIn the debate over the Tennessee bill, lawmakers and witnesses cited a range of both reliable and debunked facts about geoengineering and weather modification, and at least one witness said she believed the White House was engaged in climate experiments but could not provide definitive proof.\n\nThe legislation's sponsor, Monty Fritts, called it \"a very common-sense thing to do\".\n\nAlthough several lawmakers mentioned chemtrails while the bill was being discussed, during Monday's session Mr Fritts focused on cloud seeding.\n\n\"Everything that goes up must come down, and those chemicals that we knowingly and willingly inject into the atmosphere simply to control the weather or the climate are affecting our health,\" he said.\n\nIn a joking response, John Ray Clemmons, a Democrat from Nashville, introduced an amendment that would protect fictional beasts.\n\n\"This amendment would make sure that we are protecting yetis, or Sasquatch or Bigfoot, from whatever this conspiracy is that we're passing in this legislation,\" he said during debate.\n\nJohn Ray Clemmons introduced an amendment designed to poke fun at the bill\n\n\"This legislation is not to be taken seriously,\" he said.\n\nMr Clemmons told the BBC that several of his fellow lawmakers believe in QAnon theories and conspiracies about vaccines being hidden in food.\n\n\"This is unfortunately nothing new,\" he said. \"There's a lot of things we could be doing to reduce living costs for our working families, but we are wasting time with this.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Mr Fritts said: \"Nothing that helps ensure that our air, water, and soil are cleaner could be a waste of time.\"\n\n\"We cannot change what people believe,\" the spokesperson said about the persistent conspiracy theory allegations. \"We can only present the information and let them make up their own minds.\"\n\nAlthough the Tennessee bill appears to be the first of its kind to pass a state legislature, lawmakers in several other states including Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Kentucky, Minnesota and New Hampshire have introduced similar legislation.\n\nMr Banbury, the Sierra Club official, noted that witnesses supporting the bill travelled from outside Tennessee, and several have testified in favour of similar laws in other states.\n\n\"As a grassroots organiser I'm impressed that a cadre of the same people have had such influence, and that they can muster up so much power,\" he said.", "Jennifer Lawrence, pictured in late 2022, is the producer on a new documentary called Bread and Roses, which explores the day-to-day lives of three women in Afghanistan\n\n\"You only oppress women,\" the young woman says to the Taliban fighter.\n\n\"I told you not to talk,\" he shouts back, \"I will kill you right here!\"\n\n\"Okay, kill me!\" she replies, raising her voice to match his. \"You closed schools and universities! It's better to kill me!\"\n\nA camera phone has secretly, and shakily, captured this direct confrontation inside a car between the woman and the militant.\n\nShe had just been arrested following a protest and was about to be taken to a holding cell in Kabul.\n\nIt is a scene from the documentary Bread and Roses, which explores the day-to-day lives of three women in the weeks following the takeover.\n\nThe producer is the Oscar-winning actress, Jennifer Lawrence, who is telling the BBC why this moment in the film is so significant to her.\n\n\"My heart was beating so fast watching these women defy the Taliban,\" Lawrence says. \"You don't see this side of the story, women fighting back, in the news every day and it's an important part of our film, and the stories of these women.\"\n\nShe says it is devastating to think about the sudden loss of control Afghan women have endured.\n\n\"They currently have no autonomy within their country. It is so important for them to be given the opportunity to document their own story, in their own way.\"\n\nThe film has been made by Excellent Cadaver, the production company Lawrence set up in 2018 with her friend Justine Ciarrocchi.\n\n\"This documentary was born out of emotion and necessity,\" says Lawrence, who describes feeling helpless and frustrated about what she was seeing on the news.\n\nCiarrocchi says that Lawrence \"had a seismic reaction to the fall of Kabul in 2021 because the circumstances were so dire for women\".\n\n\"And she said, 'We've got to give somebody a platform to tell this story in a meaningful way.'\"\n\nThat somebody was Sahra Mani, a documentary maker who co-founded the independent Kabul production company, Afghan Doc House.\n\n(l-r) Director of Bread and Roses, Sahra Mani, editor Hayedeh Safiyar, Jennifer Lawrence and Justine Ciarrocchi.\n\nBoth Lawrence and Ciarrocchi had watched her critically acclaimed documentary A Thousand Girls Like Me, which profiles a 23-year-old Afghan woman who goes on national television to expose sexual abuse by her father, after being ignored by her family and the police.\n\nCiarrocchi tracked down Mani, who said that she had already begun a project, following three women in the country as they tried to establish some kind of autonomy in the months following the Taliban takeover, as girls and women were barred from universities and schools.\n\nMani filmed using covert cameras, and even asked the women to film themselves at safehouses with their friends and families.\n\nAnother sequence captures a secret meeting in a windowless basement, off a side street in Kabul. More than a dozen women sit in rows of desks and chairs, arranged like a makeshift classroom. Steam rises from the drinks in their plastic cups.\n\nThey do not know each other, but all are from different groups who protested after the Taliban retook Afghanistan in August 2021.\n\nOne of the women, a dentist called Zahra, has led the viewer to this secret meeting. When she speaks to the group, she reminisces about wearing high heels and perfume and going to the park with her friends. The women around her smile.\n\nBread and Roses was secretly filmed with the use of multiple covert cameras in the weeks following the fall of Kabul.\n\n\"Women must write their own history,\" Vahideh says passionately to the group, to murmurs of agreement. \"Women are not properly celebrated around the world.\"\n\nMani was well aware of the challenges of filming in such private and dangerous situations.\n\n\"I understand how to deal with difficulties because I am one of them.\n\n\"They are not victims,\" she says, \"they are heroes.\"\n\nBut getting the balance right between keeping the women safe and telling their story was not easy. She tells the BBC that there were several late-night conversations between her, Ciarrocchi and Lawrence during the production process.\n\n\"They were there whenever I faced any issues or problems,\" Mani says. \"When women unite, everything is possible.\"\n\nJennifer Lawrence pictured with director Sahra Mani and producer Justine Ciarrocchi at the Cannes film festival\n\nWith Mani and the other women featured now all out of the country, the producers felt comfortable submitting Bread and Roses for wider distribution, starting at Cannes.\n\nCiarrocchi and Lawrence say their next challenge is to get the film in front of a large audience - not always easy when the story is a snapshot of an ongoing and devastating conflict.\n\n\"There's not an end to this story,\" says Lawrence, \"and you feel pretty much helpless when thinking about how to do anything about it. It's a hard thing to market.\"\n\nAs women executive producers, Ciarrocchi and Lawrence are still in the minority in Hollywood. A 2022 study from the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film showed that women comprised only 24% of directors, writers and producers in the top-grossing films, a decrease from 2021.\n\n\"I think there's a long, long way to go, but I do feel inspired and positive by the end product when you have more diversity in filmmaking,\" says Lawrence. \"It's what people want. The audiences want it.\"\n\nCiarrocchi adds: \"That's why we take the responsibility of Jen's platform so seriously as a woman who's giving opportunities to other women... to employ women, to tell women's stories, to always employ a diverse body of people.\"\n\n\"That's also because I am a woman,\" replies Lawrence.\n\n\"I'm lucky enough to not have the biased idea that women aren't as good at things!\"", "Saudi Arabia cut ties in 2016 after its embassy in Tehran was stormed\n\nMiddle East regional rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia have agreed to restore diplomatic relations, seven years after severing them in a bitter row.\n\nThe unexpected announcement came after four days of talks between officials from both sides in China.\n\nSaudi Arabia cut ties in January 2016 after demonstrators stormed its embassy in Tehran following Riyadh's execution of a prominent Shia Muslim cleric.\n\nTensions between the Sunni and Shia-led neighbours have since often been high.\n\nThey regard each other as a threatening power that seeks regional dominance. They also support rival sides across the Middle East, including in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq - and most overtly in Yemen.\n\nIran has supported Shia Houthi rebels who forced out the Saudi-backed government in 2014, while Saudi Arabia has led a devastating air campaign against the Houthis since the following year.\n\nSaudi Arabia has also accused Iran of helping the Houthis attack it.\n\nIn the most serious incident of its kind, drones and missiles struck major Saudi oil facilities in 2019, causing damage and disruption to production. Saudi Arabia and its US ally blamed Iran for the attack - something Iran denied.\n\nPrevious attempts at reconciliation have been unsuccessful, but on Friday the two countries said they would reopen embassies within two months. They will also re-establish trade and security relations.\n\nThe US cautiously welcomed the announcement. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the administration supported \"any effort to de-escalate tensions in the region\". But he added: \"It really does remain to be seen if Iran is going to meet their obligations.\"\n\nThe secretary-general is ready to help efforts \"to ensure durable peace and security in the Gulf region\", his spokesman said.\n\nIsrael, which has called for maximum pressure on Iran over its nuclear programme, has not commented.", "Swedish star Loreen is the bookmaker's favourite to win the contest\n\nSweden's Loreen has sailed through to the grand final of the Eurovision Song Contest, cementing her position as this year's favourite.\n\nThe star, who previously won in 2012, clasped her hands to cover her eyes as it was announced she had qualified from the first semi-final in Liverpool.\n\nIreland were less fortunate, with the rock band Wild Youth on their way home after failing to attract enough votes.\n\nThe country has now failed to qualify on eight of their last 10 attempts.\n\nThe continuation of that losing streak will cause much soul-searching in the nation that holds the record for the most Eurovision victories of all time - seven in total.\n\nThe last time they qualified was 2018, when Ryan O'Shaughnessy entered with his song Together.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

The BBC has spoken to those men sent home, and learnt that some prisoners were offered \u00a31,500 to leave - and some plan to come back.\n\nEach week, a small crowd gathers at the razor-wire fence tucked around the back of Albania's Tirana airport.\n\nThe narrow runway beyond it, pinched between jagged black mountains and the high grey walls of the border police unit, is where UK deportation flights land - closely watched by the families waiting at the fence.\n\nIt takes hours for the deportees to appear, trickling slowly through the gate to be met with hugs, shy smiles and tears.\n\nDeportation flights to Albania have increased since the country signed a joint co-operation agreement with the UK last December, to \"deter and disrupt illegal migration\".\n\nThe UK government's Home Office says more than 1,000 people have been returned since then: around half of them voluntary, the rest a combination of failed asylum seekers and foreign offenders.\n\nThe BBC spoke to dozens of people on several of these deportation flights last month, and found that most came from UK prisons.\n\nSome had been offered money in return for agreeing to deportation, and were released from prison before serving their minimum sentence, under an existing scheme used for foreign offenders.\n\nAlbanian police confirmed that a majority of those forcibly returned this year were convicted of crimes in the UK.\n\nOne cheerful 30-year-old man said he had been serving a six-year sentence for drug offences, and was released for deportation after serving just two of them - a year before he would have been eligible for parole.\n\nHe asked us to hide his identity, so we're calling him Mark.\n\nThe man who we're calling Mark asked the BBC not to identify him\n\n\"The immigration officer came to see us,\" he said. \"They ask if you want to go back [to Albania] or stay in UK. They explained that if you go back, they take one year off from your sentence.\"\n\nMark was also offered \u00a31,500 in financial support to return home, under a separate programme called the Facilitated Return Scheme (FRS).\n\nA UK government document clearly states that the scheme is \"a financial incentive\" offered to foreign prisoners \"on the proviso that they co-operate with deportation and waive their right to appeal against it\".\n\nOther prisoners we spoke to on the deportation flights last month had been given the same amount.\n\nMark was deported under the UK's Early Release Scheme (ERS), used for foreign prisoners of all nationalities.\n\nERS does not require the consent of prisoners, but several Albanian deportees we spoke to, including Mark, said their deportation and sentence reduction were presented as voluntary.\n\n\"It was my choice to come back,\" Mark told me. \"Nobody forced me. They offered it to me. They said, 'You decide if you want to go or want to stay'.\"\n\nWe asked the Home Office to confirm how many Albanians had been deported under the ERS since the start of last year, and how many had received financial incentives to co-operate, but it said it did not publish these statistics.\n\nA spokesperson said in a statement: \"The UK and Albanian governments work together to take every opportunity to intercept the work of people smugglers and speed up the removal of Albanians with no legal right to be in the UK.\"\n\nIn March, Edi Rama (right) became the first Albanian prime minister to visit 10 Downing Street\n\nLast year, the government's Nationality and Borders Act extended the early release period allowed under the ERS from nine months to a year. One of the aims of that change, according to a Home Office brief, was to increase the number of removals.\n\nThe same Act also abolished the expiry date for unserved sentences, meaning that prisoners who return to the UK illegally will have to serve the rest of their sentence, no matter how much time has passed - increasing the deterrent for people like Mark.\n\n\"I'm not going back there again,\" he said. \"I'm not going to prison. Now I'm going to look for work, I'm going to be a good guy.\"\n\nBut several of those on the deportation flights last month said they were planning to return to the UK within weeks or even days, despite what many described as a new hard-line approach by police there.\n\n\"They're rounding up Albanians now,\" one man said. \"It's very difficult for Albanians to stay in the UK because police stop you in the road. They don't want us now.\"\n\nHe said he had been sent back to Albania after police stopped the car he was in and found he was undocumented.\n\nHe is still planning to return.\n\nAnother man said he had already been back and forth to the UK three times. \"It's not a problem for me,\" he said. \"I'll go back whenever I want.\"\n\nFor many of those we spoke to, it was economic opportunities that drew them to the UK.\n\nNot for Azem, though - a slight man in his late twenties, who seemed lost inside his clothes.\n\nAzem - not his real name - talks to the BBC's Lucy Williamson on a disused railway track\n\nAzem - not his real name - told us his story on condition of anonymity. He also insisted we meet somewhere remote, where he wouldn't be overheard.\n\nOn a disused railway track over a pretty river sunk into the rolling landscape outside Tirana, Azem talked, his hands trembling.\n\nHe showed me documents detailing his removal from the UK, and the rejection of his asylum claim. He told immigration officials he had fled Albania after gang members put a gun to his head and threatened to kill him for his political activities.\n\nHe was returned back to Albania against his wishes last month.\n\n\"I'm afraid because the same situation can happen again,\" he said. \"I've stayed quiet, I don't smile, I'm stressed and my body shakes all the time, I don't sleep much.\"\n\nA UK psychologist's report, filed just before Azem's deportation, raised concerns that he may have experienced psychological torture in Albania.\n\nA Home Office response said his experiences had already been considered in his asylum application, and that the decision was unchanged.\n\nAzem told me he wouldn't hesitate to return to the UK illegally if he was threatened again, despite being blacklisted from entering the UK and EU countries. Albanians have free movement to countries like France and Belgium, which offer an easy springboard across the Channel.\n\nAlbanian police have recently stepped up checks at the country's border crossings, to catch blacklisted deportees trying to slip across.\n\nThe increased co-operation between the UK and Albania has coincided with a sharp drop in the number of Albanians arriving in small boats; just 29 were detected in the first few months of this year.\n\nMuch of that drop is likely to be seasonal and with the winter weather now easing, both governments are facing the first real test of their approach to tackling irregular migration.\n\nAlbania's Interior Minister Bledar \u00c7u\u00e7i said those who return are \"free citizens\"\n\nI asked Albania's Interior Minister Bledar \u00c7u\u00e7i what his country was doing to prevent the recent deportees simply returning to the UK.\n\n\"It's not possible to put a chip in everyone to follow where they go,\" he said. \"If there are people with criminal records, especially in trafficking, then police will be on alert. But in general, the people who return are free citizens in Albania.\"\n\nBut alongside work on illegal migration, he said, the two governments needed to work on legal routes for Albanian citizens to reach the UK.\n\n\"I have suggested to my colleague, [UK Home Secretary] Suella Braverman, that we should also create the immediate legalisation of all Albanians who work in [the UK] at an honest job, and who have no criminal record,\" Mr \u00c7u\u00e7i added.\n\nBoth Albania and British governments recognise the economic pull of the UK.\n\nIn the tiny northern-Albanian town of Krum\u00eb, 60% of the population has already gone. The first man I meet on the street there speaks English effortlessly, with a London accent.\n\nLocal politicians say more of the town's voters now live in east London than here at home.\n\nEven those who remain here go to a caf\u00e9 called \"Britain\" for their morning coffee; its entrance adorned with a full-sized London phone box.\n\nThe tiny northern Albanian town of Krum\u00eb features a caf\u00e9 called Britain, with a red phone box outside\n\nThe UK is putting more than \u00a38m into training projects and businesses in Kuk\u00ebs - the region where Krum\u00eb lies - through an organisation that aims to change what it calls the \"cultural norm\" of illegal migration to the UK.\n\nThe Albanian government is also investing in infrastructure here, including a new airport. But locals have so far seen few tangible benefits.\n\nWe meet local mayoral candidate Miftar Dauti at a campaign rally for young people - his arrival greeted by an enthusiastic crowd of young supporters, and a deafening sound system playing a song called Democracy.\n\n\"What's the system where people don't dare to say what they think?\" the lyrics scream. \"Where journalists don't dare to say what's happening? Where the law only applies to you? Democracy, democracy, democracy!\"\n\nA strange choice for an election campaign, perhaps.\n\nMr Dauti is promising to stop the town's young people leaving for the UK. But even here amongst his own young supporters in the village hall, that promise is struggling to land.\n\n\"I want to be back in the UK,\" a lively, baby-faced supporter called Valda told me, as he watched the candidate leave. \"This place isn't for me. I've been in the UK for two years and I want to be back there.\"\n\nAt a local park in Kuk\u00ebs town centre, grandparents watch young children play football beneath the snow-capped mountains, while single-sex groups of teenagers wander along the paths.\n\nLocals say some children here say they want to be migrants when they leave school.\n\nIn one version of Albania's future, British tourists might flock here, transfixed by this region's stunning landscape.\n\nBut as so many young people here will tell you, futures don't happen in Kukes.

Act did not interfere with the rights of the living disabled.\n\nThe campaigner had argued that the rules were discriminatory.\n\nMs Crowter, 27, from Coventry, said she was taking her case to the Strasbourg court \"because it is downright discrimination that people with disabilities are treated differently\".\n\n\"In 2023, we live in a society where disabled people are valued equally after birth but not in the womb,\" she said.\n\nUnder legislation in England, Wales and Scotland, there is a 24-week time limit for abortion, unless \"there is a substantial risk that if the child were born it would suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped\", which includes Down's syndrome.\n\nIn September 2021, High Court judges found the section of the Abortion Act pertaining to the condition to not be unlawful, adding that it aimed to strike a balance between the rights of the unborn child and of women, in a case brought by Ms Crowter and Maire Lea-Wilson

They are regular M&Ms in a nice box,\" he said.\n\nAir Force One, which the White House calls the president's \"office in the sky\", has 4,000 sq feet (372 sq m) of floor space spread over three levels.\n\nIts impressive facilities include an extensive suite for the president, a medical station with an operating table, a conference and dining room, two food preparation galleys that can feed 100 people at a time, and designated areas for the press, VIPs, security and secretarial staff.\n\nWith its advanced avionics and defences, the aircraft is classed as a military aircraft, designed to withstand an air attack.\n\nIt is also capable of refuelling mid-air, allowing it to fly for an unlimited time - crucial in an emergency.\n\nAir Force One is also equipped with secure communications equipment, allowing the aircraft to function as a mobile command centre.\n\nThere are 85 onboard telephones, a collection of two-way radios and computer connections.\n\nThe president sits up front, while journalists are stationed towards the rear of the plane.\n\u2022 None Special M&Ms and James Bond - a trip on Air Force One", "The Euclid telescope has successfully launched into space on a mission to understand some of the Universe's greatest mysteries.\n\nThe \u20ac1.4bn (\u00a31.2bn) telescope was primed to go up on a Falcon-9 rocket from Cape Canaveral in Florida on Saturday.\n\nEuclid's goal is to make an immense 3D map of the cosmos in a bid to better understand so-called dark matter and dark energy.\n\nResearchers know virtually nothing about these phenomena, which appear to control the structure and expansion of the cosmos.\n\nAlthough primarily a European Space Agency project, the mission also has significant scientific and engineering inputs from the US space agency Nasa.\n\nEuclid will carry out its work from an observing position on the opposite side of our planet to the Sun.", "There have been calls for Orkney to become part of Norway\n\nOrkney councillors have voted to investigate alternative methods of governance amid deep frustrations over funding and opportunities.\n\nCouncil leader James Stockan said the islands had been \"held down\" and accused the Scottish and UK governments of discrimination.\n\nHis motion led to media speculation that Orkney could leave the UK or become a self-governing territory of Norway.\n\nIt was supported by 15 votes to six.\n\nIt means council officers have been asked to publish a report to Orkney's chief executive on options of governance.\n\nThis includes looking at the \"Nordic connections\" of the archipelago and crown dependencies such as Jersey and Guernsey.\n\nA further change which would see the revival of a consultative group on constitutional reform for the islands was accepted without the need for a vote.\n\nOn Monday, the prime minister's spokesperson rejected the suggestion the islands could loosen its ties with the union.\n\nMr Stockan urged councillors to back his idea to find new ways to get greater financial security and economic opportunities for Orcadians.\n\nSpeaking to councillors on Tuesday, he said the motion was \"not about us joining Norway\".\n\nHe added: \"I say it's time for government to take us seriously and I say it's time for us to look at all the options we've got.\n\n\"There is a far bigger suite of options here - this could even be that we could get our money direct from the Treasury in London and look after our own future.\n\n\"We have been held down and we all know most of what I could say today in terms of discrimination against this community from governments. We all know how much less we get compared to other island groups.\"\n\nCouncil leader James Stockan says Orkney does not get fair funding within the UK\n\nOrkney Islands Council previously voted in 2017 to look at whether the islands could have greater autonomy.\n\nWhile councillors wanted to have a \"stronger voice\", they did not back full independence for Orkney.\n\nCurrently, most of the island's 21 councillors sit as independents - two are Greens.\n\nMr Stockan has said an ageing ferry fleet is among the issues being faced by islanders.\n\nHe previously told the BBC the situation was \"critical\" because the ferries, which are older than the Western Isles fleet, were beginning to fail.\n\nHis concerns were widely shared by other councillors, however some raised issues with self-governance, such as the cost of carrying out such investigations.\n\nCllr Steven Heddle also mentioned disadvantages including having to buy back the sea bed, and tuition fees for students wishing to study in Scotland.\n\nHe called Mr Stockan's efforts \"politics of grievance\" and said that every council felt hard done by, citing roads in Edinburgh that were \"worse\" than Orkney's despite the council having far more funding.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak's official spokesperson said: \"First and foremost there is no mechanism for the conferral of Crown Dependency or Overseas Territory status on any part of the UK.\n\n\"We have no plans to change the devolution settlement we are supporting Orkney with \u00a350m to grow the economic prosperity of the Scottish islands, through the islands deal.\n\n\"But the government's position is that the UK is stronger united.\"\n\nOrkney was previously held under Norwegian and Danish control until it became part of Scotland in 1472.\n\nThe islands were used as security for the wedding dowry of Margaret of Denmark, the future wife of King James III of Scotland.\n\nThe Scottish government said in 2023-24 Orkney Islands Council would receive \u00a389.7m to fund services, with an extra \u00a34.6m from an increase in council tax by 10%.\n\nA spokesperson added it was \"committed to supporting island communities\".\n\nThe Norwegian government declined to comment on the proposals.\n\nToday's vote was never about Orkney becoming part of Norway, or any of the other headlines we've seen over recent days.\n\nRather it was a chance for councillors to express their extreme frustration with what they see as the unfair deal they get from the Scottish and UK governments, with council leader James Stockan saying the islands had been failed by both of them.\n\nThe successful passing of the motion is the first of many hurdles in Orkney gaining a degree of greater autonomy.\n\nCouncil officials will now be tasked with investigating options. Mr Stockan said that \"nothing was off the table\" - including of course the much-publicised return to Norway or Denmark.\n\nReaction to the vote on the streets of Kirkwall has been fairly mixed.\n\nSome don't want to see any tax-payer money devoted to what one councillor described as \"frankly bizarre fantasies\".\n\nOthers feel that the council does get a raw deal from both Holyrood and Westminster, and that anything that gets the two governments to sit up and pay attention is worth looking at.\n\nThe eyes of the global media have been on Orkney for the past few days.\n\nIt's now up to the islands council to capitalise on that attention.", "The Strangford Lough Ferry service will be suspended for seven days due to the strike\n\nHundreds of schoolchildren who use the Strangford Ferry in County Down face disruption over the next seven days due to strike action by ferry workers.\n\nThe service will not be operational for a week, meaning commuters will have to find an alternative means of transport.\n\nOne principal said four of his pupils will be left without any way of getting to school.\n\nThe trade union Unite said members voted to strike after rejecting a pay offer of \u00a3552 extra per year.\n\nIts general secretary, Sharon Graham, said the offer was a \"slap in the face\" for those responsible for the maintenance of vital public services and infrastructure.\n\nThe strike action began at 00:01 BST on Thursday and will continue until 00:00 on Wednesday 26 April.\n\nUnite and GMB union members within the roads service and forestry service have also begun industrial action.\n\nWith a journey time of 10 minutes, the ferry crossing can save a 50-mile drive around Strangford Lough from Portaferry to Strangford.\n\nAmong those on strike is skipper Jonathon Brownlee who said any disruption was \"regrettable\" but staff has come \"to the end of the road.\"\n\n\"After 15 years of austerity, our pay has now fallen about 15% behind where prices have pushed inflation,\" he told BBC News NI.\n\n\"In addition to that we know for a fact that we aren't being paid the market value for the job we do and we are being taken for granted.\"\n\nStrangford Ferry skipper Jonathan Brownlee said he believed workers were \"being taken advantage of\" by their employers\n\nAlan Perry of the GMB union said that the strike would have a huge impact which was \"entirely avoidable\".\n\n\"Workers are demanding a fair pay increase to protect themselves and their families from surging prices,\" he added.\n\nOne of the affected pupils, Owen, travels on the ferry to St Patrick's Grammar School in Downpatrick.\n\nHe told BBC News NI on Thursday that he may be more tired than usual but added at least it is only for a week.\n\n\"I found out on Tuesday; some people found out quicker than me, today it was just awkward getting up that bit earlier and not knowing what is going to happen,\" he said.\n\nSt Patrick's Grammar School pupil Owen admits he may be more tired than usual this week\n\nThe Department for Infrastructure said it would not be able to provide the minimum number of crew needed to safely operate the ferry service and it had no option but to suspend services during the strike period.\n\nSpeaking about the wider industrial action, the department added: \"While contingency arrangements are in place, to limit potential impacts as much as possible, this strike action will affect many of our routine and emergency response functions.\"\n\nIt said this will affect the repair of serious infrastructure defects such as manhole collapse or potholes, reduce its capacity to respond to flood emergencies and will also affect the response to incidents on the road such as oil spills.\n\nThe principal of St Patrick's Grammar said as many as 90 pupils could be affected by the suspension of the ferry service.\n\nHowever, he said the Education Authority and Translink coordinated with the school to make alternative arrangements.\n\nMr McCann said the suspension of the ferry would add an extra 30 minutes each way to their normal journey time.\n\n\"We are delighted that our students can still get to school whilst still being respectful of the rights of Unite workers,\" he continued.\n\nThe Education Authority told BBC News NI that it had established contingency arrangements for 20, 21 and 24 April, which , while it was looking at plans for 25 and 26 April.\n\nIt added that those plans \"may be impacted further by other industrial action taking place during this time\".\n\nJames Hay, principal of St Columba's College in Portaferry, said seven of his pupils take the Strangford Ferry to school.\n\nThree of them live in Strangford, the other lives in the countryside but none of them qualify for free transport.\n\n\"Now because those children don't have a bus pass or provision they are likely to not to have any way of getting into school,\" he said.\n\nMr Hay heard about the strike happening on Monday evening and said he was taken aback by the short notice.\n\nThe GMB union says the pay offer equates to an increase of around 28p per hour\n\nRoad service workers in Northern Ireland are among those striking over pay across Northern Ireland.\n\nAaron McGrotty, of the GMB union, was on the picket line at the Roads Service depot in Londonderry.\n\nHe said members want to work but have been left with no option but to strike following a \"paltry pay offer\" aimed at settling the dispute.\n\n\"It works out to around 28 pence per hour, that is absolutely disgusting for the amount of work a lot of employees do,\" he told BBC Radio Foyle.\n\n\"They have been underpaid for a long, long time. Enough is enough.\"", "Labour would give people greater choice over where they receive hospital treatment, the shadow health secretary has pledged.\n\nWes Streeting said organising waiting lists by region would give patients more freedom and help tackle backlogs.\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer is expected to commit to delivering the idea across England during a speech on Monday.\n\nThe address is also expected to include new pledges on NHS targets.\n\nIt will be the third in a series of speeches he is making on Labour's five \"missions\" for government if it wins power. These missions are likely to form the backbone of the party's manifesto at the next general election, expected in 2024.\n\nSpeaking on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Mr Streeting said organising waiting lists on a regional basis would give patients \"real choice\" over where they are seen.\n\nThe party says this would allow patients to get treatment more quickly if queues are shorter at nearby hospitals.\n\nUnder Labour's plan, it is understood that waiting lists would be shared across integrated care systems - coalitions of several neighbouring NHS trusts that usually cover populations of between 500,000 and 3 million people.\n\nPatients already have some rights to choose where they receive non-urgent care under NHS England's constitution, but the party sees this option as under-used.\n\nIn his BBC interview, Mr Streeting said many patients were unaware about their rights to choice over treatment, or don't \"feel the freedom to exercise that choice\".\n\nHe said that a trial in West Yorkshire, where NHS trusts are sharing waiting lists for conditions affecting blood vessels, showed the approach worked.\n\nThe change would also \"build more capacity in the system\", he added, to help tackle waiting lists that have ballooned since the pandemic.\n\nElsewhere, Mr Streeting said Labour also wanted to see a greater share of NHS spending outside of hospitals to tackle health problems earlier.\n\nHe said that the proportions of spending were \"very different\" in other developed economies that have \"much better outcomes than we have here in the UK\".\n\n\"We under invest in primary care, community services, mental health, diagnostics, and capital, and we've got to shift that focus,\" he added.\n\n\"Lots of hospital trust leaders are already doing this. They recognise that the pressure we see in hospitals is in part driven by the clogged front door to the NHS in primary care and community services as well as delayed discharges in social care.\"\n\nSpeaking on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, former Tory chairman Sir Jake Berry rubbished Labour's approach, saying the party was aiming to \"do more of what the Conservative government is already doing\".\n\nThe government says it wants to boost community NHS services. It recently announced plans to let high street pharmacies prescribe a greater range of common prescription drugs, including antibiotics, to ease the pressure on GPs.\n\nAnd as part of efforts to cut waiting lists, ministers say new community \"diagnostic centres\" opening this year will allow people to access checks and scans for conditions such as cancer, heart disease or lung disease without travelling to a hospital.\n\nLabour does not want to make multiple expensive promises. But it might be tricky to translate its ambitions into concrete plans that the public believe will make an immediate difference - and getting voters excited about structural changes to the NHS might be a tall order.\n\nMr Streeting also confirmed that a review of social care policy carried out for the party will be published next month.\n\nThe report, by a Labour-affiliated think tank, is expected to inform the party's position on social care ahead of the next election.\n\nHe did not offer details of what will be in the blueprint, but said Labour has previously stressed the need to improve pay in the sector, as well supporting people more in their own homes.", "The Walt Disney Company has scrapped a plan to invest nearly $1bn (\u00a3806m) to build a new corporate campus in Florida, it announced.\n\nThe reversal comes amid an escalating feud between the entertainment giant and the state's Republican-led government headed by Ron DeSantis.\n\nThe plan would have seen about 2,000 employees relocate to a Disney-owned complex at Lake Nona, near Orlando.\n\nThe cancellation was announced in an internal email to employees on Thursday.\n\nThe email, seen by BBC News, said the company's decision was the result of \"considerable changes\" that have taken place since it was first announced.\n\nIn the email, Josh D'Amaro, the head of Disney's theme park division, also referred to \"changing business conditions\".\n\nWhile the email does not mention politics or Mr DeSantis, it has been interpreted as alluding to mounting tensions between Disney and Florida lawmakers.\n\n\"Disney announced the possibility of a Lake Nona campus nearly two years ago. Nothing ever came of the project, and the state was unsure whether it would come to fruition,\" Mr DeSantis' office said in a statement.\n\n\"Given the company's financial straits, falling market cap and declining stock price, it is unsurprising that they would restructure their business operations and cancel unsuccessful ventures.\"\n\nThe internal Disney email noted that the decision to scrap the project comes after \"new leadership\" at the company, referring to the sudden departure in November of ex-CEO Bob Chapek.\n\nThe Lake Nona campus, which had not been built, would have been a new home for employees at the firm's secretive theme park research and development arm, known as Imagineers, who were asked to move from California to Florida.\n\nMr D'Amaro's email said relocation would no longer be required and it would discuss next steps with those he said had already done so.\n\nMany of the jobs that were supposed to relocate to Florida were higher paid, white collar and tech-focused positions.\n\nThe Orlando Business Journal reported the project was valued at about $867m and that the average annual wage for the positions was $120,000.\n\nBob Iger, the former chief executive who made a stunning return to replace his successor, Mr Chapek, has announced sweeping changes to boost the firm's business, which has come under pressure as the traditional movie and television industries decline.\n\nDisney launched a streaming offering, Disney+, in 2019, but it remains loss making.\n\nUnlike other media companies, Disney has been shielded by the popularity of its theme parks, which have kept the firm profitable.\n\nBut the value of its share price has halved since peaking in March 2021, as investors predict a tough road ahead.\n\nEarlier this year, Mr Iger announced a plan to save $5.5bn, involving a sweeping reorganisation of the company's operations and roughly 7,000 job losses.\n\nAmong the cuts, announced separately on Thursday, was the closure of a 100-room Star Wars-themed immersive hotel experience at one of its Florida theme parks.\n\nThe relationship between Disney and Florida - where it employs more than 70,000 staff - began deteriorating last year after Mr DeSantis condemned the company for opposing a state law banning discussion of sexual orientation or gender identity in public schools.\n\nIn April, Florida also moved to take control of the Reedy Creek Improvement District - covering the 25,000-acre area known as Walt Disney World - a self-governing zone, with utilities and a fire department.\n\nState lawmakers voted to give Mr DeSantis the power to appoint members to the district's governing board, removing that authority from landowners, of which Disney was by far the biggest.\n\nThe move prompted a lawsuit from Disney, accusing state officials of conducting \"a relentless campaign to weaponise government power against Disney in retaliation for expressing a political viewpoint unpopular with certain state officials\".\n\nDisney's parks in Florida have long been one of its most-popular attractions, bringing in about 50 million visitors each year.\n\nIn a call with investors a week ago, Mr Iger questioned Florida's interest in having Disney grow in the state.\n\n\"Does the state want us to invest more, employ more people and pay more taxes, or not?\" Mr Iger asked.\n\nAubrey Jewett, a politics professor at the University of Central Florida, said he believed Mr DeSantis and his allies \"did not think about the longer-term ramifications of their actions\" when they moved to \"punish Disney for speaking out\".\n\n\"They weren't going to move the Disney World complex someplace else. But as Disney has just shown, that's not the only investment and jobs they were talking about creating in Florida.\"\n\nErin Huntley, the chair of the Republican Party in Orange County, where Disney World is located, said \"it's a different ballgame\" now compared to when Walt Disney first realised the area's potential in the 1960s.\n\n\"People are still wanting to come here, no matter what battles are going on,\" she told the BBC. \"Central Florida is more than just Disney.\"\n\nMr DeSantis is expected to announce a 2024 presidential bid next week. His likely rival, Donald Trump, said in a statement that Mr DeSantis was being \"absolutely destroyed by Disney\" and that his \"political stunt\" of battling them was \"all so unnecessary\".\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nAdditional reporting by Natalie Sherman in New York.\n\nCORRECTION: The headline in the initial versions of this story misstated the value of Disney's investment in billions rather than millions.", "Last updated on .From the section Motorsport\n\nDutch racing driver Dilano van 't Hoff has died after a crash at a race in the Formula Regional European Championship.\n\nThe 18-year-old MP Motorsport driver was competing in the second race at the Spa-Francorchamps circuit in Belgium, organisers announced.\n\nFrench driver Anthoine Hubert lost his life at the same circuit during a Formula 2 race in 2019.\n\nThe race organisers said: \"We want to express our sincere condolences to the family, team and friends.\"\n\nThey added: \"Royal Automobile Club of Belgium, the Circuit of Spa-Francorchamps and SRO Motorsports Group join Alpine and ACI in expressing their sincerest condolences to the driver's family, team and friends.\"\n\nOrganisers of the headline GT race, the 24 Hours of Spa, said on social media: \"All start line entertainments for the 24 Hours of Spa have been cancelled and there will be a minute's silence before the start of the race to honour the memory of Dilano.\"\n\nThe Formula Regional European Championship by Alpine is a European Formula Three racing series intended to be a stepping stone to the FIA Formula Three Championship.\n\nFormula 1 boss Stefano Domenicali said on Twitter: \"We are so sad to learn of the passing of Dilano van 't Hoff today at Spa-Francorchamps.\n\n\"Dilano died in pursuit of his dream to reach the pinnacle of motorsport.

Our lambing percentages dropped 30% from one year to the next.\n\n\"There's no other reason that it would happen - I've seen enough bad weather and any other problems you can have.\n\n\"But they are the biggest problem we could have.\n\n\"It shows what happens every year: If they're not rearing chicks, they're not killing as many lambs.\n\n\"But if they are rearing chicks, then you're finding lambs with a hole in the ribcage and the soft tissue taken away.\n\n\"The heart, lungs and liver are taken away to feed the chicks.\"\n\nHe added: \"I don't know what the solution is, but something's got to be done.\"\n\nMr Ames hopes that if the project is successful, it could secure funding to help other farmers.\n\nA NatureScot spokesperson said: \"The Sea Eagle Management Scheme provides a range of support to holdings affected by sea eagle predation of livestock.\n\n\"This includes support for new ideas proposed by farmers and crofters participating in the scheme, in our collaborative work to mitigate sea eagle predation.\n\n\"The use of guardian dogs to mitigate sea eagle predation in Scotland is a new approach and if there is interest from farmers and crofters in exploring this approach this is something we would consider as we have with other ideas.\"", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. The island has slowly been reclaimed by nature\n\nJust off the Pembrokeshire coast lies a long-deserted island fort that has slowly been reclaimed by nature.\n\nFor decades Stack Rock Fort off Milford Haven has been disturbed only by gulls and creeping weeds, but its new owner invited photographer Steve Liddiard to take a look inside the 19th Century time capsule.\n\n\"When you first walk through it takes your breath away,\" said Steve.\n\n\"It's like a huge cathedral, an oval shape, completely overgrown with these sea birds circling it.\n\nPhotographer Steve Liddiard was invited to take a tour of the fort\n\n\"It doesn't seem real... it looks like a film set, something from Jumanji or something like that.\"\n\nSteve, who works in the IT department at Swansea's Morriston Hospital, started taking photos as a hobby five or six years ago.\n\nThis island fort was built between 1850 and 1852 to protect against an invasion by sea\n\nHe spotted the long-abandoned fort on the Milford Haven Waterway, took some photos and shared them on social media.\n\nSteve said he then received a message from the owner, who said he loved the photos.\n\nThey began chatting and a few weeks later he and a handful of other photographers were invited to visit the fort by boat and take photos from inside.\n\nThe fort can only be reached by boat\n\n\"When you start walking around it you can see the actual scale of it, it's over three different levels,\" said Steve.\n\n\"It is a complete time capsule with massive cannons inside.\n\n\"There's weeds and ivy growing all over it which sort of adds to it more than anything, I think.\"\n\nThe property has been bought by Anoniiem, a community interest company, which plans to preserve it as a \"living ruin\".\n\n\"We want to preserve it in its current state, not in its formal use, so if it can be stabilised as it is, in this amazing combination of nature and architecture, that's the goal,\" said the company's director Nick.\n\nThe fort is built on a small island in the Milford Haven Waterway\n\nThe project began after Nick and his wife were watching the BBC series Coast and found themselves captivated by this part of the Pembrokeshire coast.\n\nThey began looking into the area, stumbled upon the fort and were blown away by its \"fantasy and magic\".\n\nSteve was able to explore three floors of the structure\n\nThey discovered there was a company looking to turn it into a community space and despite never having taken on a project like this before decided to partner with them.\n\n\"It's definitely a passion project, it's definitely not a money earner, there's no plans for a five-star hotel or any of these kind of things,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a stabilisation accessibility project and preserving it for the future.\"\n\nThe island fort was built between 1850 and 1852 to protect against an invasion by sea.\n\nThe original idea for a fort on Stack Rock goes back to Thomas Cromwell in 1539 but it was not until the mid-1800s that any plan came to fruition.\n\nInside the fort is like a \"time capsule\", photographer Steve said\n\nThe Royal Dockyard at Pembroke Dock was deemed in need of further defences in case of an invasion from France under Napoleon III.\n\nDuring World War I it was manned by just a small number of soldiers and eventually disarmed in 1929.\n\nA team of volunteers will help to preserve the building\n\nTaking on a building with this history and in this location presents a myriad of challenges - it is a scheduled monument, part of the national park and can only be accessed in certain conditions by boat.\n\nThere are also issues around security, which have been referred to the police.\n\n\"People have been lighting bonfires on there. It's not safe for the schedule monument itself but also for the people who are breaking in,\" said Nick.\n\nNick has a team of volunteers working to help secure the structure but admits they are \"a lifetime away\" from being able to open it up to the public.\n\n\"In the meantime, we're looking to allow for some explorers, such as Steve to safely access it in a way that lets it kind of live,\" he said.\n\nNick describes the task of preserving the building as a \"passion project\"\n\nDespite the overwhelming scale of the project he is undeterred.\n\n\"It's a hell of a project,\" he said. \"It's been effectively untouched for 100 years so the preservation is on another level.\n\n\"The fact that that nature is taking over again is part of the appeal of it, it's all aesthetically so incredible.\"", "Warning have been put in place at some north coast beaches\n\nPotentially toxic blue-green algae have been spotted at fresh locations along the north coast, Northern Ireland environmental authorities have warned.\n\nThe bacteria were found at Portstewart and Castlerock beaches earlier this week.\n\nRed flag warnings were extended west to the beach at Downhill on Sunday, the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) said.\n\nThese have also been extended to Benone beach as a precautionary measure.\n\nRed flag warnings were extended west to the beach at Downhill on Sunday\n\nBlue-green algae is not actually an alga but rather a type of bacteria called cyanobacteria.\n\nIt can cause illness in humans but is particularly dangerous for pets and has been implicated in the deaths of several dogs in other locations where it has been detected.\n\nSwimmers and dog walkers have been advised to adhere to any advice about getting into the water.\n\nScientists from the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute are working with DAERA, assisting with modelling to predict how tidal flows will affect the algal blooms.\n\nDownhill Beach is popular with dog walkers but pet owners have been warned of the possibility of potentially toxic algae\n\nA scientist told BBC News NI last Friday that the organism cannot survive in salt water, but it was still being washed from Lough Neagh down the River Bann to the coast.\n\nThe DAERA officials have encouraged people to get involved in citizen science and help monitor the presence of blue-green algae, via an app or by contacting the department directly.", "There have been calls for Orkney to become part of Norway\n\nOrkney councillors have voted to investigate alternative methods of governance amid deep frustrations over funding and opportunities.\n\nCouncil leader James Stockan said the islands had been \"held down\" and accused the Scottish and UK governments of discrimination.\n\nHis motion led to media speculation that Orkney could leave the UK or become a self-governing territory of Norway.\n\nIt was supported by 15 votes to six.\n\nIt means council officers have been asked to publish a report to Orkney's chief executive on options of governance.\n\nThis includes looking at the \"Nordic connections\" of the archipelago and crown dependencies such as Jersey and Guernsey.\n\nA further change which would see the revival of a consultative group on constitutional reform for the islands was accepted without the need for a vote.\n\nOn Monday, the prime minister's spokesperson rejected the suggestion the islands could loosen its ties with the union.\n\nMr Stockan urged councillors to back his idea to find new ways to get greater financial security and economic opportunities for Orcadians.\n\nSpeaking to councillors on Tuesday, he said the motion was \"not about us joining Norway\".\n\nHe added: \"I say it's time for government to take us seriously and I say it's time for us to look at all the options we've got.\n\n\"There is a far bigger suite of options here - this could even be that we could get our money direct from the Treasury in London and look after our own future.\n\n\"We have been held down and we all know most of what I could say today in terms of discrimination against this community from governments. We all know how much less we get compared to other island groups.\"\n\nCouncil leader James Stockan says Orkney does not get fair funding within the UK\n\nOrkney Islands Council previously voted in 2017 to look at whether the islands could have greater autonomy.\n\nWhile councillors wanted to have a \"stronger voice\", they did not back full independence for Orkney.\n\nCurrently, most of the island's 21 councillors sit as independents - two are Greens.\n\nMr Stockan has said an ageing ferry fleet is among the issues being faced by islanders.\n\nHe previously told the BBC the situation was \"critical\" because the ferries, which are older than the Western Isles fleet, were beginning to fail.\n\nHis concerns were widely shared by other councillors, however some raised issues with self-governance, such as the cost of carrying out such investigations.\n\nCllr Steven Heddle also mentioned disadvantages including having to buy back the sea bed, and tuition fees for students wishing to study in Scotland.\n\nHe called Mr Stockan's efforts \"politics of grievance\" and said that every council felt hard done by, citing roads in Edinburgh that were \"worse\" than Orkney's despite the council having far more funding.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak's official spokesperson said: \"First and foremost there is no mechanism for the conferral of Crown Dependency or Overseas Territory status on any part of the UK.\n\n\"We have no plans to change the devolution settlement we are supporting Orkney with \u00a350m to grow the economic prosperity of the Scottish islands, through the islands deal.\n\n\"But the government's position is that the UK is stronger united.\"\n\nOrkney was previously held under Norwegian and Danish control until it became part of Scotland in 1472.\n\nThe islands were used as security for the wedding dowry of Margaret of Denmark, the future wife of King James III of Scotland.\n\nThe Scottish government said in 2023-24 Orkney Islands Council would receive \u00a389.7m to fund services, with an extra \u00a34.6m from an increase in council tax by 10%.\n\nA spokesperson added it was \"committed to supporting island communities\".\n\nThe Norwegian government declined to comment on the proposals.\n\nToday's vote was never about Orkney becoming part of Norway, or any of the other headlines we've seen over recent days.\n\nRather it was a chance for councillors to express their extreme frustration with what they see as the unfair deal they get from the Scottish and UK governments, with council leader James Stockan saying the islands had been failed by both of them.\n\nThe successful passing of the motion is the first of many hurdles in Orkney gaining a degree of greater autonomy.\n\nCouncil officials will now be tasked with investigating options. Mr Stockan said that \"nothing was off the table\" - including of course the much-publicised return to Norway or Denmark.\n\nReaction to the vote on the streets of Kirkwall has been fairly mixed.\n\nSome don't want to see any tax-payer money devoted to what one councillor described as \"frankly bizarre fantasies\".\n\nOthers feel that the council does get a raw deal from both Holyrood and Westminster, and that anything that gets the two governments to sit up and pay attention is worth looking at.\n\nThe eyes of the global media have been on Orkney for the past few days.\n\nIt's now up to the islands council to capitalise on that attention.", "The heat and rubble has hindered the search for survivors\n\nSix bodies have been found after an explosion flattened a four-storey apartment building in the southern French city of Marseille.\n\nOfficials said two others remained unaccounted for and rescue efforts continued in the La Plaine district.\n\nA firefighter told AFP news agency the search for survivors was a \"race against the clock\".\n\nThe cause remains unclear, but investigators are looking into the possibility of a gas leak.\n\nThe blast occurred at 00:49 local time on Sunday (22:49 GMT on Saturday).\n\nHousing Minister Oliver Klein described the discovery of the bodies as \"gruesome, difficult and dramatic\", and told reporters the government would support the families of the victims.\n\nFive people from neighbouring buildings sustained minor injuries in the explosion and around 200 people had to be evacuated from their homes.\n\nTwo nearby blocks partially collapsed a few hours later, but there were no further reports of injuries from this.\n\nThe mayor of Marseille, Benoit Payan, warned there was still a risk that nearby buildings could collapse.\n\nAround 100 firefighters attended the scene to tackle a blaze that burned under the rubble throughout Sunday.\n\nThe fire hampered progress and made it difficult for sniffer dogs to detect survivors or bodies.\n\nThe building is believed to have had one apartment on each storey.\n\nIn a brief statement announcing the discovery of the bodies, the fire department said that \"given the difficulties of intervention, the extraction [of the bodies from the site] will take time\".\n\nA local gymnasium and two schools have been opened to accommodate the people who have had to leave their homes. Psychological support is also being offered.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said on Twitter that he was \"thinking of those affected and their loved ones\" and thanked the emergency workers for their efforts.\n\nMayor of Marseille Beno\u00eet Payan said rescuers remained \"determined\" to find people alive. \"Hope must hold us,\" he said.\n\nOne local told French media that they heard an explosion \"unlike anything I've ever heard\".\n\nSpeaking to AFP, Saveria Mosnier, who lives nearby, said on Sunday: \"I was sleeping and there was this huge blast that really shook the room. I was shocked awake as if I had been dreaming.\"\n\nShe added: \"We very quickly smelled a strong gas odour that hung around. We could still smell it this morning.\"\n\nDeputy Mayor Yannick Ohanessian told reporters at the scene that \"several\" witnesses had described a \"suspicious smell of gas\".\n\nInterior Minister Gerald Darmanin visited the scene on Sunday, followed by Housing Minister Olivier Klein on Monday.\n\nIn 2018, housing standards in Marseille came under scrutiny after two dilapidated buildings in the working class district of Noailles collapsed, killing eight people.\n\nFollowing that incident, charities estimated that 40,000 people in the city were living in poorly-built homes, but on Sunday officials appeared to rule out structural issues as a cause of the latest collapse.\n\nChristophe Mirmand, a local authority leader in the Bouches-du-Rhone region, said there was no danger notice on the building and that it was not in a neighbourhood identified as having substandard housing.

At the wheel of a 'world first' self-driving bus ready to take to the roads in Scotland\n\nThe UK's first full-sized driverless buses have started operating for passengers in Edinburgh.\n\nThe autonomous vehicles, operated by Stagecoach, run across the Forth Road Bridge from Ferrytoll park-and-ride in Fife to Edinburgh Park station.\n\nDespite the \"driverless\" name, the buses operate with two staff on board.\n\nOne will sit in the driver's seat to monitor the technology, and a so-called bus captain will help passengers with boarding and buying tickets.\n\nStagecoach said the five single-decker buses have the capacity for about 10,000 passenger journeys per week.\n\nThe vehicles have sensors enabling them to travel on pre-selected roads on the 14-mile route at up to 50mph.\n\nThe AB1 service is the first registered autonomous bus route in UK.\n\nIt is part of Project CAVForth, run by Stagecoach and funded by the UK government.\n\nStagecoach worked with Fusion Processing Ltd and project partners Transport Scotland, Alexander Dennis, Edinburgh Napier University and Bristol Robotics Laboratory.\n\nThe Alexander Dennis Enviro200AV buses can take on complex traffic manoeuvres such as roundabouts, traffic lights, and weaving between motorway lanes.\n\nThe project has recruited 20 staff from Stagecoach East Scotland's existing driving team.\n\nStagecoach UK managing director Carla Stockton-Jones said: \"We are excited to introduce the UK's first autonomous bus fleet in east Scotland.\n\n\"We are proud to be at the forefront of transport innovation with this project that marks a significant milestone for public transport.\"", "Fraudsters who offer to help people illegally pass their UK driving tests are advertising their services widely across social media, the BBC has found.\n\nMore than 600 pages, groups and accounts exist on Facebook and TikTok promising licences without taking tests - with thousands of followers.\n\nSome suggest lookalikes to take the practical test - others offer theory test help via a Bluetooth earpiece.\n\nMeta and TikTok said such content violates their guidelines.\n\nBBC Verify analysed data from Facebook and TikTok and found as of 16 June there were at least 669 pages, groups and accounts with 138,900 followers which advertised driving licence services without taking a test. Adverts also appear on Instagram.\n\nReports of driving test fraud through impersonations have more than trebled in the past five years - from 654 in 2018 to 2,015 in 2023 - exclusive figures given to the BBC by the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) reveal.\n\nIt says the number of people who are being caught - and having their licences revoked - is increasing, although it remains a largely hidden problem.\n\nBetween April 2021 to March 2022, more than four million theory and practical car tests were taken in the UK, with a pass rate of about half.\n\nStill from a TikTok story advertising a full UK driving licence without taking a test\n\nOur investigation found social media platforms littered with posts in different languages. Many use genuine pictures of pass certificates and driving licences which have been taken from promotional images posted on real driving school social media accounts.\n\nThe posts provide limited information about how these licences are provided without taking a test, most posts just provide a mobile number or ask people to contact them for more information via a direct message.\n\nThe BBC contacted several people advertising these services on social media, posing as someone without any driving experience who was looking for a licence.\n\nOne man advertising on Facebook claimed he could provide a UK driving licence for \u00a3720, with the pass certificate delivered to the reporter's home in five days - without anyone actually sitting a test.\n\nA theory test costs \u00a323 and the practical test \u00a362, but the RAC estimates the total cost of learning to drive is \u00a31,551 including tests and lessons - assuming the person passes first time. In Northern Ireland the tests cost \u00a323 for the theory and \u00a345.50 for the practical test.\n\nOne woman who advertised on Facebook in Vietnamese told our reporter she charged \u00a31,600 for help with cheating the theory test and \u00a32,600 for the practical driving test - a total of \u00a34,200.\n\nShe said first she needed to see what the reporter looked like to ensure she had a suitable lookalike to take the tests.\n\nThe BBC also tracked down a woman who paid for a fraudulent service. She had found someone via a Facebook post to take the practical test for her son who had been struggling to pass.\n\nThe mother paid the fraudster about \u00a31,000 after he had passed the test on her son's behalf.\n\nIf the woman's son is ever caught he would have his licence revoked and face prosecution for fraud, potentially resulting in a prison sentence and/or a fine.\n\nTikTok and Meta, the company that owns Facebook and Instagram, told the BBC that the solicitation of driving licence fraud is not allowed on their platforms and any content found that violates their guidelines will be removed.\n\nTikTok also says it has taken action against a number of accounts following the BBC Investigation.\n\nDriving instructors have told the BBC that the rise in practical test fraud could be due to the length of time it is taking to get a practical test slot.\n\nIn some parts of the UK there are waiting times of up to six months due to a backlog following the Covid pandemic. Some of the fraudsters the BBC spoke to were willing to travel to parts of the UK where waiting times are shorter to take the test for others.\n\nCarly Brookfield, chief executive of the Driving Instructors Association, said the backlog was causing \"a desperation for test slots\".\n\n\"If you're facing the fact that if you don't pass the test you have to wait for up to six months [to try again], then you're going to think about cheating the system,\" she said.\n\nShe added that some of the instructors in her association had been approached by people running criminal services, asking them to refer pupils struggling to pass their test.\n\nThe high demand for tests has led to operators bulk-buying slots using automated software and reselling them at an inflated price.\n\nThe DVSA says it is actively removing accounts which do this as it breaks the terms and conditions of the booking platform.\n\nThe man, who called himself Erdal, told the reporter he could feed them the answers to the theory test via a Bluetooth earpiece\n\nDuring the investigation, the BBC found a flyer in a London cafe written in Turkish offering a \"100% guarantee\" method to pass the theory test.\n\nOur undercover reporter, posing as someone with little experience of driving, met the man behind the advert, who called himself Erdal.\n\nHe told the reporter he could help them cheat by feeding them the answers to the test's multiple choice questions using a \"microscopic\" Bluetooth earpiece, connected to a mobile phone.\n\nHe told them by clicking on the questions they would be \"read out loud\" by the computer which would allow him to whisper the correct answers.\n\nHe said: \"It's \u00a31,500 and you will pay me right after taking the test. You will be wearing a device in your ear. The test administrators will not look in your ear.\n\n\"We have done this for a long time. We do this for a minimum of two people every day.\"\n\nAfter the meeting, the BBC called the number we had for the man to confront him about the scam. The person that answered had the same name but denied knowing anything about test fraud.\n\nThese scam online adverts can also cause identity fraud problems for the people who have photos of their test pass certificates or driving licence lifted from legitimate sites.\n\nWe spoke to Ian Jones, who had a photo of his driving licence stolen from a logistics company he was registered with. He later discovered it was being used on Instagram by someone advertising a service for \"theory/practical certificate without exams\".\n\nMr Jones says in the past year he has had to dispute hundreds of French speeding and parking tickets he has received because his licence details are being used fraudulently abroad.\n\nHe said: \"It makes you paranoid, it gives you a horrible feeling, it's like being burgled - you feel violated.\"\n\nThe DVSA's head of law enforcement said it had revoked hundreds of illegally-obtained licenses in 2022\n\nThe Driving Standards Agency, (DVSA), which promotes road safety and sets standards for training, warns many online adverts promising full licences quickly are money-making scams which may only provide a fake licence. It adds only the Driving and Vehicle and Licensing Agency (DVLA) can issue a genuine driving licence.\n\nThe number of people being prosecuted for test fraud via impersonations are increasing, the DVSA says. If convicted, they face prison sentences and fines. Last year, a woman was jailed for eight months for taking approximately 150 theory and practical tests for other drivers.\n\nThe DVSA warns if people do not meet the necessary driving standards before taking control of a vehicle, it could cause serious injuries or even fatalities.\n\nIts head of law enforcement, Marian Kitson, said its investigation team was catching more people committing fraud and had revoked hundreds of illegally-obtained licences in 2022.\n\nIn the year from April 2022, it sent 30 cases - involving 497 offences - of fraud by false representation for prosecution and there were 53 arrests.\n\nHowever, Ms Kitson said it was clear from their investigations that there was even more occurring, adding that they did not know the true scale of the problem.\n\n\"The internet is so huge; the social media platforms are vast and these people are very clever, they move the adverts around; they change them frequently,\" she said.\n\n\"So actually, spotting them and taking action quickly is a real challenge.\"\n\nHave you been affected by the issues in this story?

The Labour leader has said his missions would form \"the backbone of the Labour manifesto and the pillars of the next Labour government\".\n\nThe other commitments include securing the \"highest sustained growth\" in the G7 group of nations, by the end of Labour's first term, removing fossil fuels from all of Britain's electricity generation by 2030, improving the NHS and reforming the justice system.\n\nThe National Association of Headteachers (NAHT) union welcomed Labour's proposals but warned they must be matched by \"significant additional investment\", not only in education but in community support and social care.\n\n\"There is no doubt that schools can play a vital role in helping children to thrive no matter what their background, but they need the appropriate resources to do so,\" Paul Whiteman, NAHT general secretary, said.\n\nEducation Secretary Gillian Keegan dismissed Sir Keir's speech as \"a load of old nonsense\".\n\nShe accused Labour of offering \"gimmicks that don't help children or working class children\", saying the government was focused on high quality education and apprenticeships to help social mobility.\n\nShe dismissed Sir Keir's plans on improving speaking skills, insisting that this already happened throughout the curriculum, adding: \"We have revolutionised our education system and skills system.\"\n\nAsked about the Green New Deal Rising protest during the speech, Sir Keir denied backtracking on Labour's \u00a328bn green prosperity plan, saying \"We haven't backed down, we've doubled down.\"\n\nAnd he condemned Just Stop Oil's protests as \"hugely arrogant\", saying: \"When I put what they're doing against what we set out in our mission about clean energy, about net zero, you can see the difference between protest and power.\n\n\"Glueing yourself, interrupting, interfering with other people's lives in this arrogant way, compared with the actual change we can bring about, which is with a Labour government absolutely committed to clean power by 2030.\"", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\n\"Humans are a bit boring - it will be like, goodbye!\" That's the personal prediction - that artificial intelligence (AI) will supplant humans in many roles - from one of the most important people you've probably never heard of.\n\nEmad Mostaque is the British founder of the tech firm, Stability AI. It popularised Stable Diffusion, a tool that uses AI to make images from simple text instructions by analysing images found online.\n\nAI enables a computer to think or act more like a human. It includes what's called machine learning, when computers can learn what to do without being giving exact instructions by a human sitting at a keyboard tapping in commands. Last month, there was a dramatic warning from 1,000 experts to press pause on its development, warning of potential risks, and saying the race to develop AI systems is out of control.\n\nIn an interview we'll show in full on Sunday, tech founder Mostaque questions what will happen \"if we have agents more capable than us that we cannot control, that are going across the internet\u2026 and they achieve a level of automation; what does that mean?\n\n\"The worst case scenario is that it proliferates and basically it controls humanity.\"\n\nThat sounds terrifying, but he is not alone in pointing out the risk, that if we create computers smarter than ourselves we just can't be sure what will happen next.\n\nMostaque believes governments could soon be shocked into taking action by an event that makes the risks suddenly real. He points to the moment Tom Hanks contracted Covid-19 and millions sat up and paid attention.\n\nWhen a moment like that arrives, governments will conclude \"we need policy now\", the 40-year-old says.\n\nThere's been a spike in concern for example after a Republican attack advert on Jo Biden was created using fake computer generated images.\n\nWhen there's a risk to information that voters can trust, that's something governments have to respond to, says Mostaque.\n\nDespite his concerns, Mostaque says that the potential benefits of AI for almost every part of our lives could be huge. Yet he concedes that the effect on jobs could be painful, at least at the start.\n\nMostaque says he believes AI \"will be a bigger economic impact than the pandemic\", adding that \"it's up to us to decide which direction\" this all goes in.\n\nAI could lead to 300m job losses according to one prediction.\n\nSome jobs will undoubtedly disappear, the bank Goldman Sachs suggested an almost incomprehensible 300m roles could be lost or diminished by the advancing technology.\n\nWhile no one wants to be replaced by a robot, Mostaque's hope is that better jobs could be created because \"productivity increases will balance out\" and humans can concentrate on the things that make us human, and let machines do more of the rest. He agrees with the UK's former chief scientific advisor, Sir Patrick Vallance, that the advance of AI and its impacts could prove even bigger than the industrial revolution.\n\nMostaque is an unassuming mathematician, the founder of a company he only started in 2020 that has already been valued at $1bn, and with more cash flooding in, including from Hollywood star Ashton Kutcher, is likely to be soon worth very much more. Some speculation has put the value as high $4bn.\n\nUnlike some of his competitors he is determined his technology will remain open source - in other words anyone can look at the code, share it, and use it. In his view, that's what should give the public a level of confidence in what's going on.\n\n\"I think there shouldn't have to be a need for trust,\" he says.\n\n\"If you build open models and you do it in the open, you should be criticised if you do things wrong and hopefully lauded if you do some things right.\"\n\nBut his business also raises profound questions about ownership, and what's real. There's legal action underway against them by the photo agency Getty Images which claims the rights to the images it sells have been infringed.\n\nIn response, Mostaque says: \"What if you have a robot that's walking around and looking at things, do you have to close its eyes if it sees anything?\"\n\nThat's hardly likely to be the end of that conversation.\n\nThe entrepreneur is convinced that the scale of what's coming is enormous. He reckons that in 10 years time, his company and fellow AI leaders, ChatGPT and DeepMind, will even be bigger than Google and Facebook. Predictions about technology are as tricky as predictions about politics - educated guesses that could turn out to be totally wrong. But what is clear is that a public conversation about the risks and realities of AI is now underway.

A BBC documentary in March detailed allegations from several victims.\n\nMr Okamoto said he had been compelled to speak out after the BBC released Predator: The Secret Scandal of J-Pop documentary.\n\nMultiple accusers told the BBC they feared their careers would be harmed if they refused Kitagawa.\n\nIn Japan, he was viewed as one of the music industry's most powerful figures. When he died in 2019 at age 87, his legacy as the architect of J-pop idol culture was widely celebrated in the country.\n\nHowever allegations of his sexual exploitation were ignored for decades.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr Okamoto said the abuse he experienced occurred about 15 to 20 times at Kitagawa's penthouse in Tokyo.\n\nThe 26-year-old Japanese-Brazilian singer and songwriter said that Kitagawa would come to his bed at night and remove his clothes before performing oral sex on him.

That's what we were wondering most of Monday - two days after a dramatic insurrection by the Wagner Group that saw a convoy of mercenary fighters headed to Moscow.\n\nA spokesman for Mr Putin announced a deal to end the Wagner mutiny late on Saturday. But when would the president himself comment on the controversial agreement?\n\nIt was controversial because the Wagner mercenaries had rebelled, seized military sites (with apparent ease) and then marched on Moscow; Russian air force pilots had been killed in the mutiny. Yet the Kremlin had agreed not to prosecute Wagner fighters or their leader Yevgeny Prigozhin in return for calling off the uprising.\n\nOver the last week, President Putin has made a series of unusual public appearances - all televised - in an apparent attempt to steady the ship.\n\nOn Monday we hear from Mr Prigozhin: an audio message posted online presenting his side of the story. He says his men headed to Moscow to \"hold to account\" those leaders he blamed for \"mistakes\" in the Ukraine war.\n\nThen late into the evening, an announcement is made. \"Standby: President Putin will address the nation.\" Now it feels like the Kremlin leader is playing catch-up.\n\nPutin appears on TV screens after 10pm. A late-night address from him is very unusual. Social media buzzes with rumours that this will be a speech that will \"decide the fate of Russia\". With trepidation we switch on Russian TV to hear the president speak.\n\nIt quickly becomes clear this address will not decide the country's fate. There are no major announcements. But the five-minute speech does provide clues to how the Kremlin is going to spin the dramatic events of the weekend to its benefit.\n\nPutin paints a picture of a Russia that has united to defeat the treachery of Wagner's leaders.\n\nHe tries to bring everyone on side: he thanks the Russian public, Russian officials, religious leaders, the Russian armed forces and his security services. He distinguishes between the leaders of the mutiny and regular Wagner fighters and commanders, whom he praises as patriots. Crucially, he presents himself as the man who averted major bloodshed.\n\n\"As soon as these events began to unfold,\" he says, \"in keeping with my direct instructions, steps were taken to avoid spilling blood\".\n\nRemember that controversy I was talking about? He doesn't address that. But, hey, Russia has stepped back from the brink. That's the main thing.\n\nOn Monday he was playing catch-up. By Tuesday morning it's full steam ahead to try to restore his authority.\n\nAt a hastily arranged event the Russian authorities are going heavy - very heavy - on the pomp and ceremony. Some 2,500 soldiers, Russian Guard and security officials are lined up on the Kremlin's Cathedral Square. This is the site of coronation (and funeral) processions of Russian tsars.\n\nCue Putin: To the presidential fanfare he descends the many steps of the Kremlin down onto the square (red carpet all the way, of course) and with a backdrop of the onion domes of Kremlin cathedrals the president - and commander-in-chief - delivers a speech to his troops.\n\nBut even before he starts to speak, the imagery says it all. It's all here in one place: the Orthodox Church, the Kremlin, the president and the army. It reminds me of the old Imperial Russian slogan: \"For faith, for the Tsar and the Fatherland.\"\n\nIn other words, the visual messaging here is all about presenting Russia as a country uniting behind Vladimir Putin. It's almost as if they want Russians to think that the Church, the military, and the president are interlinked, even part of one whole.\n\nIn his brief address, President Putin again claims that Russian society has come together after the Wagner mutiny. But most of what he says is praise for his military for \"stopping a civil war\".\n\nThere's a minute's silence for the air force pilots who were killed. The president is paying his respects, but still not addressing the question of why Wagner fighters are not being prosecuted over their deaths.\n\nSpeech over. Cue the national anthem and a gun salute.\n\nOverall message: the president's not only in charge. With the help of the Russian army and the Russian people, he's just scored a great victory.\n\nThis is probably the most surprising Putin video of the week - perhaps of the year. That's because it's a very un-Putin-like Putin we see, in terms of getting up close and personal with the crowds.\n\nThe official reason President Putin is visiting Dagestan is to chair a meeting on domestic tourism.\n\nBut it's not the meeting that dominates news bulletins later on Russian TV. It's the crazy scenes that follow.\n\nThe Kremlin leader is shown being mobbed by an adoring crowd in the city of Derbent.\n\nWe've grown used to seeing Vladimir Putin keeping his distance from those he comes into contact with. Remember those long Kremlin tables with Putin seated safely at one end and his guests at the other?\n\nNot here. In Dagestan he's kissing children, hugging women, shaking hands and posing for photos.\n\n\"Screaming, squealing, applause,\" exclaims the presenter of a popular talk show on the Russia-1 channel. \"Even rock stars don't get this kind of welcome. The West is scoffing that after Prigozhin's mutiny the president has been weakened. This proves the opposite is the case.\"\n\nPutin's behaviour seems so out of character. On the other hand, nothing feels particularly normal any more in Russia.\n\nThe Russian president had just survived an armed mutiny. Perhaps he feels the need to demonstrate - to the country, to the political elite, and to himself - that he still has supporters out there. A \"spontaneous\" expression of public adoration would fit the bill.\n\nAs I view these images, I suddenly remember what happened last weekend, after the deal was done to end the mutiny. As Wagner fighters led by Mr Prigozhin had left Rostov on Saturday night, they were cheered on the streets.\n\nHas Vladimir Putin seen those images? Does he feel the need for his own \"hero\" moment?\n\nWe'll probably never know.\n\nPresident Putin's attending a business conference on Russian brands in Moscow. It doesn't exactly make for another rock-star moment.\n\nStill, any opportunity to try to show (a) he's in charge (b) he's active (c) he has the support of the people.\n\nThe Russian president is applauded as he enters the hall. He sits down and listens to one of the organisers deliver opening remarks.\n\n\"Vladimir Vladimirovich, along with you and the whole country we, too, lived through the events of 24 June [the mutiny] with anxiety,\" she says addressing Putin. \"We are all with you and we all support you.\"\n\nAs if to prove it, the delegates give Vladimir Putin a standing ovation.\n\nFrom the same event, we see another slightly more bizarre video. President Putin is doodling on an interactive whiteboard.\n\nThe result is a cartoon-like red face with three strands of hair. A curious picture from a leader who has learnt the art of political survival.\n\nLines of loyal troops, gun salutes, screaming fans and a standing ovation. With these kinds of images, the Kremlin leader is trying to show he's back in control.\n\nHe even has time to doodle. He must be feeling confident.\n\nFollowing the mutiny, we've witnessed a turbo-charged Putin this week. He was here, he was there, he seemed to be everywhere. It was almost as if he'd kicked off his campaign for re-election (his presidential term expires next year).\n\nBut positive pictures do not change the fact that the rebellion had taken the Kremlin by surprise. It was a threat. The Wagner fighters had been well on their way to Moscow when the mutiny was called off. It was an unprecedented challenge to Putin's authority.\n\nAnd the long-term consequences of that are still unclear.", "British Transport Police said the alleged assault happened on a train from Aberdare to Cardiff Central\n\nA man was sexually assaulted on a train after lewd comments were made towards him, police say.\n\nThe incident happened at about 12:50 BST on 1 July, on a train from Aberdare to Cardiff Central.\n\nThe victim walked past a group of people before a man allegedly \"made lewd comments towards him\".\n\nPolice said the man then sexually assaulted the victim before \"making light of the incident\".\n\nA 40-year-old man was later arrested in connection with the assault before being released on bail.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nPausing Ofsted inspections would be the \"empathetic, human, correct thing to do\", says the sister of a head teacher who took her own life after an inspection - as the watchdog announces some changes to how it works.\n\nRuth Perry died while waiting for a report that downgraded her school.\n\nHer sister, Prof Julia Waters, wants a full review to take place.\n\nOfsted is making some changes, such as how it manages complaints - but will keep its one-word grading system.\n\nChief inspector Amanda Spielman said the schools watchdog for England, \"will continue to listen\" to try to make improvements.\n\nOfsted has said its thoughts are with Ms Perry's family, and described her death as a tragedy.\n\nThe family believes the anxiety and stress following the inspection led to Ms Perry's suicide.\n\n\"She was fine beforehand, she was not fine during and after it.

However all visits were put on hold in the pandemic.\n\nOutstanding schools were also exempt for eight years up to 2020, which means some are now now facing inspection for the first time in a decade.\n\nSome academy school leaders have said Ofsted is not fully considering the impact of the pandemic.\n\nEducation Secretary Gillian Keegan said standards on keeping children safe would not be \"watered down\", and she continued to support a \"clear one-word rating\" to inform parents' decisions.\n\nShe told MPs earlier this week she would be willing to meet Ms Perry's family.\n\nOfsted, the Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills, inspects and reports on anywhere that provides education for young people in England - including schools, nurseries and childminders.\n\nSchools or organisations are inspected every four years or 30 months depending on their status, and are then graded accordingly:\n\nMany parents rely on Ofsted ratings to help them choose a school or nursery for their child.\n\nFollowing Ruth Perry's death, some school leaders and teaching unions called for a review of the impact of inspections and the current system of one-word grades.\n\nSpeaking to Radio 4's Today programme, Sir Jon Coles, the Chief Executive of United Learning, which runs 72 state academy schools across England, and a former education civil servant who led the improvement of London's schools, said Ofsted is a positive thing and does contribute to public understanding of schools.\n\nHe said inspectors produce a four-page report at the end of a full inspection: \"The overall single-word grade and then the four single-word judgments are accompanied by quite a lot of detail and explanation.\"\n\nJulie McCulloch, from the Association of School & College Leaders (ASCL), said while some of proposals put forward by Ofsted are helpful, they are concerned that Ofsted \"aren't prepared to look at the single-word judgements\".\n\nShe agrees there is a longer report but \"people tend to concentrate on that grade rather than on the nuances behind it, and when we talk to our members, they say the biggest cause of stress around inspection is that reductive approach that tends to capture most of what a school does in a single word or phrase\".\n\nIn March, the National Education Union (NEU), school leaders' union NAHT, and the ASCL called for inspections to be halted.\n\nThe recruitment process for a new chief inspector of Ofsted is already under way, because Ms Spielman is standing down later this year.\n\nProf Waters says change can't wait until then: \"There is an urgent problem in Ofsted, and it needs to be dealt with urgently.

It has also criticised joint military exercises between the US and South Korea, accusing them of escalating tensions.\n\nThe latest missile launch also comes two days before the birthday of North Korea's founding leader Kim Il Sung - the biggest annual holiday on the country's calendar.\n\nIn October 2022, residents in northern Japan woke up to similar sirens and text alerts to take cover after North Korea fired a ballistic missile over Japan.\n\nThe missile travelled 4,500km (2,800 miles) before falling into the Pacific Ocean far from Japan, and there were no reported injuries.\n\nIn October 2022, residents in northern Japan were alerted to take cover after North Korea fired a ballistic missile", "Pavel Kuzin was killed in Bakhmut amid brutal fighting around the eastern Ukrainian city\n\nStaff sergeant Pavel Kuzin took his position at the machine gun - the only soldier still able to fight. Everyone else in his troop lay dead or injured.\n\nSuffering from shell-shock and with one arm bandaged, the 37-year-old fired at the waves of Russian soldiers trying to storm his position. They didn't even try to take cover, but simply walked towards him across the open field.\n\nIt was clear Pavel wouldn't be able to hold the position for long, but he needed to buy time for a rescue team to arrive. His final action in life was to ensure his wounded comrades got to safety.\n\nThe Ukrainian military says Bakhmut is now the scene of many \"unprecedentedly bloody\" battles like this, where they now have to repel up to 50 attacks on their positions every day. Russia has concentrated massive forces in this area, and their brutal strategy of launching human wave attacks helps them to advance slowly - but at a very high cost.\n\nPavel was in charge of a forward observation group that consisted of six Ukrainian soldiers. On 17 February, shortly after the start of their watch, they came under heavy fire. A tank began hammering their position.\n\nUnlike relentless mortar rounds, the tank's aiming was chillingly accurate. Shells were landing a few metres from their trenches. Two soldiers were wounded and Pavel told them to go into a dugout. A combat medic went down to tend to their injuries and prepare them for an evacuation. Moments later, the wooden shelter was directly hit by a shell.\n\n\"There was a bright flash,\" one of the wounded soldiers with a callsign Tsygan told the BBC. \"I was thrown onto the logs with such force that it nearly crushed me. I couldn't understand whether I was dead or alive. Someone was shouting, it seemed the sound was coming from 100m away.\"\n\nI couldn't understand whether I was dead or alive\n\nIt was Pavel's voice who was checking on them. The other soldier was half-buried under dirt and logs. He was dead.\n\nTsygan could barely move and Pavel had to drag him up over the splintered logs that blocked the way. It was painfully slow to move Tsygan just a few metres away into a nearby trench. When the shelling paused briefly, Pavel went back trying to find others.\n\nTwo minesweepers arrived to clear the logs and find the bodies. But yet another shell hit the dug out, killing one of the men and injuring the other. The tank kept firing.\n\nAt that moment, Russian troops started storming their position. Pavel called for a support group to evacuate the wounded and rushed back to his Browning machine gun to stop the Russian infantry.\n\nThe 206th Battalion in which Pavel served had fought in the southern Kherson and north-eastern Kharkiv regions. But the battles over Bakhmut were very different from what they had seen before.\n\n\"The intensity of fighting to break through our positions was shocking,\" says Mykola Hlabets, platoon commander. \"Sometimes, [Russian soldiers] would get as close as 20 metres from us, crawling and moving under a treeline or across an open field. This is where we had our first gunfights at such proximity.\"\n\n\"They would just stand and walk towards our positions without any cover. We wiped out one group after another, but they kept coming.\"\n\nHlabets described them as a suicide squad. Others call them cannon fodder.\n\nUkrainians are trying to fight off Russia's human wave attacks - similar to tactics used during World War One\n\nA number of videos have been shared on telegram channels recently where newly mobilized Russian soldiers appealed to President Vladimir Putin and the authorities to stop what they called \"illegal orders\" to send them \"to be slaughtered\".\n\nLast month mobilised soldiers from Belgorod posted a video saying that they were sent for an assault mission without proper training. After suffering heavy losses, they said they refused to carry out their orders.\n\nOften these poorly trained soldiers are reportedly forced to keep pushing forward. The assault group Storm of the 5th Brigade of the Russian army said in a video appeal that they couldn't leave their position because of zagryad otryad, or blocking troops - detachments that open fire at their own men who try to retreat.\n\nThese wave attacks are similar to World War One tactics, when troops charged the enemy and engaged in close combat. And despite their lack of training and experience, sending newly recruited soldiers to such assaults are bringing some results for Russia, albeit at a very high cost.\n\nUkrainians expose their positions when they open fire to stop those attacks. That allows Russian artillery to identify the target and destroy it, as happened with Pavel's post.\n\nAlso, soldiers at forward positions run out of ammunition while trying to repel numerous wave attacks. They then become an easy target.\n\nThat was the risk Pavel knew he faced as he rushed to his Browning machine gun. But as long as he kept firing, his wounded brothers-in-arms had a chance to be rescued.\n\nTsygan was bleeding in the trench where Pavel had left him. Shrapnel had smashed his pelvis. Another piece had gone through his thigh, and a third had hit his abdomen, \"turning the internal organs upside down\", he said. He was barely conscious.\n\n\"I didn't see much, it was all white,\" he said. \"I lay on the snowy ground for two hours and I didn't feel cold or anything.\"\n\nNext to him was another wounded soldier. The rescue team on an armoured personnel carrier hastily picked them up as shelling resumed. They didn't even have time to close the hatch, Tsygan says.\n\nBy that time, Pavel's machine gun had fallen silent. He died from a head wound: a piece of shrapnel had pierced his helmet.\n\nCommanders of the 206th battalion decided to send a group to retrieve the bodies of Pavel and the other soldiers.\n\nThe next day in the evening, three groups of two soldiers each set off to bring the bodies back.\n\n\"The plan looked good on paper, but things quickly went wrong,\" junior sergeant Vasyl Palamarchuk, who was in the lead group, remembers. They got lost and nearly ran into Russian positions in the dark. When they got close to the dugout, Russians spotted them and opened fire from a tank.\n\nPavel Kuzin died holding off Russian attackers so his wounded fellow soldiers could be evacuated\n\nRussian tanks and artillery had continuously shelled that post in those days, but the Ukrainian big guns had largely stayed quiet. The reason was a massive shortage of shells.\n\n\"Once we counted that the Russians had fired up to 60 shells a day, whereas we could allow only two,\" Palamarchuk explains. \"They destroyed trees and everything else and you had no place to hide.\"\n\nUkraine is struggling to find ammunition for its Soviet-era artillery. Getting shells for weapons donated by Ukraine's western partners has its own limits. As the secretary general of the Nato military alliance, Jens Stoltenberg, said recently: \"The current rate of Ukraine's ammunition expenditure is many times higher than our current rate of production.\"\n\nPalamarchuk's group eventually picked up Pavel's body just a few hours before Russian troops seized the area. Heavy snow turned into a freezing rain. After numerous breaks on the way back, crawling through craters left by shells, they finally arrived. The whole operation over just a kilometre's distance lasted for six hours.\n\nIt was past midnight but the entire battalion gathered at the evacuation point to pay their respects to Pavel, who is survived by his daughter and wife.\n\n\"It was a huge loss for our unit,\" Palamarchuk says. \"He saved two people but died himself.\"", "When the BBC's director general, Tim Davie, took over in 2020, he declared his founding principle to be \"impartiality\".\n\nThree years later, a row over that principle and how it applies across the corporation has created a crisis that has quite clearly caught managers by surprise.\n\nFamiliar, fixed points in the weekly TV schedule unexpectedly falling off air in quick succession is proof of a crisis that has become something much bigger than a row about some tweets.\n\nThe Gary Lineker issue is more than an argument about the opinions of a highly paid sports presenter - it is a test of the BBC's fundamental values and the current director general's core mission.\n\nThe passions provoked by Lineker's political tweets and the decision to keep him off air until he and the BBC resolve this issue has poured petrol on a fire that was already well alight - the debate about the BBC's role in British politics and perceptions of bias both to the left and the right.\n\nBut first, let's look at the immediate issue.\n\nIt's worth noting that complaints about Lineker's politically charged tweets are not new.\n\nIn 2016 and 2018 the BBC defended comments made by the Match of the Day presenter about child migrants and Brexit by saying he was a freelance presenter, it was a private Twitter account and the stringent rules for journalists did not apply equally to sports presenters.\n\nThe guidelines at the time said the risk to compromising the BBC's impartiality \"is lower where an individual is expressing views publicly on an unrelated area, for example, a sports or science presenter expressing views on politics or the arts\".\n\nSince then rules have been tightened. New guidelines on social media demanded an \"extra responsibility\" for presenters with a \"high profile\". Some described the new rule as the \"Lineker clause\".\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: BBC boss Tim Davie asked if he bowed to government pressure\n\nThe question is whether that rule is being fairly applied. Twitter is awash with examples of what some people think are presenters who have gone too far over recent years. Names frequently raised include Alan Sugar, Chris Packham and Andrew Neil.\n\nIn response, Mr Davie said on Saturday evening that he was in \"listening mode\" and suggested there might be an escape route by re-examining those guidelines.\n\nThere is good reason for him to want to bring this to a conclusion. Impartiality is hugely important but so too is providing a service that people pay for through their licence fee.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. WATCH: How the Match of the Day row played out on Saturday... in 60 seconds\n\nMatch of the Day went ahead on BBC One on Saturday night - but was reduced to a 20-minute edition that did not have a presenter, pundits or any commentary - while other football coverage was dropped.\n\nEvery cancelled programme is a source of further complaint from licence payers who may not care what Lineker says on Twitter but care deeply about their favourite programmes staying on air on a Saturday night.\n\nThere is also the wider context of a government that has in recent years been critical of the BBC and its perceived liberal bias.\n\nGreg Dyke, a former director general, who left the BBC over a clash with the Labour Government in 2004, says the decision to pull Gary Lineker from Match of the Day looks like a corporation bowing to political pressure from a Tory government.\n\nAll of which leads to another issue that asks questions of the BBC's impartiality, the BBC's chairman, Richard Sharp, a former donor to the Conservative party who is the subject of an ongoing inquiry looking in to his appointment and what he did or did not disclose about his part in the arrangement of an \u00a3800,000 loan guarantee to the former prime minister, Boris Johnson. He has denied any involvement in arranging the loan.\n\nLineker has become a lightning rod for a much bigger debate and the BBC would like to resolve the issue as quickly as possible to stop a very public row turning into a monumental crisis. However, with the corporation saying it wants Lineker, with his 8.7 million Twitter followers, to stop the political tweets while he shows no sign of agreeing to be silenced, it's hard to see quite how this will resolve itself.\n\nFor the BBC this is about impartiality but to many others it is about free speech. Indeed, there is a statue outside the BBC's headquarters in London of the author of 1984, George Orwell, a former BBC talks producer. Inscribed on the wall behind the Orwell statue are these words: \"If liberty means anything at all it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.\"\n\nEighty years after Orwell left the BBC, the corporation finds itself in a deepening crisis. That thought from Orwell and the questions it raises for the BBC are at the very heart of the Lineker debate.", "Captain Sir Tom Moore became famous for his fundraising efforts during the first coronavirus lockdown\n\nThe \u00a338m raised by Captain Sir Tom Moore when he walked 100 laps of his Bedfordshire garden is \"not under investigation\", the charity which received it has said.\n\nNHS Charities Together said money it received for its Covid-19 Urgent Appeal had \"funded thousands of projects\".\n\nIt said the Captain Tom Foundation, set up after his death, is a \"completely separate organisation\" to it.\n\nThe foundation is subject to an ongoing inquiry into its finances.\n\nCapt Sir Tom, who was born in Keighley, West Yorkshire, died in 2021 aged 100.\n\nHe became an international figure, during the start of the first coronavirus lockdown in 2020, for his fundraising walks in the grounds of his family home in Marston Moretaine.\n\nCapt Sir Tom won the nation's hearts with his fundraising walk, which took in 100 laps of his garden\n\nAfter he died, his family set up the Captain Tom Foundation, which is no longer taking donations or making payments due to a Charity Commission inquiry, which started a year ago.\n\nAnnouncing the probe, the commission said \"concerns have mounted\" over the charity and independence from a business run by Capt Sir Tom's family.\n\nAn NHS Charities Together spokesman said: \"The Captain Tom Foundation is a completely separate organisation that was established after Captain Tom did his fundraising for our Covid-19 Urgent Appeal, and the Charity Commission has made clear that the \u00a338m he raised for NHS Charities Together is not under investigation.\"\n\nA statement added that its Covid appeal raised more than \u00a3160m from thousands of supporters which had been \"distributed across the network of NHS charities to reach every NHS Trust and Health Board in the UK\".\n\n\"It has funded thousands of projects and provided vital mental health support for NHS staff, training for emergency volunteers, equipment and support for patients, and community partnership programmes to prevent ill health and reduce pressure on NHS services,\" the statement said.\n\n\"The support we continue to provide has never been more vital, and we are thankful to everyone who helps make it possible.\"\n\nA Covid appeal progress report on its website \"demonstrates the difference donations\" are making, the charity said.\n\nRecently, the younger of his two daughters, Hannah Ingram-Moore, who lived with Capt Sir Tom, has been told to knock down an unauthorised building used as a home spa.\n\nThe spa (the C-shaped building to the right of the pond) is at the home where Capt Sir Tom Moore walked 100 laps of the garden in 2020\n\nThe building on the site of the family home - for the use of the occupiers and the Captain Tom Foundation - had received planning permission in August 2021 and had been partly constructed when revised plans submitted in February 2022 including a spa pool, toilets and a kitchen, \"for private use\".\n\nThese revised plans for what was called the Captain Tom Building were turned down by Central Bedfordshire Council in November 2022.\n\nNeither The Captain Tom Moore Foundation nor Ms Ingram-Moore have responded to the BBC's request for comment on the planning application.\n\nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Gently gripping the patient's gall bladder. But the grasping device was not physically connected to anything - it appeared to be levitating inside the person's body.\n\nIn reality, the jaws were being controlled remotely by a robot arm wielding a special magnet.\n\n\"We could see the critical structures, the blood vessels,\" says Dr Matthew Kroh of the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. It wasn't long before he had removed the troublesome gall bladder with the help of his robotic assistant. This was one of two dozen or so similar surgeries he and his team have performed in recent months using their high-tech system.\n\n\"It allows us to do a very common operation in a less invasive way,\" he says, explaining that fewer incisions are now required for procedures such as this. But there are many other emerging applications that also use carefully manufactured magnets.\n\nPermanent magnets, the kind that keep colourful souvenirs stuck to the door of your fridge, might seem a fairly mature, well-established technology. They've been used for centuries, after all. And yet, today, researchers and companies are expending huge efforts on making magnets more powerful and efficient than ever before.\n\nThis is because, increasingly, magnets are used in all kinds of ascendant technologies - including EV motors and wind turbines. They are, therefore, crucial for electrification. However, magnets are generally made using rare earth elements, the products of dirty mining operations. And, at present, China massively dominates global permanent magnet production, with more than 90% market share.\n\nMany argue that we need cleaner and more widely distributed magnet manufacturing facilities. The future, they say, depends on it.\n\n\"My job is brilliant,\" says Matthew Swallow, technical product manager for Bunting Magnetics in the UK. \"Nobody else, I don't think, gets involved in so many things.\"\n\nHis firm makes magnets that are used in all kinds of systems - from cochlear implants, to emergency brakes on rollercoasters, including at Alton Towers. Bunting Magnetics has even supplied magnets to Nasa.\n\nMatthew Swallow says magnets have become much more powerful over the past 10 years\n\nMr Swallow says that, even during the past 10 years or so, the availability of higher grade magnets made with the rare earth element neodymium has improved. For such magnets designed to cope with temperatures up to 200C, a grade of N35 used to be the maximum. But now N52 grade versions are commercially available.\n\n\"You can literally make the magnet 60% less massive and get the same level of performance,\" explains Mr Swallow.\n\nIn an electric motor, a magnetic field helps an internal coil to spin. This might be used to drive an axle and turn the wheels of an electric car, for example. Higher grade magnets mean motors that run more efficiently and cars that weigh slightly less overall. The careful addition of a small amount of dysprosium, another rare earth element, is one way to improve a magnet's efficiency.\n\nOne reason why China dominates global production of these magnets is financial incentives, says Ross Embleton, senior analyst for metals & mining - rare earths at Wood Mackenzie. Rare earth permanent magnet material is subject to a 13% VAT discount on export from the country, and provincial governments give support on energy costs, for example, which also helps buoy up magnet-making facilities.\n\n\"It's a really, really challenging industry to compete in if you're outside of China,\" says Mr Embleton.\n\nThat hasn't stopped some from trying. US firm Niron Magnetics says it has managed to make good quality magnets without rare earths. Instead, they use iron and nitrogen to make iron nitride magnets. This relies on getting the iron nitride to take on a specific crystalline structure, which generates magnetic fields.\n\nChief executive Jonathan Rowntree declines to explain his company's production techniques in detail, but he says Niron has already produced working magnets. The first of these will be used in speakers.\n\nMagnetic field strength is measured in terms of teslas, and Niron's magnets are currently at one tesla. Mr Rowntree says it should be possible to make significantly more powerful magnets, up to 2.4 teslas, with iron nitride.\n\nAlternatively, recycling magnets would also be much better for the environment compared with making new rare earth magnets from scratch.\n\nIn the UK, the University of Birmingham has developed a method for extracting rare earth alloys from old electric motors and computer hard drives, for example.\n\nA spin out company, HyProMag, has now successfully extracted rare earths using the technology, and aims to begin commercial production of magnets using such material later this year.\n\nMeanwhile, US firm Noveon Magnetics says it has developed its own method for magnet recycling. When asked about the process, and the grades of magnets produced, chief commercial officer Peter Afiuny declined to go into details, except to say that a small amount of alloy is mixed with recovered material to achieve the desired result. The whole process is about 40% more efficient than traditional virgin magnet production.\n\nIt can be difficult to know the quality of an old magnet from a disused consumer electronics device, however, says Mr Embleton. And sometimes magnets are stuck into products with hard epoxy resins, making them tricky to remove.\n\nBut gradually, as early generations of EV motors and wind turbines reach the end of their lifespans in the coming years, more magnetic material is expected to become available for recycling.\n\n\"There's a bit of a delay there waiting for that material to come back again,\" says Mr Embleton. Companies have an opportunity to perfect their recycling processes in the meantime.\n\nNiron's targeting of the audio speakers market is interesting, says Nicola Morley at the University of Sheffield. \"It means they think they can produce them cheaply - that market has other cheap permanent magnets in it,\" she explains. Within the last decade, the development of magnet technology has really begun to accelerate, adds Prof Morley.\n\nAnd Mr Swallow cites other emerging applications that sound quite sci-fi - including magnets mounted on satellites to scoop up space debris orbiting Earth.\n\nDr Kroh says he is looking forward to even more sophisticated magnets that will make other surgeries less invasive than before. Chest surgery involving the lungs, or endoscopies, for instance, could one day be performed with the help of such technology.\n\n\"It's almost limitless,\" he says. \"This is just the beginning.\"", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nFrance has seen a quieter night of protests over the death of a teenager shot by police at point-blank range, the interior minister says.\n\nThere were fewer arrests compared to previous nights - 719 - with the worst clashes in the southern city Marseille.\n\nIn the Paris suburb L'Ha\u00ff-les-Roses, attackers rammed a car into the house of the mayor, injuring his wife as she tried to flee with their two children.\n\nFrench cities have seen unrest since the police shooting of a teenager.\n\nNahel M, 17, was shot during a traffic stop on Tuesday.

His lawyer said he was devastated.\n\nNahel's death has reignited debate around the state of French policing, including a controversial 2017 firearms law which allows officers to shoot when a driver ignores an order to stop.\n\nMore widely, it has led to questions of racism in the force. The UN's human rights office said the unrest was a chance for France \"to address deep issues of racism in law enforcement\".\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron condemned the violence on Friday \"with the greatest firmness\" and said Nahel's death had been used to justify acts of violence - calling it an \"unacceptable exploitation of the adolescent's death\".", "This is the worst leak of US intelligence for 10 years.\n\nNot since former National Security Agency employee Edward Snowden and former US Army soldier Chelsea Manning published classified documents has so much supposedly secret intelligence leaked into the public domain.\n\nThe damage is on several levels.

His grounds for appeal are unknown.\n\nThe former special forces corporal sued three Australian newspapers over a series of articles alleging serious misconduct while he was deployed in Afghanistan between 2009-2012 as part of a US-led military coalition.\n\nAt the time the articles were published in 2018, Mr Roberts-Smith was considered a national hero, having been awarded Australia's highest military honour for single-handedly overpowering Taliban fighters attacking his Special Air Service (SAS) platoon.\n\nThe 44-year-old claimed the papers ruined his life with their reports that he had broken the moral and legal rules of war.\n\nHis defamation case - dubbed by some \"the trial of the century\" - lasted 110 days and was rumoured to have cost up to A$25m ($16.3m; \u00a313.2m).\n\nOn 1 June a Federal Court judge threw out the case against The Age, The Sydney Morning Herald, and The Canberra Times, ruling it was \"substantially true\" that Mr Roberts-Smith had murdered unarmed Afghan prisoners and civilians and bullied fellow soldiers.\n\nJustice Anthony Besanko also found that Mr Roberts-Smith lied to cover up his misconduct and threatened witnesses.\n\nAdditional allegations that he had punched his lover, threatened a peer, and committed two other murders were not proven to the \"balance of probabilities\" standard required in civil cases.\n\nMr Roberts-Smith, who left the defence force in 2013, has not been charged over any of the claims in a criminal court, where there is a higher burden of proof.\n\nNone of the evidence presented in the civil defamation case against Mr Roberts-Smith can be used in any criminal proceedings, meaning investigators must gather their own independently.\n\nBut the case has raised the spectre of a possible wider reckoning over claims of war crimes by Australian forces.\n\nIn 2020, a landmark investigation known as the Brereton Report found \"credible evidence\" that elite Australian soldiers unlawfully killed 39 people in Afghanistan.\n\nIt recommended that 19 current or former soldiers should be investigated over alleged killings of prisoners and civilians from 2009-13.\n\nAustralian troops were deployed to Afghanistan between 2001 and 2021, as part of a US-led coalition that ousted the Taliban after the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United States. The Taliban retook control of Afghanistan in 2021.", "Berlusconi was a major public figure in Italian business, broadcasting, and politics\n\nIn the labyrinthine world of Italian politics, Silvio Berlusconi was the supreme wheeler-dealer - a man who merged business and public life like no other.\n\nHis flamboyant personality struck a chord with the Italian electorate, which continued to back him despite allegations of corruption and double-dealing.\n\nFour times he was prime minister, and each time it seemed his political career was over, he managed to confound his critics and bounce back.\n\nNine years after he was banned from public office for tax fraud, he was back in parliament, elected to Italy's Senate before he turned 86 in September 2022.\n\nBut it was often his private life - his fondness for surrounding himself with beautiful young women, and the ensuing sexual scandals - that made headlines around the world.\n\nBerlusconi, who has died at the age of 86, was a media mogul, football club owner and billionaire businessman who never gave up on politics - and helped shape Italy's image for decades.\n\nSilvio Berlusconi was born into a middle-class family in Milan on 29 September 1936 and grew up in a village outside the city during World War Two.\n\nFrom his student days, he demonstrated the ability to make money. While studying law at university, he played double-bass in a student band - and developed a reputation as a singer, working in nightclubs and on cruise ships.\n\nBerlusconi had a spell as a singer on cruise ships\n\nHis first foray into using his natural charm for business was as a vacuum cleaner salesman and in selling essays written for his fellow students.\n\nAfter graduation, he started in construction with his own company, Edilnord, building an enormous apartment complex on the edge of Milan - though the source of funding for the project was something of a mystery.\n\nIn 1973, the entrepreneur launched a local cable television company called Telemilano to provide television to his properties.\n\nFour years later, he owned two more stations and a central Milan studio. By the end of the decade, he had created a holding company, Fininvest, to manage the rapid expansion of his business holdings.\n\nEventually, it would own Mediaset - Italy's largest media empire and owner of the country's biggest private stations - and Italy's largest publishing house, Mondadori.\n\nBy the time of his death, he was one of Italy's richest men, with a family fortune in the billions of dollars. His children - Marina, Barbara, Pier Silvio, Eleonora and Luigi - have all taken part in the running of his business empire.\n\nSome of that wealth would be used to indulge his personal interests - including saving his hometown football club AC Milan from bankruptcy in 1986.\n\nThe football club AC Milan was just one of his business interests\n\nThat investment would pay off three decades later in 2017, when he sold the club to Chinese investors for \u00a3628m (\u20ac740m).\n\nHe never gave up on football either, later buying Monza football club and enjoying its rise to the top flight of Serie A for the first time in its history.\n\nBerlusconi's remarkable ability to face down the courts repeatedly - and maintain his popularity in politics - was unrivalled.\n\nHe often complained of victimisation - particularly by prosecutors in his native Milan - once claiming to have made 2,500 court appearances in 106 trials over 20 years.\n\nCharges over the years have included embezzlement, tax fraud and false accounting, and attempting to bribe a judge. He was acquitted or had his convictions overturned on several occasions.\n\nHis controversies were highly public and formed a regular backdrop throughout his political career. It was not until February 2023 that he was finally cleared of bribing witnesses to lie about the notorious \"bunga bunga\" parties he had held at his villa as prime minister.\n\nHe had founded his own political party 30 years earlier in 1993 and within a year, he was catapulted to power.\n\nLeveraging his enthusiasm for football, he named his party after a supporters' chant - Forza Italia (Go Italy). At the time, a power vacuum had emerged in the wake of a scandal affecting Italy's centre-right - and Berlusconi offered an alternative to those voters that was not leftist.\n\nA massive advertising campaign on his own TV channels had helped propel him to victory in the 1994 election.\n\nHowever, his new appetite for politics was seen as a bid to avoid being implicated in corruption charges himself, after several of his businesses were drawn into the investigation.\n\nBut he dismissed the claims. \"I don't need to go into office for the power. I have houses all over the world, stupendous boats, beautiful airplanes, a beautiful wife, a beautiful family. I am making a sacrifice.\"\n\nOnce he was in power, Berlusconi's government passed a law that gave him, and other top public figures, immunity from prosecution while in office, but it was later thrown out by the constitutional court.\n\nBerlusconi's first coalition lasted only a few months - partly owing to friction between the different parties in it, and partly because of Berlusconi's indictment for alleged tax fraud by a Milan court.\n\nHe lost the 1996 election to the Left - but his political career was only just beginning.\n\nIn 2001, Berlusconi was back as prime minister, at the head of a new coalition known as House of Freedoms. The main plank of his election campaign was a promise to overhaul the Italian economy, simplify the tax system and raise pensions.\n\nBut Italy's finances were suffering in a worsening global economy, and Berlusconi was unable to fulfil his pledges. He lost to the Left in 2006 - but won again in 2008.\n\nHe remained a fixture in Italian politics until 2011, which would prove among his most challenging years.\n\nItaly's borrowing costs soared during the eurozone debt crisis. The prime minister haemorrhaged support and was forced to resign after losing his parliamentary majority.\n\nThe same year, the constitutional court struck down part of the law granting him and other senior ministers temporary immunity.\n\nBerlusconi eventually carried out community service as part of his conviction for tax fraud\n\nBy the end of 2011, he was out of power. In October 2012, he was sentenced to four years' imprisonment for tax fraud and barred from public office. Berlusconi declared his innocence and spoke of a \"judicial coup\".\n\nBut by then, he was over 75 years of age and was handed community service instead. He worked four hours a week with elderly dementia patients at a Catholic care home near Milan.\n\nHe was also banned from public office - a prohibition which lasted for several years before his next comeback.\n\nBeyond politics, Berlusconi made headlines for his private life, which was often very public.\n\nThe flamboyant prime minister did not hide his pursuit of younger women. His most recent partner, party colleague Marta Fascina, is more than 50 years his junior. He was known to use hair transplants and plastic surgery to make himself seem younger.\n\nHe met his second wife, Veronica Lario, after she performed topless in a play. She would go on to express frustration publicly with her husband's behaviour around young women on more than one occasion.\n\nShe filed for divorce after her husband was photographed at the 18th birthday party of model Noemi Letizia.\n\nHis most high-profile scandal was the alleged \"bunga bunga\" parties at his villa, attended by showgirls - a story which ended in a conviction for paying an underage prostitute for sex.\n\nAmid the scandal, both Silvio Berlusconi and Karima El Mahroug denied they had sex\n\nIt eventually emerged that in 2010, Berlusconi, while prime minister, had telephoned a police station and asked for the release of 17-year-old Karima \"Ruby\" El Mahroug, nicknamed Ruby Heart-Stealer, who was being held for theft. She was also a reported guest of the \"bunga bunga\" parties.\n\nItalian media reported that the prime minister had claimed the girl was the niece or granddaughter of the president of Egypt, and he was attempting to avoid a diplomatic incident.\n\nBerlusconi was found guilty of paying her for sex and abusing his power in 2013 - but that ruling was overturned the following year.\n\nFor his part, Berlusconi always rejected claims he had paid any woman for sex, saying to do so was \"missing the pleasure of conquest\". But he also admitted he was \"no saint\".\n\nBeset by national budgetary problems and embroiled in personal scandals, Berlusconi's People of Freedom party did poorly in 2011 local elections, losing Milan, his home town and power base.\n\nBut he remained popular, coming within 1% of winning the 2013 national elections. Eventually, his party split - and Berlusconi relaunched it under its original name, Forza Italia.\n\nBetween his electoral defeats and the ban on holding public office because of his criminal conviction, it might have seemed that his political career was over.\n\nIn 2019, Berlusconi ran for election himself once more - and won\n\nYet Forza Italia came third in the 2018 elections with Berlusconi's name attached to its branding, behind the populist, anti-establishment Five Star and Forza Italia's own right-wing electoral partner, the League.\n\nBerlusconi promised to \"loyally support\" League leader Matteo Salvini's efforts to form a government - but the League chose to rule without Forza Italia.\n\nOnce again, it seemed like Berlusconi's political career might be coming to a close. But in 2018, a court ruled that he could, once again, stand for public office - declaring him \"rehabilitated\".\n\nThe decision came too late for the 2018 elections, but in 2019 the eternal vote-winner announced he was running for the European Parliament. As the top candidate on his party's lists, he easily won himself a European seat.\n\nThree years later, he was back in Italy's parliament and his Forza Italia a junior party in Giorgia Meloni's right-wing coalition.\n\nWith his slicked-back dark hair and raunchy scandals, Berlusconi was instantly recognisable and cultivated a larger-than-life personality.\n\nHe also became notorious for his questionable sense of humour after a number of high-profile gaffes. On one occasion, he suggested a German MEP would have made a good concentration camp guard - and on another, claimed Mussolini was actually a benign leader.\n\nHe dismissed these statements as jokes. However, he was also a long-time friend of Vladimir Putin and blamed Ukraine for Russia's invasion when his own government was strongly behind Kyiv.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nIt is probably his involvement in almost every aspect of Italian life that angered his critics most - particularly his media empire, which, many say, gave him an unfair advantage at elections.\n\nThe many Italians who voted for him felt his success as a business tycoon was evidence of his capabilities, a reason why he should run the country.\n\nBerlusconi himself dismissed claims that mixing business and politics had been more beneficial to him personally than to Italy as a whole.\n\n\"If in taking care of everyone's interests, I also take care of my own, you can't talk about a conflict of interest,\" he declared.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "Fawziyah Javed was pregnant when she died\n\nA man's description of his wife as a \"disease\" was relevant to his state of mind moments before he allegedly murdered her, a court has heard.\n\nKashif Anwar, 29, from Leeds, Yorkshire, denies pushing his pregnant wife Fawziyah Javed, 31, to her death at Arthur's Seat in September 2021.\n\nAlex Prentice KC told the High Court in Edinburgh that the only \"just verdict\" was to convict the accused of murder.\n\nHe highlighted evidence of what Mr Anwar allegedly said to his wife.\n\nMr Prentice gave his closing speech on the sixth day of proceedings against Mr Anwar after defence advocate Ian Duguid KC told judge Lord Beckett that his client would not be giving evidence.\n\nThe court previously heard as Ms Javed, from Pudsey, near Leeds, lay dying she told witnesses that her husband had pushed her.\n\nThe advocate depute said: \"We heard about how if one of them died in childbirth, of how good that would be.\n\n\"We also heard of how he said she was a disease in everybody's life and of how he said to her 'the sooner you are dead or the sooner you are out of everybody's life the better.'\n\n\"I say that is relevant to his state of mind when he was on Arthur's Seat and it is relevant to Fawziyah Javed's last words as she lay there dying on the slopes of Arthur's Seat.\"\n\nMr Prentice also urged jurors to consider evidence about the couple's relationship, such as Ms Javed contacting a firm of solicitors in the months before she died to seek advice about getting a divorce.\n\nMs Javed's mother also gave evidence on her daughter's abuse code words.\n\nThe jury heard that if her daughter texted \"I need cream cakes\", she would treat it as a sign that she was in danger of being abused by Mr Anwar.\n\nMr Prentice said: \"If you consider the evidence as a whole - not in isolation, you will be able to see that this was a controlling, abusive and increasingly volatile relationship.\n\n\"She wanted to end the relationship. He said that if she wanted to end the relationship he would ruin her.\"\n\nDefence advocate Ian Duguid KC later urged jurors to acquit his client of murder.\n\nHe told them that Mr Anwar \"came across as a horrible person\" during the presentation of the evidence.\n\nMr Duguid said he could understand if the jury sympathised with Ms Javed as the evidence showed she was a \"perfectly respectable woman\".\n\nHowever, the advocate told the jury that they had to put such feelings aside.\n\nHe added: \"You have no evidence about what happened on the hill.\n\n\"You have no eyewitness telling about what happened.

Watch: The debt ceiling explained - in under 90 seconds\n\nPresident Joe Biden and Republican leaders have expressed cautious optimism that a deal to raise the US debt ceiling is within reach, following emergency talks at the White House.\n\nBut House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy told reporters the two sides are still far apart.\n\nThe standoff has forced Mr Biden to cut short a foreign trip.\n\nWithout a deal, the US could enter a calamitous default on its $31.4tr (\u00a325tr) debt as soon as 1 June.\n\nA failure by the US government to meet its debt obligations could trigger global financial chaos.\n\nThe Democratic president said Tuesday's hour-long Oval Office meeting was \"good, productive\", sounding upbeat about the prospects of an agreement.\n\nMr McCarthy said afterwards he believed a deal was possible by the end of this week.\n\nAsked about the risk of the US falling off a fiscal cliff, the California congressman told BBC News: \"The great thing about that question is we've already taken default off the table.\"\n\nHe also told reporters a Biden-appointed representative would negotiate directly with his staff, which he said was a sign that \"the structure of how we negotiate has improved\".\n\nA number of senior Democrats were at the talks, including Vice-President Kamala Harris, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.\n\nIn exchange for support for raising the debt ceiling, Republican leaders are demanding budget cuts. They also want tougher work requirements on government aid recipients.\n\nCiting sources familiar with the talks, the Associated Press news agency reports that this idea was \"resoundingly\" rejected by House Democrats at another meeting earlier on Tuesday.\n\nMr Biden has repeatedly said that a potential debt default and budgetary issues should be separate.\n\nThe president is due to fly to the G7 summit in Japan on Wednesday. He was then expected to head to Papua New Guinea and Australia for further meetings.\n\nBut he will now return after the 19-21 May summit ends in Hiroshima to \"ensure that Congress takes action\" to avert a default, the White House said in a statement.\n\nThe so-called Quad meeting in Sydney has now been cancelled, and the leaders will attempt to meet on the sidelines of the G7, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said.\n\nReaching the debt ceiling would mean the US government is unable to borrow any more money.\n\nThis means the government would no longer be able to pay the salaries of federal and military employees. Social Security cheques - payments that millions of pensioners in the US rely on - would stop.\n\nEvery so often the US Congress votes to raise or suspend the ceiling so it can borrow more.\n\nA default - which would be a first in US history - could shatter trust in America's political ability to pay its bills.\n\nExperts have warned it could also see the US spiral into recession and trigger a rise in unemployment.\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen said at an event on Tuesday that \"a US default would generate an economic and financial catastrophe\".\n\nMeanwhile, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said: \"There's countries like Russia and China that would love nothing more than for us to default.\"\n\nA deal to avoid this scenario has so far proven elusive. In April, Republicans proposed an agreement that would suspend the debt limit by $1.5tn or until 31 March, whichever comes first.\n\nIn exchange, they would maintain spending at key government agencies at 2022 levels for the next financial year and limit spending growth to 1% annually over the next 10 years.\n\nThey argued this would lead to $4.8tn in savings.\n\nThe proposal, however, would scupper several of Mr Biden's legislative priorities, including student loan forgiveness.\n\nThe last time the US was approaching a default, back in 2011, lawmakers struck a deal hours before the deadline.\n\nThat standoff led to a downgrade in the US credit rating, sent the stock market plummeting and increased the government's borrowing costs.\n\n\"Nobody should use default as a hostage,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said at the US Capitol on Tuesday. \"The consequences would be devastating for America.\"\n\nThe US debt ceiling has been raised, extended or revised 78 times since 1960.", "The company behind Boots the Chemist is to close 300 of its branches throughout the UK over the next 12 months.\n\nThe US-owners of the pharmacy chain said they will shut down stores in close proximity to each other as part of plans to \"consolidate\" the business.\n\nThe BBC understands there will be no redundancies and staff will be offered work at nearby stores.\n\nThere will be 1,900 branches left across the UK from a base of 2,200.\n\nIt is not yet known which locations will be affected.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance said on Tuesday, as it delivered its quarterly results statement, that the move was part of a \"transformation plan\".\n\nThe company said it had seen a surge in people shopping online and choosing own-brand labels as customers looked to save money.\n\nRetail sales went up by 13.4% in the three months to the end of May, compared with the same period last year. Its \"Everyday\" essentials label saw volume growth of 40%.\n\nEarlier this year the retailer courted controversy after it changed the way its loyalty card worked by offering discounts on more of its own-brand products, but reducing the points earned per pound.\n\nIn 2020, Walgreens cut 4,000 jobs at the health and beauty chain and closed some of its shops as the Covid-19 pandemic hit sales.\n\nThe company was recently a victim of cyber-crime when it was targeted, along with a host of other organisations including the BBC and BA, in a world-wide hack.", "Plant more trees - one of the report's recommendations\n\nGovernment backing for new oil and coal, airport expansion plans and slow progress on heat pumps show that the UK has lost its leadership on climate issues, a government watchdog warns.\n\nThe Climate Change Committee (CCC) described government efforts to scale up climate action as \"worryingly slow\".\n\nIt was \"markedly\" less confident than a year ago that the UK would reach its targets for cutting carbon emissions.\n\nThe government said it was committed to its climate targets.\n\nCommittee chairman Lord Deben, a former Conservative environment minister, was particularly critical of the government's policy on new coal and oil projects.\n\nThe decision to approve the UK's first new deep coal mine in 30 years in Cumbria last December was \"total nonsense\", he told the BBC.\n\nLord Deben was also damning about plans for a major new oilfield off the coast of Scotland. Approval for Rosebank, which could produce an estimated 300 million barrels of oil in its lifetime, is expected soon.\n\n\"How can we ask countries in Africa not to develop oil?\" Lord Deben said. \"How can we ask other nations not to expand the fossil fuel production if we start doing it ourselves?\"\n\nThe government proposed the first new coal mine in 30 years in Whitehaven, Cumbria\n\nThe UK has set legally binding targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, meaning the country will no longer contribute any additional greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.\n\nAt the COP26 UN climate conference in Glasgow in 2021 then prime minister Boris Johnson vowed to cut emissions by 68% on 1990 levels by the end of the decade.\n\nThe CCC report warned \"continued delays in policy development and implementation\" meant reaching them was \"increasingly challenging\".\n\nThe Committee highlighted a \"lack of urgency\" across government and a \"worrying hesitancy\" by ministers to lead on the climate issue.\n\nMinister of State for Energy Security and Net Zero Graham Stuart said in response to the report that the government had met all its carbon targets to date and was confident of doing so in the future.\n\nResponding to criticism for continued support for oil and gas projects, he stressed that despite an unprecedented role for renewables, the UK would remain dependent on these sources for power generation for the foreseeable future.\n\n\"There is no button I can press tomorrow, and as we will be dependent on oil and gas for decades to come, even as we move to net zero, it makes sense that we should produce it here,\" he told journalists.\n\nRegarding the new coal mine in Cumbria, he stressed that it would produce coking coal for making steel, not for energy production and that there was currently no alternative.\n\nRebecca Newsom, head of politics for Greenpeace UK called the report \"a pitiful catalogue of Rishi Sunak's climate failures\".\n\n\"This report exposes the catastrophic negligence shown by this government which has left Britain with higher bills, fewer good jobs, our energy security weakened, and the climate emergency unaddressed,\" said Labour's Shadow Climate and Net Zero Secretary Ed Miliband.\n\nThe chair of the COP26 summit, Alok Sharma, agreed the UK was at risk of losing what he called its \"international reputation and influence on climate\".\n\nHe said the country risked falling behind without a response to initiatives like the US's vast subsidies for green industries.\n\n\"Resting on our laurels is definitely not the answer industry is seeking,\" he said, one of the sharpest criticisms the Conservative MP has made of the government's climate policy.\n\nMore needs to be done to encourage us all to install heat pumps, insulate our homes, reduce how much meat we eat and fly less, the Committee said.\n\nAt the same time, it said, the switch to renewable power needs to be ramped up, industry needs more help to decarbonise and there needs to be a huge increase in the numbers of trees planted and the speed of peatland restoration.\n\nThe report acknowledged that glimmers of the Net Zero transition can be seen in growing sales of electric cars and the growing renewable power sector.\n\nBut it warned the government continues to rely on unproven technological solutions rather than \"more straightforward\" encouragement of people to reduce high-carbon activities.\n\nThe report criticised plans for new airport expansion, saying we should be encouraged to fly less\n\nThe Committee says the government should be doing more to encourage us to fly less rather than relying on the development of sustainable fuels to reduce the carbon emissions from aviation, for example.\n\nIt pointed out that lots of UK airports are planning to expand capacity despite a CCC recommendation that there should be no net airport expansion. Seven out of the 10 major UK airports have plans to expand, according to BBC research.\n\nLord Deben, whose second and final term as chair of the CCC ends this month, said that one of the government's biggest failures was not putting net zero at the heart of the UK's planning system.\n\n\"If you pass laws in order to do something and then don't provide the means, then you're failing,\" he told the BBC.\n\nHe said he was sad his final report \"does not show satisfactory progress\".\n\nUK greenhouse gas emissions have fallen 46% from 1990 levels, the CCC says, largely thanks to a massive reduction in the use of coal for electricity and the growth of the renewable power sector.", "Thousands of troops have been sent in to Manipur to help stop the violence\n\nAt least 30 people have been killed in ethnic clashes in the north-eastern Indian state of Manipur, officials say.\n\nThe violence began earlier this week after a rally by indigenous communities against moves to grant tribal status to the main ethnic group in the state.\n\nMobs attacked homes, vehicles, churches, and temples.

It is too soon to say they're in the clear. This is the beginning of their mission to establish trust.\n\nOne of the CBI's core functions is to speak with the government on behalf of businesses.\n\nThe government paused any activity with the CBI following allegations of sexual misconduct at the group which were revealed in the Guardian newspaper.\n\nAsked whether it would now re-engage with the CBI following the vote, a spokesperson for the Department of Business and Trade said: \"While this is a matter for the CBI and their internal processes, we will continue to engage with businesses on a case-by-case basis and business groups where appropriate.\"\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak, in his former role as Chancellor, at a CBI event\n\nDanni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell, said the business lobby group still faced \"a long and tortuous slog back from the brink\", adding it would take time to rebuild confidence.\n\n\"It's bought a little of that time today but if it can't win over the government, if it can't find its way back into the room, then it has no real value.\"\n\nWhile the CBI claims to represent 190,000 firms, not all of these are direct members - the number of which is thought to be substantially smaller.\n\nThe lobby group works with trade associations which represent thousands of firms, such as the National Farmers' Union which has 50,000 members.\n\nAt Tuesday's vote, each member had one vote each regardless of size. That means that a trade association that might represent thousands of companies had one vote.\n\nAlthough the CBI has won the backing of its remaining members, a recent exodus of fee-paying companies is already affecting the organisation.\n\nAnd some - like Rolls-Royce - said its membership of the CBI remains on pause.\n\nA spokesperson said: \"We will monitor the implementation of the reforms detailed in the prospectus.

Eight of those arrested had been police officers.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the family's lawyer Raju Bhatt said the nine commissioners in office since the murder had come to represent \"consistent failure of courage and integrity\".\n\nHe added: \"A perceived need to protect the organisation from reputational damage has served only to nurture and encourage a culture of impunity.\n\n\"Whether or how Sir Mark and his senior leadership choose to face up to that sickness and translate the words of his apology into reality is his challenge.\n\n\"What the Met owes this family is a bit of gratitude for exposing a culture of impunity.\"\n\nThe family and the police said the \"mutually satisfactory\" terms of the agreement would remain confidential.\n\nFollow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Meanwhile, accounts with \"verified\" status are currently limited to 10,000 posts a day.\n\nThe tech billionaire initially set stricter limits, but he changed these within hours of announcing the move.\n\nMr Musk said the temporary limits were to address \"extreme levels of data scraping and system manipulation\".\n\nHe did not explain what was meant by system manipulation in this context.\n\n\"We were getting data pillaged so much that it was degrading service for normal users,\" Mr Musk explained on Friday, after users were presented with screens asking them to log in to view Twitter content.\n\nThe move was described as a \"temporary emergency measure\".\n\nIt is not totally clear what Mr Musk is referring to by data scraping, but it appears he means the scraping of large amounts of data used by artificial intelligence (AI) companies to train large language models, which power chatbots such as Open AI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard.\n\nIn simple terms, data scraping is the pulling of information from the internet. Large language models need to learn from masses of real human conversations. But the quality is vital to the success of a chatbot. Reddit and Twitter's huge trove of billions of posts are thought to be hugely important training data - and used by AI companies.\n\nBut platforms like Twitter and Reddit want to be paid for this data.\n\nIn April, Reddit's chief executive Steve Huffman told the New York Times that he was unhappy with what AI companies were doing.\n\n\"The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,\" he said. \"But we don't need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.\"\n\nTwitter has already started charging users to access its application programming interface (API), which is often used by third party apps and researchers - which can include AI companies.\n\nThere are other potential reasons for the move too.\n\nMr Musk has been pushing people towards Twitter Blue, its paid subscription service. It's possible he is looking at a model where users will have to pay to get a full Twitter service - and access to unlimited posts.\n\nSignalled by a blue tick, \"verified\" status was given for free by Twitter to high-profile accounts before Mr Musk took over as its boss. Now, most users have to pay a subscription fee from $8 (\u00a36.30) per month to be verified, and can gain the status regardless of their profile.\n\nAccording to the website Downdetector - which tracks online outages - a peak of 5,126 people reported problems accessing the platform in the UK at 16:12 BST on Saturday.\n\nIn the US, roughly 7,461 people reported glitches around the same time.\n\nInitially, Mr Musk announced reading limits of 6,000 posts per day for verified accounts, 600 for unverified accounts, and 300 for new unverified accounts.\n\nIn another update Mr Musk said \"several hundred organisations (maybe more) were scraping Twitter data extremely aggressively\".\n\nHe later indicated there had been a burden on his website, saying it was \"rather galling to have to bring large numbers of servers online on an emergency basis\".\n\nA server is a powerful computer that manages and stores files, providing services such as web pages for users.\n\nAdam Leon Smith from BCS, the UK's professional body for IT, said the move was \"very odd\" as limiting users' scroll time would affect the company's advertising revenue.\n\nMr Musk bought the company last year for $44bn (\u00a335bn) after much back and forth. He was critical of Twitter's previous management and said he did not want the platform to become an echo chamber.\n\nSoon after taking over, he cut the workforce from just under 8,000 staff to about 1,500.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC, he said that cutting the workforce had not been easy.\n\nEngineers were included in the layoffs and their exit raised concerns about the platform's stability.\n\nBut while Mr Musk acknowledged some glitches, he told the BBC in April that outages had not lasted very long and the site was working fine.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.", "Peter Murrell's home has been searched by police\n\nFormer SNP chief executive Peter Murrell has been released without charge by the police, pending further investigation into party finances.\n\nMr Murrell, 58, the husband of former first minister Nicola Sturgeon, was arrested on Wednesday morning.\n\nHe was questioned while police searched their Glasgow home and SNP headquarters as part of their investigation.\n\nMs Sturgeon said she had \"no prior knowledge\" of Police Scotland's plans.

its second highest rate in 45 years.\n\nDowning Street sources have stressed that there are no plans for a mandatory price cap.\n\nThe idea of a cap or freeze on basic food items, as first reported by the Daily Telegraph, is said to be at the \"drawing board stage\".\n\nSupermarkets are expected to be allowed to select which items they would cap and only take part in the initiative, modelled on a similar agreement in France, on a voluntary basis.\n\nHealth Secretary Steve Barclay told BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that \"this is about having constructive discussions with supermarkets about how we work together, not about any element of compulsion\".\n\nHe added that the government was also keen to protect \"suppliers who themselves face considerable pressures\".\n\nFor Labour, shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Ashworth told the same programme that the reports were \"extraordinary\", saying \"Rishi Sunak is now like a latter day Edward Heath with price controls\".\n\nHowever there is some doubt over what impact a price cap of food will have.\n\nThe British Retail Consortium says that the government should focus more on cutting red tape rather than \"recreating 1970s-style price controls\".\n\n\"This will not make a jot of difference to prices.

But the problem between French suburbs and French police goes much deeper than occasional eruptions of fireworks and Molotov cocktails.\n\nDistrust and resentment smoulder beneath the surface in places like La Grande Borne, less visible than the weapons carried by gangs here, but just as likely to explode.\n\n\"When we intervene in an estate, there is fear on both sides,\" the officer said. \"But the police should not be afraid. Fear doesn't help in making the right choices.\"\n\nThe question now being asked, from the estates to the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, is how to prevent these tensions igniting again.\n\nDjigui Diarra is a film-maker who grew up in La Grande Borne, which is one of the poorest housing estates in France.\n\nDjigui Diarra has explored racial divisions between the community and police in his work\n\n\"My first encounter with police was when I was 10 years old,\" he explained, as we sat in the simple concrete playground he used to visit as a child, surrounded by low-rise apartment blocks.\n\nIt was a police identification check on an older member of his group, someone he saw as a \"big brother\".\n\n\"They were really rude, so my big brother responded and they put him down [on the ground],\" the 27-year-old said. \"This was my first encounter with police and as a kid I said to myself, 'this will be my natural enemy'\".\n\nThat was around the time that France scrapped community policing, known in the country as the \"police of proximity\" - something Djigui believes was a big mistake.\n\n\"With the police of proximity, there was a lack of violence, a lack of criminality,\" he said. \"The language [was] great; they respected people. You have to put people together to feel each other.\"\n\nNow they only come when there's trouble, he added.\n\nDjigui - whose name means \"hope\" in Mali's Bambara language - said he had been called \"gorilla\" and \"monkey\" by police officers during ID checks.\n\nFour years ago, he made a film called Malgr\u00e9 Eux (In Spite of Them) which explored the racial divisions between residents and police in his community.\n\nIt's something other community leaders, in other banlieues, bring up too.\n\nHassan Ben M'Barak says local police forces need to be more ethnically diverse\n\nIn Gennevilliers, on the other side of Paris, Hassan Ben M'Barak leads a network of local associations that was created during weeks of rioting back in 2005.\n\n\"We need at least 20% or 25% of the police who patrol the neighbourhood to come from minority ethnic backgrounds [or] to come from the neighbourhood,\" he said. \"That's a really important aspect.\"\n\nSince 2005, he explained, the situation has got harder to control - not only because of changes in policing, but changes in funding policy too, with money directed towards urban regeneration and away from local associations on the ground.\n\nWhat's striking this time, he said, was that \"no one - no association - has called for calm\" because they no longer have the authority to influence the situation.\n\nThis week, French media reported that the police officer charged with Nahel's homicide told investigators that he pulled the trigger because he was afraid the 17-year-old would drive off and \"drag\" his police colleague with him.\n\nThe traffic policeman, named as Florian M, also denied threatening to shoot the teenager in the head.\n\nThe shooting, and the riots that followed, dominated French media for days. But many believe media coverage here is just as important as policing and policy in fuelling divisions between the banlieues and the rest of France.\n\nThe riots started in the Pablo Picasso housing estate, not far from where Nahel M was fatally shot by a police officer\n\n\"They have to talk about great histories [stories] in the suburbs, not only when there are riots,\" Djigui said. \"That will reduce the racism and fear in others.\n\n\"And we in the suburbs have to consider every little brother, every little sister, as ours. We have to consider every member of this [estate] as our family.\"\n\nDjigui is now working on a new series about policing in France's suburbs, and said he believes that those beyond the banlieues are starting to wake up to his message.\n\n\"When the yellow vest strikes happened, they understood why we in the suburbs were, like, police brutality is abominable. I said to them, 'better late [than never]'.\"\n\nThe yellow vest protests, which broke out across France in 2017, sparked a national debate about police brutality after a number of protesters were seriously injured by police.\n\nFor now, though, the fires have subsided in the banlieues and so has the attention they brought. And the towering apartment blocks that ring France's prosperous cities are sinking out of sight again.", "Doug Paulley, one of four disability campaigners who had brought the case against the government, said they now planned to appeal against the latest ruling\n\nA ruling which decided a survey used to inform the government's National Disability Strategy was \"unlawful\" has been overturned at the Court of Appeal.\n\nThe strategy aims to improve disabled people's lives and tackle issues such as housing and inaccessible public transport.\n\nThe government has welcomed the Court of Appeal's decision and says the plans can now \"move forward again\".\n\nBut disability-rights campaigners plan to appeal against the latest ruling.\n\nThe High Court had found the survey of disabled people had failed to consult effectively.\n\nThe government had failed to provide enough information on the proposed strategy to allow for meaningful responses, campaigners had told the High Court.\n\nBut in the Court of Appeal, Lady Justice Laing ruled \"the purpose of the survey was to find out information and views which might 'inform' the strategy\" and those surveyed could not have been given more information about the strategy \"because it did not exist\".\n\nThe High Court judge had been wrong to rule the survey was subject to \"the Gunning requirement\", Lady Justice Laing said, and therefore wrong to rule the work and pensions secretary had acted unlawfully.\n\nThe Gunning principles include requiring public bodies to provide the information people need to contribute to a consultation and that the decision makers take the result into account.\n\nBut in January 2022, the High Court ruled Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey \"took on a duty to consult which she did not properly discharge and, as a result, the consultation she carried out, principally by means of the survey, was not lawful\".\n\nCampaigners Doug Paulley, Jean Eveleigh, Victoria Hon and Miriam Binder, who has since died, had brought the case against the government.\n\nMr Paulley said they now were \"really frustrated\" the ruling had been overturned - and they had \"lost on a technicality\".\n\n\"The original strategy and consultation was a travesty,\" he said. \"We feel it was a waste of money and time and an insult to disabled people.\"\n\nThe consultation \"didn't allow us to say anything on the important issues for disabled people\",\" Mr Paulley added.\n\nWhen details of the national Disability Strategy were announced, in 2021, charities welcomed some of the measures but said other aspects lacked scope and ambition.\n\nAfter the High Court ruling, a number of policies were paused, including proposals to ensure every disabled person who wanted to start a business had the opportunity and exploring how to increase opportunities for disabled people to serve in the armed-forces reserves.\n\nOn Tuesday, Disabled People, Health and Work Minister Tom Pursglove said: \"I welcome the Court of Appeal's judgment that our National Disability Strategy is lawful, meaning we are able to continue with the important work contained within it.\n\n\"I am delighted that we are now able to move forward again with this ambitious agenda, implementing the commitments we set out in this long-term strategy to transform disabled people's lives for the better.\"", "Many of the fatal accidents involve farm machinery\n\nAn average of more than five people every year died on Northern Ireland's farms in the past decade.\n\nNew figures from the Health and Safety Executive NI (HSENI) show 53 people were killed between January 2013 and December 2022.\n\nIt comes as the Farm Safety Foundation says the pace of change is \"far too slow\".\n\nThis week marks the 11th year of Farm Safety Week, which is organised by the foundation.\n\nStephanie Berkeley, manager of the Farm Safety Foundation, said the key message of Farm Safety Week 2023 was that farmers needed to value themselves.\n\n\"Everything is replaceable, you are not,\" she said.\n\nMs Berkeley added that the organisation was still having to roll out the campaign because farming continues to have the poorest safety record of any occupation in the UK and Ireland.\n\nShe said things were improving and that farmers knew they needed to take their safety seriously.\n\nThe HSENI said there had been two fatalities on farms in 2023.\n\nBoth victims were men over 60 and both incidents involved machinery.\n\nIn 2022, there were three deaths -

Patti Henry's cousin tells what the gift of a bench in her memory has meant to her family\n\nThe family of a murder victim whose body has never been found has revealed how a charity set up in memory of sales executive Moira Jones has helped them come to terms with their loss.\n\nPatricia Henry, 46, was killed by George Metcalff at her flat in Girvan, South Ayrshire, in November 2017.\n\nAfter his conviction her relatives contacted The Moira Fund for support.\n\nIt was launched after the murder of Miss Jones, 40, in Queen's Park, Glasgow on 29 May 2008.\n\nSince then the charity has helped more than 1,500 families cope with the violent loss of a loved one.\n\nMs Henry's relatives are among those who have benefitted from the fund and have since raised money for its work across the UK.\n\nAhead of the 15th anniversary of Moira's murder, Ms Henry's cousin Jacci McCarthy met up with Moira's mother Bea Jones for the first time to convey her gratitude.\n\nMs McCarthy told BBC Scotland: \"For our family it was restoring our faith in humanity.\n\n\"We have got a lady walking the road with us that knows what the family are going through, that has turned a personal tragedy into something so positive.\n\n\"Bea is an honorary part of our family now, whether she likes it or not.\"\n\nPatricia \"Patti\" Henry was last seen in November 2017\n\nIn November 2021 Ms Henry's killer was jailed for 22 years and four months.\n\nJudge Lord Armstrong told Metcalff, 72, that victim impact statements from relatives clearly indicated the \"devastating and continuing harm\" he had caused.\n\nThe following month the family approached The Moira Fund and were awarded a grant of \u00a31,200 for a memorial bench in Brodie Park, Paisley.\n\nIt has since become a poignant spot to remember Ms Henry, who grew up in the Renfrewshire town.\n\nJacci McCarthy (left) met Bea Jones in person for the first time in Brodie Park, Paisley\n\nMs McCarthy said: \"We got justice and everything for Patti. There is a man serving life for it.\n\n\"But we don't have Patti. We've never found Patti. Patti's murderer has never revealed where her body is.\n\n\"Through talking we thought a memorial bench would be nice because we don't have a grave for Patti.\"\n\nA memorial bench to Patti was installed in Brodie Park, Paisley\n\nThe bench has now become a focal point for the family and a place where they gather with flowers and sweets on Ms Henry's birthday and anniversary.\n\nMs McCarthy said: \"It is a park that is local to where we all grew up, to where Patti grew up.\n\n\"Patti learned to go her bike here when she was a wee girl, right here, with the stabilisers off.\"\n\nMs McCarthy described Bea as \"inspirational\" and said the family were keen to repay the charity for its help.\n\nIn February they organised a fundraising gig in the town's Bungalow bar which raised more than \u00a33,000.\n\nMs Jones said she was grateful for the money which would benefit a number of families.\n\nShe added: \"We have people that we have helped who want to help us back in different ways.\n\n\"Everybody can't do it. Of course not. Some of them are in dire straits.\n\n\"But when people can do something like that it's wonderful.\"\n\nSales executive Moira, who was 40 when she was murdered in May 2008, and her mother Bea\n\nIn April 2009 Moira's family announced they would launch a charity outside the High Court in Glasgow after her killer Marek Harcar was jailed for life.\n\nThe Slovakian national abducted the sales executive as she returned to her flat.\n\nMoira, who had lived in Glasgow for five years, was then forced into Queen's Park where she was raped and killed.\n\nEx-soldier Harcar was later ordered to spend a minimum of 25 years behind bars.\n\nIn the months that followed the murder Ms Jones, husband Hu and son Grant set up the Moira Fund to help people bereaved through violence.\n\nSince then it has helped hundreds of families across the UK by providing grants to cover everything from funeral costs to clothes for attending court.\n\nA stone marks the spot in Queen's Park where Moira's body was discovered on 29 May 2008\n\nIn 2020 Ms Jones shared her harrowing diaries with BBC Scotland to coincide with a documentary, The Dark Shadow of Murder.\n\nThe former teacher, who lives in Weston, Staffordshire, now draws comfort from the positive impact the charity has had on so many lives.\n\nShe said: \"It helps that someone has listened to what they are trying to say and understood.\n\n\"It helps to feel less alone.\"\n\nMoira's Run was first held in Queen's Park in 2014 and returned last year for the first time since two viral events were held during the pandemic\n\nThe fund's events include the annual 5k Moira Run which draws participants from clubs across the city and a team from Victim Support Scotland's Support for Families Bereaved by Crime (SFBC).\n\nAs well as her charity work Ms Jones' campaigning led to the launch of a Scottish Homicide Service, which provides murder victims' families with a dedicated case worker.\n\nAsked how she feels about the impact The Moira Fund has had, Ms Jones said: \"It means a lot.\n\n\"It's when the thank yous come in and you know the difference you have made.\n\nLooking to the future, Ms Jones added: \"I want this to go on when I have gone.\n\n\"I want it to go on so that there is more understanding, there is continued help, for people in the worst place they could be.\"\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "Turkish voters are faced with a momentous choice which will affect their country's political and economic future\n\nTurks are at a historic turning point - whether to keep their leader of more than 20 years or change to a more pro-Western path and roll back some of his sweeping presidential powers.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan is favourite to win Sunday's run-off vote, and promises a strong, multilateral Turkey. He says opposition claims of a dictatorship are smear campaigns and pure nonsense.\n\nHis chief rival, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, backed by a broad opposition, has billed the vote as a referendum on the future direction of Turkey and has sought the support of nationalist voters to increase his chance of victory.\n\nSince 2017, Mr Erdogan has run Turkey with extensive presidential power, from a vast palace in Ankara. As executive president he can declare a state of emergency and can pick or dismiss civil servants.\n\nHe accuses his opponents of being \"pro-LGBT\", while his Islamist-rooted party positions itself as on the side of the family and highlights its success in modernising Turkey.\n\nIf he wins on Sunday, not much will change, says Selim Koru, a member of Turkey's Tepav think tank. His powers are already so broad he won't seek to extend them further, he says.\n\nBut Alp Yenen, lecturer in Turkish studies at Leiden University, believes if Turkey's rampant inflation of more than 43% endures, the president's AK Party could accelerate what has been \"a slow pace of authoritarianism\".\n\nThe man seeking to replace Mr Erdogan wants to scrap the presidential system brought in five years ago and return to a parliament and prime minister in charge. Independent courts and a free press would follow.\n\nPresident Erdogan acquired sweeping executive powers in the aftermath of the botched coup against him in 2016\n\nThe president would become apolitical and the other five parties in the Kilicdaroglu alliance would each have a vice president, along with the two centre-left mayors of Ankara and Istanbul.\n\nBut Mr Erdogan's party and its nationalist and conservative allies have secured a majority in parliament and if the opposition alliance were to win the presidency they might struggle to push through their reforms.\n\nTurkey is part of the West's Nato defensive alliance, but the Erdogan presidency has sought close ties with China and Russia too, buying a Russian S-400 air defence system and inaugurating a Russian-built nuclear plant - Turkey's first - ahead of the election.\n\nHe advocates a multilateral stance, viewing Turkey as \"an island of peace and security\", and offering Ankara as a mediator in the Russian war in Ukraine.\n\nHis opponent and his allies, meanwhile, want to return to the process of joining the European Union and restore Turkey's military ties with the US, while maintaining relations with Russia.\n\nIf Mr Erdogan stays in power then Selim Koru believes he will continue to push Turkey away from the West, without leaving Nato. \"He wants to get Turkey to a point in the medium term or distant future where Nato membership is irrelevant.\"\n\nThis election is being watched very carefully by 3.5 million Syrian refugees who have temporary protection in Turkey, because Kemal Kilicdaroglu wants to send them home fast.\n\nThat's a major worry for Syrians, who came here mainly in the first six years of the war until 2017.\n\nNot least because, after the opposition leader trailed in the first round, he made refugees and irregular migrants the number one issue of his campaign. He needs the vote of almost 2.8 million Turks who supported an ultranationalist candidate in the first round.\n\nHe has accused President Erdogan of bringing 10 million migrants into Turkey, and he is talking about Syrians, but Iranians, Afghans and Pakistanis too.\n\nMore than 80% of Turks want the Syrians to go home, and yet more than 700,000 Syrians are in Turkish schools and 880,000 Syrian babies have been born in Turkey since 2011.\n\n\"I cannot understand how they would leave this life and go back to Syria,\" says Prof Murat Erdogan, who conducts Syrians' Barometer, a regular field study on Syrians in Turkey.\n\nKemal Kilicdaroglu says he will negotiate the Syrians' return with Damascus, but as Syria insists on Turkey leaving its 30km (18-mile) buffer zone over the border, that runs the risk of Syria launching attacks on the zone and sparking a new wave of refugees.\n\nTurkey's government says more than half a million Syrian refugees have returned home, but the opposition wants more to leave\n\nThe opposition leader knows full well an agreement would take up to two years, and he would ask the United Nations to oversee it. But Murat Erdogan believes it could take a decade to implement.\n\nPresident Erdogan has sought to defuse the issue, by promising to speed up the voluntary repatriation of a million Syrians through an agreement with President Bashar al-Assad. The idea of Syrians returning voluntarily seems far-fetched but Turkish state media reported that work on building 5,000 flats in Syria had already begun.\n\nTurkey's Kurds make up as much as a fifth of the 85 million population and they have a big stake in this election.\n\nThe pro-Kurdish party, which attracted almost 9% of the parliamentary vote, publicly backed Kemal Kilicdaroglu for president and sees the vote as a historic moment to get rid of a \"one-man regime\".\n\nPresident Erdogan has accused him of surrendering to the \"blackmail\" and agenda of both the pro-Kurdish party and PKK militants, who are seen by Turkey and the West as terrorists.\n\nBut Kurdish voters are alarmed the opposition challenger has aligned himself with a far-right leader on fighting \"terrorism\", because that usually refers to Kurdish militants.\n\nMr Kilicdaroglu has also agreed that Kurdish mayors can be replaced by trustees appointed by Ankara in so-called \"terror\" cases.\n\nThe pro-Kurdish party's co-chair Pervin Buldan has fully backed the opposition leader, but that does not mean all Kurdish voters will follow suit.\n\n\"Getting the nationalist vote is a possibility but there's a risk in losing the Kurdish vote - it's a delicate balance - how do you get them without losing Kurds?\" asks Alp Yenen.\n\nAhead of the first round it was the state of Turkey's economy that was foremost in voters' minds, before the refugee issue came to the fore.\n\nInflation is officially 43.68%, and Turks have had a cost of living crisis far more severe than most. Many will tell you the real inflation rate feels far higher.\n\nThe early Erdogan years were a byword for strong economic growth and enormous construction projects. And Turkey always stuck closely to the terms of its loan agreements with the IMF.\n\nBut in recent years his government has abandoned orthodox economic policy. It gradually eroded the independence of the central bank, sacking three of its governors in quick succession, says Selva Demiralp, professor of economics at Koc University.\n\nInflation soared, as interest rates were kept low - while Turkey's currency the lira depreciated to improve the trade balance and boost exports.\n\nOfficial inflation rates have fallen to 44% but Turks say the real inflation rate in shops and markets feels higher\n\nMr Erdogan still promises high growth, six million new jobs and a big push for tourism, but Prof Demiralp believes his policies will keep inflation as high as 45% for months to come.\n\nIf Kemal Kilicdaroglu and his allies win the presidency and parliament, she believes a return to orthodox economic policies and an independent central bank will lower inflation to 30% by the end of 2023 and it will continue to go down after that.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. The impact of the 7.4 magnitude earthquake in Taiwan\n\nRescuers in Taiwan are working to reach more than 600 stranded people, a day after the island experienced its worst earthquake in 25 years.\n\nOne survivor has recounted how tremors unleashed rockslides \"like bullets\" around the coal mine he was working at.\n\nThe 7.4 magnitude earthquake hit near the eastern county of Hualien, killing nine and injuring more than 1,000.\n\nSome stuck in tunnels and near a national park have been rescued by helicopters, but 34 are still missing.\n\nThe official number of people trapped or stranded rose considerably - from about 100 to 660 - on Thursday as people started getting phone signal back in the mountainous regions.\n\nAlmost all are guests and staff of a remote hotel who cannot leave because of damaged roads. Officials are now trying to work out the best way to get them out.\n\nFood supplies have been air-dropped to dozens trapped in these areas, local reports say.\n\n\"The mountain started raining rocks like bullets, we had nowhere to escape to, everyone ran beside the sandbags for cover,\" the survivor, identified by his surname Chu, told Taiwan's Central News Agency.\n\nThree of the nine who died were hikers on a trail leading towards Taroko National Park, named after a landmark gorge, just outside Hualien.\n\nIn Hualien city, the capital of the county where the earthquake struck, relief efforts are proceeding quickly, with workers using excavators and other heavy equipment to demolish several damaged buildings.\n\nOn Thursday morning, the BBC also witnessed relief workers removing huge boulders - the size of cars - that had fallen close to railway lines so as to get normal train services running again.\n\nThey are also using large amounts of gravel and rocks to shore up a 10-storey structure known as the Uranus building, which has been leaning downwards since the quake struck - to prevent it from falling over in case of another aftershock.\n\nLocal reports said one female teacher had died in the building when she returned to rescue her cat.\n\nThe red brick Uranus building is seen leaning precariously\n\nHsu Chiu-yueh, who was working opposite the Uranus building when it collapsed, told the BBC: \"It was so shaky I could barely walk. I was really scared. I felt my legs were not in control anymore. Thanks to my colleagues, they dragged me so we could get out.\"\n\n\"There was a lot of dust coming into our building on our way out... We [later] realised that it came from the building across the street that had partially collapsed,\" said the 50-year-old.\n\nAnother Hualien resident recounted how the quake threw her home into disarray.\n\n\"I was just getting out of bed when a clothes rack and a low cabinet fell over,\" Ocean Tsai told BBC Chinese.\n\n\"It kept getting stronger, and I started worrying about our belongings at home. Fortunately, apart from the motorcycle tipping over, the damage was minimal.\"\n\nThe earthquake, which struck 18km (11mi) south of Hualien, was followed by more than 200 aftershocks, dozens of which were at least 6.5 magnitude or more, hindering search and rescue efforts. Taiwanese authorities expect there to be more aftershocks in the next few days.\n\nPictures show how the road outside Hualien's Qingshui tunnel - one of many winding roads that run along Hualien's rocky coastline - had simply fallen away.\n\nRoutes like Qingshui are popular among tourists because of their spectacular views from the mountains out across the Pacific Ocean. But they are also known to be treacherous, not least because of the possibility of landslides.\n\nFurther north, the capital Taipei was also shaken violently with footage showing damaged buildings and people being evacuated. Local TV stations aired clips of smashed vehicles and stores in disarray.\n\n\"The earthquake is close to land and it's shallow. It's felt all over Taiwan and offshore islands... It's the strongest in 25 years,\" Wu Chien Fu, the director of Taipei's Seismology Centre said on Wednesday.\n\nPower cuts and internet outages were reported across the island.\n\nThe earthquake also triggered tsunami alerts earlier in the day on Wednesday in nearby Japanese and Philippine islands, but these alerts were later downgraded.\n\nWhile Taiwan has a history of quakes, both locals and foreigners who have lived in Taipei for years say this is the strongest quake they have experienced in decades.\n\nThe last major quake at 7.6 magnitude hit in September 1999, killing 2,400 people and destroying 5,000 buildings.\n\nAdditional reporting by Fan Wang in Singapore and BBC Chinese's Tzu-Wei Liu in Taipei", "First LV= Insurance Ashes Test, Edgbaston (day five of five)\n\nAustralia somehow prevailed in one of the all-time great Ashes Tests to beat England by two wickets and take a 1-0 lead in the series.\n\nOn an unbearably tense final day of another Edgbaston classic, ninth-wicket pair Pat Cummins and Nathan Lyon added an unbroken 55 to defy the raucous crowd and get Australia to their target of 281.\n\nIn doing so, they exacted revenge for Australia's famous two-run defeat on this ground 18 years ago, when the tailenders just fell short of reaching a target of 282.\n\nCummins, with 44 not out, and Lyon's unbeaten 16 took Australia to their narrowest Ashes win in terms of wickets since 1907.\n\nEngland looked to be surging towards victory when captain Ben Stokes produced a magical slower ball to bowl Usman Khawaja for 65 and Joe Root held a stunning return catch off Alex Carey.\n\nBut as a breathless match entered its final hour, Cummins and Lyon swung the bat at England's short-ball plan to inch Australia closer.\n\nStokes almost dismissed Lyon with a flying catch for the ages when 37 were still needed, the skipper losing control of the ball as he dived backwards at square leg.\n\nThe target ticked down, the evening drew in. With three runs required and less than five overs remaining, Cummins deflected Ollie Robinson towards third man, a diving Harry Brook fumbled and Australia had an incredible victory.\n\nA series that has already lived up to the hype continues with the second Test at Lord's on 28 June.\n\u2022 None 'Cummins is The Boss but England can come back'\n\u2022 None Relive an incredible day with all the best clips\n\u2022 None Watch the highlights on Today at the Test\n\nThis was not just an homage to the epic contest on the same ground 18 years ago, but the perfect opening to the most anticipated Ashes series in a generation.\n\nFrom the moment Zak Crawley crunched the first ball of the series for four, this Test had everything: England's daring first-day declaration, Root's attempted reverse-ramp off Cummins from the first ball of day four and the fascinating clash of style between the two teams.\n\nBut none of that could match the nerve-shredding drama of the final hour, played out in front of a buoyant crowd that had earlier waited until 14:15 BST for rain to pass and play to begin.\n\nEngland have been involved in some thrilling Tests since Stokes took charge, but none with the stakes as high as this. In truth, they wasted chances throughout, but have shown enough quality, endeavour and bravery to suggest they have what it takes to get back into the series.\n\nFor Australia, the narrow win just about vindicates their cautious approach to combatting England's Bazballers. It was fitting that captain Cummins, the architect of the safety-first plan, played the vital role on the final day.\n\nThis was magnificent sporting theatre, whetting the appetite for the rest of the series and for the Test between England and Australia's women, which begins at Trent Bridge on Thursday.\n\nCummins and Lyon get revenge 18 years in the making\n\nIn 2005, Australia arrived on the fourth morning needing 107 with only two wickets remaining and almost got them thanks to the efforts of their last three batters - Shane Warne, Brett Lee and Michael Kasprowicz.\n\nFrom a position almost as hopeless, Cummins and Lyon launched their own rescue mission and this time got Australia over the line.\n\nThe tourists had been almost inert for most of the day. At 107-3 overnight, they did not shift from a neutral gear. Khawaja, who made a century in the first innings, added only 31 runs from 116 balls and looked immovable.\n\nStokes somehow conjured the slower ball from his fragile body and Root held on to Carey to make England favourites, but fearsome competitors Cummins and Lyon refused to yield.\n\nRoot had already failed to cling on to a low caught-and-bowled chance when Cummins had six and the captain would later make him pay by crashing 14 from a single over.\n\nIn the next over, Stokes flung himself at a catch that would have matched his grab in the 2019 World Cup, but this time could not hold on.\n\nThe new ball was belatedly taken, but Australia's confidence grew. For every time the outside edge was beaten, a single was pinched. Cummins slapped Robinson past a flying Ollie Pope at cover, Lyon twice belted Stuart Broad down the ground for fours.\n\nThe outside edge was beaten, England kept the field back, James Anderson was ignored. Australia were within one hit of victory for more than two overs.\n\nWith three required, Cummins fended off a short ball and the flailing Brook could not prevent the boundary. Australia ended on 282 - their target back in 2005 - and the brilliant Cummins threw his bat in the air to begin wild celebrations.\n\nEngland had lost two of their past 12 Tests and one of those, against New Zealand in Wellington in February, was by just one run after they had made the Black Caps follow on.\n\nThis, though, will test the resolve of their new attitude under captain Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum like never before. Not because their swashbuckling style has failed its first examination by Australia, but because they were so close to winning and it is their own errors that have cost them.\n\nThey missed eight chances of varying difficulty in the field, four of which were by wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow. Most crucially, Bairstow failed to move for an edge when Khawaja had only five on the fourth evening.\n\nQuestions will linger over Stokes' decision to declare on the first evening and the fitness of Moeen Ali, who was badly hampered by a cut on his spinning finger throughout the match.\n\nIt was also telling that Stokes, who is managing a left-knee injury, did not bowl himself until the 70th over of the second innings and that Anderson, England's all-time leading wicket-taker, was not trusted with the second new ball.\n\nNo team has come from behind to win an Ashes series since 2005. Stokes' England have shown they can get at Australia, but they must be near-perfect in the remaining four Tests if they are to win the urn for the first time since 2015.\n\u2022 None How did Messi win the World Cup with Argentina?

It's clear that he's still deeply shaken. Two of his friends were killed in the attack.\n\nHe tells us he spent Thursday night with survivors in hospital, and at the police station. But he also comforted relatives as they waited in a hastily arranged emergency centre for news of their loved ones.\n\n\"It's hard to imagine - a group of people are sitting together during an evening in the church, reading the Bible, singing, praying together. Then they spend a couple of minutes together to talk to each other after the meeting, Then, all of a sudden, a scene of love becomes a scene of hate and death.\"\n\nThe fact that the killer was a former member of the Jehovah's Witness community here makes the tragedy particularly hard to bear.\n\nThere are about 4,000 Jehovah's Witnesses in and around Hamburg. The community is divided into smaller congregations, each with their own meeting place, known as a Kingdom Hall.\n\nDetectives investigating the mass shooting have said the killer left the Jehovah's Witnesses on terms which were \"not good\".\n\nMr Tsifidaris says he doesn't know why the man left, didn't know him personally, and appears reluctant to talk about him.\n\nThose who leave the Jehovah's Witnesses are often \"disassociated\" or cut off by most members of the community; a practice sometimes referred to as \"shunning\".\n\nThe police have revealed they recently received an anonymous letter, in which the author warned the attacker had a gun, was mentally unstable and harboured anger against religious groups, including the Jehovah's Witnesses.\n\n\"He left the community two years ago and now, all of a sudden, he's showing up and is acting against all the principles we stand for,\" says Mr Tsifidaris.\n\n\"What we know is that in the religious context, there is a community he knows, there is a community he was part of, so this is a community he focused his hate on. He knew the premises, he knew the arrangements.\"\n\nFor now, the community is meeting online. Mr Tsifidaris, who refers to his fellow members as brothers and sisters, speaks often of the comfort to be found in supporting one another. \"We pray together, we cry together.\"\n\nUppermost in their thoughts are those who remain seriously injured in hospital. He's adamant that their treatment is not compromised by a refusal to accept blood transfusions - Jehovah's Witnesses believe that God forbids this.\n\nThey are not yet out of danger, he tells us, but the doctors say there's a fair chance most will survive.\n\nFor now, the focus is on supporting the bereaved and the traumatised. No one, he says, is left alone in their grief.\n\nThis attack has left a city in mourning and a community in shock and horror. It will, says Mr Tsifidaris, take years to heal.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses services were cancelled after the mass shooting", "Last updated on .From the section Cricket\n\nEngland and Australia will pay tribute to the victims of the Nottingham attacks on day one of the first Ashes Test at Edgbaston on Friday.\n\nPlayers and management will wear black armbands, while there will also be a moment's silence before play starts.\n\nThe same tributes will be paid on day one of the women's Ashes Test at Trent Bridge in Nottingham on 22 June.\n\nThree people died after a series of attacks in Nottingham early on Tuesday morning.\n\nUniversity of Nottingham students Barnaby Webber and Grace O'Malley-Kumar, both 19, and school caretaker Ian Coates, 65, were stabbed, with another three people injured.\n\n\"The deeply distressing scenes witnessed in Nottingham this week have brought immense sorrow to everyone, particularly the cherished friends and families of the victims,\" said England men's Test captain Ben Stokes.\n\n\"It is impossible to express how much their lives and futures have been tragically disrupted.\n\n\"These events sadden the England cricket teams, and we are thinking about those affected at this harrowing time.

We had bills to pay.\"\n\nThe only way for the DWP to recover the money was to prosecute Mrs Groom, so she was charged with benefit fraud offences.\n\nWithout legal representation to assist her, Mrs Groom pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a community order with unpaid work requirements.\n\nShe was, however, forced back to court after the DWP initiated proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act (POCA), enabling them to ask a judge to order the confiscation of her inheritance.\n\nThat order was granted on Wednesday, despite a different judge describing himself as \"truly unimpressed\" with the DWP's handling of the case during her sentencing hearing.\n\nAt that earlier hearing, the Recorder of Chester, judge Steven Everett, told Mrs Groom she was \"doing the best you could for your mother\".\n\nSpeaking outside court on Wednesday, her husband, Geoff, told the BBC his wife had been \"penalised for looking after her mum\".\n\nThe DWP has faced criticism for failing to prevent overpayments, despite having the ability to do so, and allowing the recipients to end up in legal trouble.\n\nBenefit staff get automatic alerts from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) if a carer's allowance claimant is earning too much to claim.\n\nOne DWP employee agreed to speak about Mrs Groom's case on condition of anonymity.\n\n\"From 2014 onwards really they had no excuse for having these overpayments carry on for longer than two or three months \u2026 if they're investigating all of the alerts\", he told BBC North West Tonight.\n\n\"DWP should be protecting these people from getting into trouble with their benefits but instead they're persecuting them and treating them like hardened criminals using the Proceeds of Crime Act against them. It's appalling.\"\n\nFive years ago a report from the House of Commons Work and Pensions Committee accused the DWP of \"bullying and harassing\" those who had been overpaid.\n\nMargaret Greenwood, Labour MP for Wirral West, told the BBC about 44% of people caring for others for more than 35 hours a week are \"living in poverty\".\n\nShe said to then receive a \"large bill\" for overpayments they are often unaware of \"can be devastating for people\".\n\nLast year the DWP revealed it was seeking to recover 145,567 overpayments of Carers Allowance.\n\nAn extra 26,500 overpayments were added to that total in the last year alone.\n\nA spokesperson for the DWP said: \"We are committed to fairness in the welfare system while protecting the public purse.\n\n\"Claimants have a responsibility to inform DWP of any changes in their circumstances that could impact their award, and it is right that we recover taxpayers' money when this has not occurred.\"\n\nWhy not follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X and Instagram?

I told him this.\"\n\nEidevall said he did not feel \"comfortable with the label\".\n\nThe Swede said the situation with Cuthbert arose because the teams had disagreed about whether there should be a multi-ball system when the ball went out.\n\nEidevall was booked for his goal celebration but Hayes later said she believed he should have been dismissed for his conduct.", "Lucy Letby, 33, is accused of murdering babies on a neonatal ward\n\nOne of nurse Lucy Letby's \"favourite ways of killing and trying to kill children\" on a hospital neonatal unit was by injecting air, a prosecutor has told her trial.\n\nMs Letby is alleged to have murdered seven babies and attempted to murder 10 others between June 2015 and June 2016.\n\nProsecutor Nick Johnson KC said experts for the prosecution had told Manchester Crown Court at least 12 of those received an air injection.\n\nOn the third day of his closing speech, Mr Johnson told jurors not to ignore the \"constellation of coincidences\" in baby deaths at the Countess of Chester Hospital.\n\nHe said they should \"put all the pieces of the jigsaw together\" and suggested the \"cumulative picture\" told only one story, that Ms Letby \"tried to murder or murdered these children\".\n\nMr Johnson cited the case of Child C, who stopped breathing without warning on 13 June 2015 while being treated in the unit's nursery one.\n\nHe said the collapse and death was \"inconsistent\" with all natural causes, as asserted by the medical experts in the case.\n\nThe prosecutor noted the nurse was seen in nursery one at the time of Child C's collapse, despite being allocated a baby in nursery three.\n\nHe said she was there \"with death on her mind\".\n\nMr Johnson went on to remind the jury of Sophie Ellis' evidence, who was Child C's designated nurse that day.\n\nMs Ellis told the jury how she had briefly left Child C and when she returned to the nursery, Ms Letby was standing over him.\n\nShe said the nurse told her: \"He's just had a brady/desat\".\n\nThe alleged attacks were said to have been carried out at Countess of Chester Hospital\n\nMr Johnson also said nurse Melanie Taylor had recalled being surprised at how \"cool and calm\" Ms Letby appeared as medics rushed to help the baby.\n\nHe alleged that swelling noted by a doctor in Child C's vocal cords indicated that \"something had been put down his throat\".\n\nThis was also a feature in the cases of Child E, Child G, Child H and Child N, he said.\n\nMr Johnson went on to state that another clue the jurors should consider in Child C's case was the \"massive ballooning\" to his stomach.\n\n\"It's as plain as the nose on your face that Lucy Letby must have injected air down the nasogastric tube,\" he said.\n\n\"It was, after all, one of her favourite ways of killing or trying to kill children in this case.\n\n\"There are a constellation of coincidences which can make you sure that [Child C] didn't die of natural causes and that Lucy Letby killed him.\"\n\nThe nurse, originally from Hereford, has denied all of the charges against her\n\nMr Johnson also noted how Ms Letby's defence counsel, Ben Myers KC, had repeatedly questioned witnesses about the competence of Ms Ellis, who Ms Letby had called the \"new girl\" in messages to colleagues.\n\nThe prosecutor said it was insinuated Ms Ellis was not qualified to be looking after Child C.\n\n\"It's trying to create in the impression in your minds that something was seriously wrong with the hospital,\" he said, adding: \"It's gaslighting you, doing to you what Lucy Letby did to her colleagues.\"\n\nMr Johnson later turned to the evidence heard about Child G, who was transferred to the Countess of Chester Hospital from Wirral's Arrowe Park Hospital in mid-August 2015.\n\nThe court has heard she was \"clinically stable\" until 7 September, when she projectile vomited at about 02:00 BST.\n\nThe prosecution case has been that Ms Letby overfed Child G with milk through a nasogastric tube or injected air into the same tube and made two more attempts to kill her on 21 September.\n\nMr Johnson pointed the jury to what Dr Alison Ventress said about Child G.\n\nThe medic told the jury she saw blood-stained secretions coming from the vocal cords in the early hours of 7 September 2015.\n\n\"What caused the throat of an otherwise well baby to bleed?\" Mr Johnson asked.\n\n\"It is a signature of many of her attacks on these babies.\"\n\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

And that is why this week's European Parliament debate on how the technology is regulated is so important. But how could AI be made safe? Here are five of the challenges ahead.\n\nThe European Parliament has taken two years to come up with a definition of an AI system - software that can \"for a given set of human-defined objectives, generate outputs such as content, predictions, recommendations or decisions influencing the environments they interact with\".\n\nThis week, it is voting on its Artificial Intelligence Act - the first legal rules of their kind on AI, which go beyond voluntary codes and require companies to comply.\n\nFormer UK Office for Artificial Intelligence head Sana Kharaghani points out the technology has no respect for borders.\n\n\"We do need to have international collaboration on this - I know it will be hard,\" she tells BBC News. \"This is not a domestic matter.

It is already:\n\nBut what about screening job applicants or predicting how likely someone is to commit crime?\n\nThe European Parliament wants the public informed about the risks attached to each AI product.\n\nCompanies that break its rules could be fined the greater of \u20ac30m or 6% of global annual turnover.\n\nBut can developers predict or control how their product might be used?\n\nSo far, AI has been largely self-policed.\n\nThe big companies say they are on board with government regulation - \"critical\" to mitigate the potential risks, according to Sam Altman, boss of ChatGPT creator OpenAI.\n\nBut will they put profits before people if they become too involved in writing the rules?\n\nYou can bet they want to be as close as possible to the lawmakers tasked with setting out the regulations.\n\nAnd Lastminute.com founder Baroness Lane-Fox says it is important to listen not just to corporations.\n\n\"We must involve civil society, academia, people who are affected by these different models and transformations,\" she says.\n\nMicrosoft, which has invested billions of dollars in ChatGPT, wants it to \"take the drudgery out of work\".\n\nIt can generate human-like prose and text responses but, Mr Altman points out, is \"a tool, not a creature\".\n\nChatbots are supposed to make workers more productive.\n\nAnd in some industries, AI has the capacity to create jobs and be a formidable assistant.\n\nBut others have already lost them - last month, BT announced AI would replace 10,000 jobs.\n\nChatGPT came into public use just over six months ago.\n\nNow, it can write essays, plan people's holidays and pass professional exams.\n\nThe capability of these large-scale language models is growing at a phenomenal rate.\n\nAnd two of the three AI \"godfathers\" - Geoffrey Hinton and Prof Yoshua Bengio - have been among those to warn the technology has huge potential for harm.\n\nThe Artificial Intelligence Act will not come into force until at least 2025 - \"way too late\", EU technology chief Margrethe Vestager says.\n\nShe is drawing up an interim voluntary code for the sector, alongside the US, which could be ready within weeks.", "The rain warning is in place until 10:00 GMT on Thursday\n\nDisruptive rain is forecast for Northern Ireland from this afternoon with a weather warning issued by the Met Office.\n\nTravel disruption is expected as the rain becomes more persistent later on Wednesday.\n\nIt is due to last until later on Thursday morning, with between 20mm to 30mm of rain expected quite widely.\n\nSome areas could see up to 40mm of rainfall accumulating during that period.\n\nThat is likely to lead to surface spray and flooding on roads before conditions improve from the west on Thursday.\n\nThe warning is in place from 14:00 GMT on Wednesday until 10:00 GMT on Thursday.\n\nIt comes after heavy snowfall last week caused major delays and disruptions across the country.\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

It triggered an unprecedented wave of walkouts from fellow pundits and commentators in solidarity with Lineker, which disrupted weekend football coverage across the BBC.\n\nSports presenter Mark Chapman - who did not present BBC Radio 5 Live's Saturday Coverage or Match of the Day 2 on Sunday on TV - returned to football radio show The Monday Night Club and apologised for the lack of service over the weekend.\n\nHe said it had been \"miserable and difficult\" for the staff involved and it was \"disgusting and unfair\" that the staff who did work on the weekend received abuse.\n\nHe added: \"It is ironic in a row over impartiality we have all been seen to be taking sides, and I feel there are lessons to be learned by all involved.\"\n\nBBC Scotland also had full coverage of Monday evening's Scottish cup tie between Falkirk and Ayr United after its programming was also limited over the weekend.\n\nAfter his return to BBC TV was announced, Lineker tweeted: \"However difficult the last few days have been, it simply doesn't compare to having to flee your home from persecution or war to seek refuge in a land far away.\n\n\"It's heartwarming to have seen the empathy towards their plight from so many of you. We remain a country of predominantly tolerant, welcoming and generous people.\"\n\nThe government's Illegal Migration Bill passed its first hurdle in the Commons by 312 votes to 250 on Monday night, with the majority of Tory MPs voting for the plans.\n\nLineker has hosted Match of the Day since 1999 and is the BBC's highest paid star, having earned about \u00a31.35m in 2020-21. He is employed by the BBC on a freelance basis.\n\nBBC employees are expected to remain impartial on political matters and must follow strict social media guidelines, but there is significant debate about how they should apply to staff outside of news.\n\nLineker said he backed the independent social media review which Davie said will have a \"particular focus\" on how the guidelines apply to freelancers outside news and current affairs.\n\n\"Shortly, the BBC will announce who will conduct that review,\" Davie said. \"Between now and when the review reports Gary will abide by the editorial guidelines, that's where we are.\"\n\nLineker is expected to return to host Match of the Day's live coverage of the FA Cup quarter-final between Manchester City and Burnley on Saturday evening.\n\nHe is then set to front Sunday's live coverage of Grimsby Town at Brighton & Hove Albion on BBC One.\n\nThe row over Lineker's tweets also renewed questions over BBC chairman Richard Sharp. A review into Mr Sharp's appointment as BBC chairman is investigating whether he failed to properly disclose details of his involvement in the facilitation of an \u00a3800,000 loan guarantee for the then-prime minister Boris Johnson. He has denied any involvement in the arrangement of a loan for Mr Johnson.\n\nAsked about Mr Sharp, Mr Sunak told the BBC: \"He was appointed before I was prime minister through an independent process. And that process is also now being reviewed independently. It's right that we let that review complete.\"\n\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey tweeted: \"The BBC has made the right decision on Gary Lineker - now it's time for Rishi Sunak to do the right thing and sack Richard Sharp. The BBC needs a proper independent chair not a Johnson acolyte.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.", "Stockton Rush III was born in California in 1962 into a family that made its fortune from oil and shipping.\n\nStockton Rush wanted to be known as an innovator. It didn't seem to matter how he did it.\n\nBright, driven, born into wealth, his dream was to be the first person to reach Mars.\n\nWhen he realised that was unlikely to happen in his lifetime, he turned his attentions to the sea.\n\n\"I wanted to be Captain Kirk and in our lifetime, the final frontier is the ocean,\" he told a journalist in 2017.\n\nThe ocean promised adventure, adrenaline and mystery. He also believed it promised profits - if he could make a success of the submersible he helped design, which he directed his company OceanGate to build.\n\nHe had a maverick spirit that seemed to draw people in, earning him the admiration of his employees, passengers and investors.\n\n\"His passion was amazing and I bought into it,\" said Aaron Newman, who travelled on Mr Rush's Titan sub and eventually became an OceanGate investor.\n\nBut Mr Rush's soaring ambition also drew scrutiny from industry experts who warned he was cutting corners, putting innovation ahead of safety and risking potentially catastrophic results.\n\nIt wasn't something he was willing to accept.\n\nLast week, he and four other people on board the Titan lost their lives when it imploded.\n\n\"You're remembered for the rules you break,\" Mr Rush once said, quoting US general Douglas MacArthur.\n\n\"I've broken some rules,\" he said about the Titan. \"I think I've broken them with logic and good engineering behind me.\"\n\nStockton Rush III was born in California in 1962 into a family that made its fortune from oil and shipping.\n\nHe was sent to a prestigious boarding school, the Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire, and went on to earn a bachelor's degree in aerospace engineering from Princeton University in 1984.\n\nAt 19, he became the youngest pilot in the world to qualify for jet transport rating, the highest pilot rating obtainable. He worked on F-15s and anti-satellite missile programmes, with the hope of eventually joining the US space programme and being an astronaut.\n\nBut eventually that ambition lost its appeal, as a trip to the Red Planet seemed increasingly out of reach.\n\n\"If someone would tell me what the commercial or military reason to go to Mars is, I would believe it's going to happen,\" Mr Rush told Fast Company magazine. \"It's just a dream.\"\n\nSo he shifted his gaze downward and in 2009 founded OceanGate, a private company that offered customers - Mr Rush preferred the term \"adventurers\" - a chance to experience deep sea travel, including to the wreck of the Titanic.\n\nJessica Parker explores how the search for the Titan submersible unfolded and its devastating outcome.\n\nThe company, based in Everett in Washington state, was small and tight-knit. Rush would chair all-staff meetings at its headquarters, while his wife Wendy - another member of Princeton's class of 1984 - was his director of communications.\n\nA junior employee who worked at OceanGate from 2017 to 2018, and asked not to be identified, said the company headquarters felt homey and lived-in, with wiring and equipment seemingly everywhere. \"It was very free-flowing.\"\n\n\"He was just really passionate about what he was doing and very good at instilling that passion into everybody else that worked there,\" the employee told the BBC.\n\nAt one staff meeting, Mr Rush brought virtual reality goggles for everyone to take a digital underwater tour. Mr Rush told them that this is what they were aiming for - to allow more people to have this view. \"This is the world I want,\" he told them.\n\nMr Rush was \"not a leader from the back, telling people what to do - he led from the front\", said Mr Newman, the investor.\n\nMr Newman went on the Titan with Mr Rush to see the wreck of the Titanic in the summer of 2021.\n\nThe first time they met, Mr Rush \"spent hours\" talking with him about the potential of exploring the bottom of the ocean.\n\nMr Rush \"followed his own path\", Mr Newman said.\n\nMr Newman's recollection of OceanGate was of a team that looked out for each other.\n\nAnd Mr Rush's wife, Wendy, was \"up at the top, looking over his shoulder, making sure that he was doing everything perfectly and not cutting corners or skipping things\", he said.\n\nMr Newman was so taken by Mr Rush that he decided to invest in OceanGate. \"You know, I didn't know if I'd ever see any return or not. That was not the point,\" he said.\n\n\"The point was to be part of something that's experimental and is breaking new ground, and pushing forward our technology, and how the world works, and going places and doing amazing things, that's what this is about.\"\n\nMr Newman described himself as a minor investor. As a private company, OceanGate is not obliged to publish all financial records. US financial records from January 2020 show that Mr Rush and his fellow directors sold a stake in the company worth $18m, thought to have been used to fund the development of Titan.\n\nTo recoup the costs, OceanGate's sub, \"well-lit and comfortable,\" the company said, came with a price tag of $250,000 (\u00a3195,600) for an underwater trip.\n\nMr Rush's clients were uber-rich thrill seekers, willing to part with that sum for a once-in-a-lifetime adventure.\n\nLas Vegas businessman Jay Bloom had been messaging Mr Rush about joining a dive, before finally turning down a seat for himself and his son on the fatal excursion.\n\nHe said the chance to see the wreck up close would have been a \"bucket-list\" experience. It was about being able to say \"you did something very few people have the opportunity to do\", he said.\n\nDespite the large sums of money involved, OceanGate equipment sometimes had a home-made feel.\n\nThe former junior employee told the BBC he was surprised to find that Titan's electrical design included off-the-shelf development boards, as opposed to using a custom, in-house design like other engineering companies.\n\nDavid Pogue, a CBS News journalist who joined Mr Rush on a trip to the Titanic wreck in 2021, said the chief executive drove the Titan with a game controller and used \"rusty lead pipes from the construction industry as ballast\".\n\nYet Mr Rush assured Mr Pogue that only thing that really mattered was the vessel's hull, built from an unusual and largely untested material for a deep sea vessel: carbon fibre, with titanium end plates.\n\nMr Rush knew carbon fibre was used successfully in yachts and aviation, and believed it would allow for his submersible to made more cheaply than industry-standard steels ones.\n\n\"There's a rule you don't do that,\" said Mr Rush in 2021. \"Well, I did.\"\n\nThe tube shape of the Titan was also unusual. The hull of a deep-diving sub is usually spherical, which means it receives an equal amount of pressure at every point, but the Titan had a cylinder-shaped cabin. OceanGate gave it sensors to analyse the effects of changing pressure as it descended.\n\nThe glass viewport, from which passengers could see out, was only certified down to 1,300m, far short of the depths of the ocean floor where the Titantic wreck lay.\n\nRob McCallum, an explorer who acted as a consultant for OceanGate, became concerned when Mr Rush decided against getting official certification for the submersible.\n\nSubs can be certified or \"classed\" by marine organisations, like the American Bureau of Shipping or Lloyd's Register, meaning the vehicle must meet certain standards on things like stability, strength, safety and performance. But this process is not mandatory.\n\nIn emails to Mr Rush in March 2018, seen by BBC News, Mr McCallum said: \"You are wanting to use a prototype un-classed technology in a very hostile place. As much as I appreciate entrepreneurship and innovation, you are potentially putting an entire industry at risk.\n\n\"4,000m down in the mid-Atlantic is not the kind of place you can cut corners.\"\n\nMr Rush, apparently indignant, responded that he was \"tired of industry players who try to use a safety argument to stop innovation\".\n\nSafety was \"about culture, not paperwork\", he said. He talked of needing \"sensible design, extensive testing, and informed consent of the participants\", but said a piece of paper did not guarantee the safety of a sub.\n\nWhile he admitted deviating from some guidelines, such as \"overly conservative\" viewport limits, he argued the Titan's safety systems were \"way beyond\" anything else in use.\n\nHe wrote: \"I know that our engineering focused, innovative approach (as opposed to an existing standards compliance-focused design process) flies in the face of the submersible orthodoxy, but that is the nature of innovation.\"\n\nThe tense exchange ended after OceanGate's lawyers threatened legal action, Mr McCallum said.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: OceanGate boss Stockton Rush on his passion for the seas - and for taking risks\n\nBut Mr McCallum was not the only person linked to the company to speak out about safety.\n\nJust a few months earlier, former OceanGate employee David Lochridge raised concerns in an inspection report which identified \"numerous issues that posed serious safety concerns\", including how the hull had been tested.\n\nAlso in 2018, the Marine Technology Society sent a letter to OceanGate accusing it of making misleading claims about its design exceeding established industry safety standards, and warned that OceanGate's \"experimental\" approach could result in \"negative outcomes (from minor to catastrophic)\".\n\nIn a blog post in 2019, Mr Rush insisted that the majority of marine accidents were down to operator error. He said OceanGate took safety requirements very seriously, but that keeping an outside body informed on every modification before it was tested in a real-word setting was \"anathema to rapid innovation\".\n\nThe former employee told the BBC that while he had worked at OceanGate, he had felt confident in Mr Rush's commitment to safety.\n\n\"Rush was very level-headed, he knew what needed to be done,\" he said. \"He went on every sub dive, he was the pilot for every single one, and that's because he trusted the safety of the sub.\"\n\nMr Newman told the BBC the sub might not have been certified, but it was tested extensively. Mr Rush \"introduced new ideas and new pieces that are not conventional, and some people don't like that\", he said.\n\n\"The idea that this is something that's unique and Stockton did something wrong is disingenuous,\" he said.\n\nMr Rush himself told CBS reporter Mr Pogue last year that \"if you just want to be safe, don't get out of bed\".\n\n\"Don't get in your car. Don't do anything. At some point, you're going to take some risk, and it really is a risk-reward question. I think I can do this just as safely by breaking the rules,\" he said.\n\nThe question is why despite other successful dives, the sub's final trip ended in tragedy, Mr Newman said.\n\n\"Clearly, the pressure hull gave way, right? And the question is, why would that give way?\"\n\nGuillermo S\u00f6hnlein, a co-founder of OceanGate and Rush's former business partner, said he would not have taken a different approach himself.\n\n\"The human submersible community globally is very small, and we all know each other, and I think generally we all respect each other's opinions.\n\n\"The bottom line is that everyone's got different opinions on how subs should be designed,\" said Mr S\u00f6hnlein.\n\nAfter his son also raised fears about the sub, Jay Bloom declined Mr Rush's invitation.\n\n\"I am sure he really believed what he was saying,\" Mr Bloom said. \"But he was very wrong.\"", "Deputy first minister John Swinney has revealed that he repeatedly tried to leave the Scottish government over the last seven years.\n\nMr Swinney told the BBC that Nicola Sturgeon \"wouldn't countenance\" his offers to make way in 2016 and 2021.\n\nHe also came \"incredibly close\" to resigning over the controversial system of exam moderation during the pandemic.\n\nMs Sturgeon said she had always done everything in her power to keep Mr Swinney in government.\n\nThe first minister described her long-serving deputy as \"the most important person in my adult life outside my husband and family\".\n\nThe pair will stand down together next week after 16 years in power, following the election of a new SNP leader.\n\nThey have been speaking to the Nicola Sturgeon podcast - a new series starting on BBC Sounds on Monday 27 March.\n\nThe first episode tells the inside story of the first minister's sudden resignation.\n\nMr Swinney said he became \"pretty certain\" Ms Sturgeon was set to leave about a week before her announcement.\n\nHowever, he had started to wonder about her thinking at Christmas, when he told the first minister he intended to leave government when his spell as acting finance secretary was over.\n\nMs Sturgeon apparently did not challenge his decision, as she had done on previous occasions.\n\nWhen Mr Swinney offered to stand down after the Scottish Parliament elections in 2016 and 2021 he said \"she basically wouldn't countenance me leaving government\".\n\nThat was confirmed by Ms Sturgeon, who said that whenever her deputy raised the possibility of leaving she had \"done everything in my power to talk him out of it\".\n\nAsked about what impact Mr Swinney's decision had on her, the first minister said she may already have been starting to wrestle with her own future.\n\n\"If you'd said to me then that come the middle of February you're going to be announcing your resignation, I would have said, don't be ridiculous,\" she said.\n\n\"But looking back on it, I think subconsciously I was already grappling with that, and maybe in my response to John there was a sense of what deep down inside maybe I knew was coming for me as well.\"\n\nMr Swinney felt he should resign during a row over exam grades during the Covid pandemic\n\nMs Sturgeon has relied heavily on Mr Swinney over her years in power and once again rejected his offer to resign during the 2020 exams debacle.\n\nAs education secretary, Mr Swinney approved a system of moderation that resulted in some pupils being downgraded based on the historic performance of their school.\n\nThe system was widely considered to be unfair to those from more deprived areas and was eventually scrapped with students receiving the grades their teachers recommended instead.\n\n\"I persuaded the first minister that was the right thing to do, and it turned out to be the wrong thing to do,\" he said.\n\n\"I came incredibly close to resigning. Very, very close because I felt I had made a mistake.\n\n\"l remember reading a comment which said surely the kids in Scotland could have been given a break, because everything else has been turned upside down. And I thought, that's your mistake mate, you should own it.\"\n\nMr Swinney said he \"took a bit of persuading\", but that Ms Sturgeon convinced him to stay in post to deliver changes to the system.\n\nHe later survived an opposition attempt to oust him in a vote of no confidence at Holyrood over the row.\n\nJohn Swinney and Nicola Sturgeon are both heading for the back benches\n\nMs Sturgeon defended him in that debate and has paid a warm tribute to him as they prepare to leave government. In a personal statement at Holyrood on Thursday, she described Swinney as \"the best deputy first minister and the best friend\" she could have had in office.\n\nSeparately, she told the BBC \"the most important person in my adult life outside my husband and family is actually John Swinney\".\n\nThe first minister said she realised that to be the case when they sat down together after she gave evidence to the Holyrood committee investigating the Scottish government's mishandling of complaints against the former first minister, Alex Salmond.\n\nIn the past, Ms Sturgeon had described Mr Salmond - her friend and mentor of 30 years - in similar terms.\n\nShe has revised that assessment after the spectacular breakdown in their relationship in 2018.\n\nYou can subscribe to the Nicola Sturgeon podcast on BBC Sounds now.

Harrowing video shows people holding on to aircon units as hospital burns\n\nTwelve people have been detained by police for questioning after a hospital fire in Beijing killed at least 29, most of them patients.\n\nThe fire, among the deadliest in recent years, broke out in Changfeng Hospital at about 13:00 local time on Tuesday.\n\nAngry and concerned relatives rushed to the hospital hours later, only learning of the fire from local news reports.\n\n\"Seven or eight hours have passed and I didn't even receive a call,\" one relative told China Youth Daily.\n\nMany said they spent the night trying to locate loved ones. Those who were rescued have now been shifted to other hospitals for treatment.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference on Wednesday, officials said a preliminary investigation showed that sparks generated during renovation works had ignited paint stored on site.\n\nAmong those detained are the director and deputy director of the hospital, as well as the head of the firm overseeing the renovation works.\n\nFootage on social media showed patients jumping out of windows to flee as dense smoke billowed out of the building. A talking drone urged trapped patients to \"stay calm and wait [to be] rescued\". Some were seen balancing on external air conditioning units as they waited to be rescued.\n\nLocal media reported that firefighters evacuated about 70 people and put out the flames within an hour of arriving.\n\nBut relatives of those who were being treated at Changfeng were furious with the hospital management.\n\nThey said even eight hours later, hospital officials were unable to provide the names of those who had been injured or had died.\n\n\"Just tell me if the patient is dead or alive,\" a relative told local media. \"How can the person just disappear out of thin air? Neither the nurses nor doctors picked up their phones. My elderly relative doesn't have a phone on him.\"\n\nReports suggest that most patients at the hospital were elderly, and some had undergone amputation surgeries, which made them less mobile.\n\nChinese social media users also criticised the lack of reporting on the incident for most of Tuesday.\n\nEyewitness accounts started emerging in the early afternoon, but many of these posts were taken down, according to FreeWeibo, a platform that monitors content on microblogging site Weibo that has been censored or deleted.\n\n\"What's shocking is not only the loss of lives, but also the terrible silence of media outlets which were but spectators of the incident. The official announcements we read leave out the enormous grief caused by the disaster,\" wrote a Weibo user.\n\n\"The media used to serve a watchdog role, to point out social ills. But what about today? What is the media today?\"", "Darya Dugina was vocal in her support for the Russian government over the invasion of Ukraine\n\nThe daughter of a close ally of Russia's President Vladimir Putin has been killed in a suspected car bombing.\n\nDarya Dugina, 29, died after an explosion on a road outside Moscow, Russia's investigative committee said.\n\nIt is thought her father, the Russian philosopher Alexander Dugin, who is known as \"Putin's brain\", may have been the intended target of the attack.\n\nMr Dugin is a prominent ultra-nationalist ideologue who is believed to be close to the Russian president.\n\nAlexander Dugin and his daughter had been at a festival near Moscow, where the philosopher gave a lecture on Saturday evening.\n\nThe \"Tradition\" festival describes itself as a family event for art lovers which takes place at the Zakharovo estate, where Russian poet Alexander Pushkin once stayed.\n\nThe pair were due to leave the venue in the same car, before Mr Dugin reportedly made a decision at the last minute to travel separately.\n\nFootage posted on Telegram appears to show Mr Dugin watching in shock as emergency services arrive at the scene of the burning wreck of a vehicle.\n\nInvestigators confirmed that Ms Dugina, who was driving the car, died at the scene near the village of Bolshiye Vyazemy.\n\nThey said an explosive device planted under the car went off and the vehicle caught fire. Forensic and explosive experts are investigating.\n\nA Ukrainian official has dismissed accusations of Ukrainian involvement in the incident.\n\n\"Ukraine, of course, has nothing to do with this, because we are not a criminal state, which is the Russian Federation, and even less a terrorist state,\" said Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nMaria Zakharova, spokeswoman for Russia's foreign ministry, said in a Telegram post that if any Ukrainian link was found it would amount to \"state terrorism\".\n\nWhile Alexander Dugin is not a state official himself, he is nevertheless a symbolic figure in Russian politics.\n\nHis anti-Western, ultranationalist philosophy has become the dominant political ideology in Russia and has helped shape President Putin's expansionist foreign policy, most prominently on Ukraine.\n\nAttention will now turn to who was behind this attack. Denis Pushilin, the \"head\" of the self-declared pro-Russian \"Donetsk People's Republic\", has already laid the blame on Ukraine, writing on Telegram: \"Vile villains! The terrorists of the Ukrainian regime, trying to eliminate Alexander Dugin, blew up his daughter\u2026 In a car. We cherish the memory of Daria, she is a real Russian girl!\"\n\nIncidents like this will make officials in Moscow nervous, especially in the aftermath of a series of explosions and attacks in occupied Crimea and in Russian regions near the border with Ukraine.\n\nKremlin propaganda consistently stresses how Vladimir Putin has brought security and stability in Russia following the turbulent 1990s, when car bombs and assassinations were commonplace. This car bomb in the Russian capital undermines that narrative.\n\nDespite not holding an official position in government, Alexander Dugin is believed to be a close ally of the Russian president and has even been branded \"Putin's Rasputin\".\n\nDarya Dugina was herself a prominent journalist who vocally supported the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nEarlier this year she was sanctioned by US and UK authorities, who accused her of contributing to online \"disinformation\" about Russia's invasion.\n\nIn May, she described the war as a \"clash of civilisations\" in an interview and expressed pride in the fact that both she and her father had been targeted by Western sanctions.\n\nRussian investigators at the scene of the vehicle explosion\n\nAlexander Dugin was sanctioned by the US in 2015 for his alleged involvement in Russia's annexation of Crimea.\n\nHis writings are said to have had a deep influence on Mr Putin and the philosopher is regarded as a chief architect of the ultra-nationalist ideology endorsed by many in the Kremlin.\n\nFor years, Mr Dugin has called on Moscow to assert itself more aggressively on the global stage and has supported Russian military action in Ukraine.", "Last updated on .From the section Man City\n\nManchester City striker Erling Haaland has broken the record for most goals in a Premier League season.\n\nThe Norwegian scored his 35th league goal of the campaign against West Ham to move past Alan Shearer and Andrew Cole's previous best of 34.\n\nHaaland had already set a record for a 38-game season, beating Mohamed Salah's 32 goals for Liverpool in 2017-18.\n\n\"It's a special night and a special moment. I'm really happy and proud,\" Haaland told Sky Sports.\n\nThe 22-year-old has another five games to add to his tally.\n\n\"It feels amazing and I'm really happy and I'm also happy for the three points,\" he told BBC Match of the Day. \"In the end that's what matters and I'm happy.\n\n\"Yeah, it's going well and now it's time to focus on game by game. I've said this for a long time and that's what the team is doing.

Last week, Singapore joined Malaysia in ruling out a bid, after the Australian state of Victoria withdrew as the original host in July because of rising costs. However, in its first public statement since the news, the CGF said \"significant progress had been made\", and it was \"excited by the early concepts, which aim to reset and reframe the Games\". It claimed it was working with a number of Commonwealth Games Associations (CGAs) over \"further detailed assessments\", with an aim to announce a host in May. It did not identify which countries were involved, saying the CGAs had asked to keep the proposals confidential. \"The CGF continues to accelerate work to refresh the Games\u2026 including exploring innovative new concepts,\" it said. \"Importantly, we have been focusing on how we can transform the Games to a collaborative and truly sustainable model, minimising costs and reducing its environmental footprint, whilst increasing social impact.\"\n\nLast month, Malaysia rejected an offer to step in and host the 2026 Games, despite being offered \u00a3100m by the CGF as supporting funds, with its sports ministry claiming it would not cover the overall cost of staging the event. The Games was also left out of a list of 70 major events that UK Sport said it wanted Britain to host in the next 15 years, with the funding agency questioning the value it offered in its current format. The 2022 Games in Birmingham cost almost \u00a3780m, with the city council and local partners contributing about \u00a3180m. The event generated record ticket sales for a Commonwealth Games of 1.5 million, but last year a former adviser to Birmingham City Council said that hosting the event was a mistake. Scrutiny has intensified after the council confirmed in February that it would raise council tax by 21% over the next two years amid budget savings after declaring itself effectively bankrupt.\n\nHowever, the Department of Culture, Media and Sport says that a new evaluation report has found that the 2022 Games contributed almost \u00a31.2bn to the UK economy, with almost half of that in the West Midlands. It says a surplus of \u00a370m has been reinvested in the region as part of a Legacy Enhancement Fund, and the event boosted regeneration. Birmingham stepped in after the South African city of Durban was stripped of hosting rights in 2017 after missing key deadlines. A host for the 2030 Commonwealth Games is also yet to be confirmed after the government of Alberta, Canada withdrew its support for a bid.", "The rate of price rises at UK supermarkets hit a new high in the year to May due to coffee, chocolate and non-food goods.\n\nThe British Retail Consortium (BRC) and NielsenIQ said that the overall rate of inflation at grocers reached 9%.\n\nWhile prices for fresh food have fallen marginally, the cost of commodities such as coffee and cocoa has jumped.\n\nThe government is in talks about asking supermarkets to cap prices on food items to help with the cost of living.\n\nAn agreement, which would be voluntary, would limit the cost of basic foods such as bread and milk.\n\nBut the BRC has dismissed caps, stating the government should focus on cutting red tape so resources could be \"directed to keeping prices as low as possible\", as opposed to \"recreating 1970s-style price controls\".\n\nOn Monday, Sainsbury's cut the cost of more than 40 of its own-brand products including cheese, yoghurt and cream.\n\n\"Whenever we are paying less for the products we buy from our suppliers, we will pass those savings on to customers,\" said Rhian Bartlett, its food commercial director.\n\nThe BRC and NielsenIQ figures, covering the week between 1 and 6 May, show that overall food inflation ticked lower from 15.7% in the year to April to 15.4%.\n\nDespite the fall, the figure is the second highest rate of food inflation on record.\n\nA decline in the rate of price rises does not mean food costs have fallen, it simply means they are going up at a slower pace.\n\nMeanwhile, the pace of price rises for non-food goods grew from 5.5% in the year to April to 5.8% in May.\n\nThis is despite supermarkets making \"heavy discounts\" on goods such as footwear, books and home entertainment, according to Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC.\n\nFresh produce showed a slowdown in price rises, from 17.8% to 17.2% in May.\n\nIn April, supermarkets cut the price of milk by 5p, taking cost of a pint to 90p. However, that is still almost double pre-Covid prices in March 2020.\n\nPrice growth for ambient foods - which are goods that can be stored at room temperature - rose in the year to May from 12.9% to 13.1%. It is the fastest increase on ambient foods prices on record, said the BRC and NielsenIQ.\n\nMs Dickinson said: \"The price of chocolate and coffee rose off the back of the ongoing high global costs for these commodities.\"\n\nLast week, official figures showed that the overall headline rate of inflation had fallen sharply to 8.7% in April - the first time it fell under 10% since August.\n\nHowever, the drop was less than economists and investors had expected after grocery price rises remained close to the highest rate in 45 years.\n\nIt is also still more than four times the Bank of England's 2% target rate of inflation. The Bank has lifted interest rates 12 times in a row to 4.5% in an attempt to calm price rises.\n\nBut following the higher-than-expected figure for April, some analysts speculated that interest rates could reach 5.5% by the end of the year.\n\nFood production costs have risen due to a number of factors including the cost of energy which rose following the end of Covid lockdowns, which pushed up demand, as well as Russia's attack on Ukraine.\n\nRussia, which is a major oil and gas producer, was hit with sanctions.\n\nUkraine - known as the breadbasket of Europe - is one of the biggest exporters of grain in the world and has seen shipments severely disrupted because of the war.\n\nAdverse weather conditions in some parts of Europe and Africa also impacted some fresh vegetables earlier this year, leading to supermarkets introducing customer limits on sales of peppers, tomatoes and cucumber.\n\nWholesale gas prices have started to drop but retailers claim that falling production costs take time to filter through to supermarket shelves due to the long-term contracts they typically sign with food producers.\n\nMike Watkins, head of retailer and business insight at NielsenIQ, said: \"Food retailing in particular is competitive, so hopefully the recent price cuts in fresh foods is a sign that inflation has now peaked, albeit ambient inflation may take a little while longer to slow.\"", "Michael Donnelly, pictured in Belfast on Tuesday, said the police apology was 50 years too late\n\nOne of the \"Hooded Men\", Michael Donnelly, has said he does not accept a police apology over his treatment.\n\nMr Donnelly was one of 14 men arrested in 1971 during internment without trial and questioned by the police and Army.\n\nTwo years ago the Supreme Court ruled that the techniques they were subjected to would be characterised as torture by today's standards.\n\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) made a formal apology to the surviving Hooded Men on Tuesday.\n\nThe public apology came a day after the death of one of the men, Joe Clarke, at the age of 71.\n\nThe apology had been hand delivered to Mr Clarke by his solicitor on Thursday, four days before he died.\n\nMr Donnelly, who is from Londonderry, told BBC Radio Foyle's The North West Today programme that the apology is \"50 years too late\" for him and he said that it personally feels \"fairly meaningless\".\n\n\"I do not accept it - not at all,\" Mr Donnelly said.\n\nDuring their detention, the Hooded Men said they were forced to listen to constant loud static noise; deprived of sleep, food and water; forced to stand in stress positions; and beaten if they fell.\n\nThe men also said they were hooded and thrown from helicopters a short distance off the ground, having been told they were hundreds of feet in the air.\n\nPSNI Det Ch Supt Ian Saunders said the police had issued the apology for the \"actions and omissions of police officers involved in their treatment whilst in police custody in 1971\".\n\n\"The police service recognises the significant step taken today in issuing this apology,\" he said.\n\n\"It is our view this was the right thing to do to help give the Hooded Men and their families recognition about how they were treated,\" he added.\n\nSome of the Hooded Men and families gathered after the announcement was made\n\nMr Donnelly described the ordeal of being placed into a helicopter with his hands tied behind his back and being told that he was going to be pushed out from a great height over a body of water.\n\nHe also described at one stage thinking he was going to die during his detention after being severely beaten by his captors.\n\n\"I was trying to survive literally by the second, you could barely breathe at times when you were wearing the hood,\" he said.\n\n\"Sometimes I thought I was going to survive and then other times I thought I was going to die.\"\n\nMr Donnelly said he does not see why he should forgive anyone for his treatment.\n\nThe Hooded Men case has been the subject of multiple legal actions in the UK and Europe for decades.\n\nIn 1976, the European Commission of Human Rights ruled that the five techniques used on the men amounted to torture.\n\nThis ruling was later referred to by the European Court of Human Rights in 1978, which held that the UK had carried out inhuman and degrading treatment, but fell short of defining it as torture.\n\nIn 2019, Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan, Northern Ireland's most senior judge, said their treatment \"would, if it occurred today, properly be characterised as torture\".\n\nIn 2021, the Supreme Court issued their ruling that the men's treatment would be characterised as torture by today's standards.\n\nOn Tuesday, a spokesperson for the UK government said it acknowledged \"the pain and suffering felt by so many during the Troubles\".\n\n\"There are several ongoing legal proceedings in relation to this incident, and therefore it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage,\" the spokesperson said.", "A criminal investigation has been launched into the death of an elderly woman who was struck by police escorting the Duchess of Edinburgh.\n\nHelen Holland, 81, was hit by a police motorbike at a junction in Earl's Court, west London, on 10 May.\n\nThe police watchdog said the constable riding the vehicle was being investigated for offences including causing death by dangerous driving.\n\nIt will then decide whether to refer the case for potential charges.\n\nMs Holland suffered serious injuries in the crash and died two weeks later having suffered \"multiple broken bones and massive internal injuries\", according to her son.\n\nBuckingham Palace said the Duchess of Edinburgh was \"deeply saddened\" by Ms Holland's death\n\nIn addition to causing death by dangerous driving, the officer is being investigated for causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving, as well as potential gross misconduct, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said.\n\nHowever, it does not necessarily mean that charges or disciplinary proceedings will follow.\n\nIOPC director Amanda Rowe said it was crucial a \"thorough, independent investigation\" was carried out \"to establish the full circumstances, which will include the actions and decision making of the officer under investigation\".\n\n\"At the end of our investigation, we will decide whether to refer the matter to the Crown Prosecution Service for a charging decision and whether the officer should face disciplinary proceedings,\" she said.\n\nBuckingham Palace previously said the duchess was \"deeply saddened\" by Ms Holland's death and had sent her \"deepest condolences\" to her family.\n\nA spokesperson for the Met Police said: \"We are aware that the IOPC has launched a criminal investigation in relation to the actions of an MPS officer involved in a fatal collision at West Cromwell Road, on Wednesday, 10 May.\n\n\"We continue to fully support the IOPC as they work to establish the facts around this incident.\n\n\"The officer is currently on restricted duties.\"\n\nFollow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Mr McColl and the government-owned ferry procurement agency CMAL blame each other for the problems.\n\nThe current boss of the shipyard - which was nationalised in 2019 - now expects the first ship, Glen Sannox, to be delivered this autumn, followed by the as-yet unnamed Hull 802 in the late summer of 2024.\n\nMr Gray told MSPs that a \"due diligence\" review of requests for additional funding had found that completing Glen Sannox at the yard was the \"cheapest option open to ministers\".\n\nBut he continued: \"The case for vessel 802 is more challenging - and I have accepted the judgement of the Scottish government accountable officer that the narrow value for money case has not been made.\"\n\nNeil Gray said the value of completing Hull 802 could not be viewed in \"narrow\" monetary terms\n\nThe minister, however, said it was important to look at wider considerations including the impact on the shipyard, the wider community and national resilience.\n\n\"These are not matters that can be taken into account in a pure value for money exercise but clearly they are matters of the utmost importance,\" he said.\n\nWhile the value for money assessment had concluded it could be cheaper to procure a new ferry elsewhere, that would lead to significant delays, as it could not be deployed before at least May 2027, he said.\n\n\"I do not consider it acceptable for our island communities to wait this further period,\" he said.\n\nThe repeated delays in the delivery of Glen Sannox and Hull 802 have had a major impact on the resilience of the ageing CalMac fleet, which has been hit by frequent breakdowns and soaring maintenance costs.\n\nLast year a BBC Scotland documentary - The Great Ferries Scandal - presented evidence that the procurement process may have been rigged in favour of Ferguson Marine.\n\nThe investigation also questioned the quality of the design presented by Ferguson, even though it was given top marks by CMAL's evaluators. CMAL has denied any impropriety.\n\nMr Gray told MSPs he could not rule out further increases in costs for the two ferries because the shipyard was facing inflationary pressures and was still discovering \"design gaps\", some of which dated back many years.\n\nScottish Labour MSP Alex Rowley said what was missing from Mr Gray's statement was an apology.\n\n\"An apology to the islanders who have been so badly let down, an apology to the workers at Ferguson who have been so badly let down - and ultimately an apology to the people of Scotland for outrageous mismanagement of public funds,\" he said.\n\nFor the Scottish Conservatives, Graham Simpson said: \"The building of ferries 801 and 802 has been a shambles from start to finish.\n\n\"In fact, shambles is not a strong enough word. It has been a scandal.\"\n\nBy his opponents' calculation, Neil Gray is the eighth minister to take responsibility for the CalMac ferry-building contract at Ferguson shipyard. He must hope he'll be the last, but he's off to a difficult start.\n\n\"Due diligence\" is business-speak for checking out the prospects, liabilities and risks. Now complete, the cabinet secretary's admission that the second of the ferries no longer provides value for money is embarrassing, and a hostage to further misfortune.\n\nConvention requires that a civil service \"accountable officer\" can be held responsible for releasing government funds, and must be able to tell auditors that spending provides value for money.\n\nFollowing that due diligence, Gregor Irwin, the director-general for economy in the Scottish government, cannot do that on the second hull. So he has written to his political boss, Neil Gray, saying he will have to give written permission to over-ride that rule. It's a way of saying: \"No minister, you're on your own with this.\"\n\nMr Gray has done so, wanting to give the shipyard a chance to succeed after this calamitous contract. Admitting defeat would surely sink the yard, and lose 340 jobs. Further contracts will require further investment, so the Scottish government is now considering the use of even more scarce public funds.\n\nFormer business minister Ivan McKee also hinted at discussions he must know something about, on selling the yard or entering a joint venture with a private company which could deploy it for the renewable energy boom.\n\nThe risk to jobs on the Clyde and Hebridean islands, because the CalMac fleet is old, unreliable and under-capacity, is on a far greater scale than the jobs at stake in Port Glasgow.\n\nThat leads to the other justification: the prospect of an alternative procurement meaning a further delay for islanders, estimated at 30 months beyond the current (though hardly reliable) delivery date for Hull 802.\n\nWhat's missing is the new cost. Officially, the bill stands at \u00a3203m, of which \u00a3105m is for Hull 802. That's over and above the original \u00a397m contract price.\n\nHaving only \u00a36m contingency margin is very low for such a project. The Scottish government sunk more than \u00a350m more into the yard when it drove the previous owners into administration.\n\nAsked at Holyrood about updated costings, Mr Gray declined to say. It seems the yard's chief executive will now have to tot up the bill, including increased costs of supplies.\n\nSo either Neil Gray is not admitting how much more the ships are on course to cost, or he doesn't know. And if he doesn't know, how could he know that the project has failed its \"value for money\" test, or how much more money is being risked, by a decision that the civil service can no longer justify?", "The BBC's Russia Editor has questioned Alexander Lukashenko on nuclear weapons, after Russia recently said it is moving nuclear warheads to Belarus.\n\nDuring a four hour \"conversation\" with journalists at the Palace of Independence in Minsk, Steve Rosenberg asked the leader of Belarus whether he would allow Wagner troops to attack Ukraine from their territory and whether he would really use Russian nuclear weapons.", "Last updated on .From the section Winter Sports\n\nMikaela Shiffrin became the greatest Alpine skier of all time with her 87th World Cup win - exactly 12 years after making her debut.\n\nSlalom victory in Are, Sweden, saw the 27-year-old American surpass the record of 86 held by Swede Ingemar Stenmark since 1989.\n\nShe had drawn level with Stenmark in winning the giant slalom on Friday.\n\nShiffrin, who won her first World Cup in the same resort in 2012, said her achievement was \"hard to comprehend\".\n\nShe clocked one minute 41.77 seconds across her two runs, putting her 0.92 seconds ahead of Switzerland's Wendy Holdener in the standings.\n\n\"The best feeling is to ski on the second run when you have a lead,\" said Shiffrin.\n\n\"You have to be smart but also I just wanted to be fast too and ski the second run like its own race, and I did it exactly how I wanted and that's amazing.\"\n\nShiffrin, who turns 28 on Monday, was surprised on the finish line by her brother, Taylor, who she did not know was in attendance.\n\nThe Colorado native made her World Cup debut on 11 March 2011, competing in the giant slalom in the Czech Republic.\n\nThis season she has amassed 13 wins across all disciplines so far and has secured the overall, slalom and giant slalom World Cup crystal globes.\n\nMeanwhile on the men's World Cup circuit, Marco Odermatt wrapped up his second successive overall title with giant slalom victory in Kranjska Gora.\n\nHe leads Norway's Aleksander Aamodt Kilde by 486 points with five races remaining, but retained his title with Kilde - Shiffrin's partner - skipping this weekend's giant slalom races.", "Sunday's Japanese Grand Prix is live on 5 Live and the BBC Sport website at 06:00 BST\n\nMax Verstappen led a Red Bull one-two in qualifying at the Japanese Grand Prix with McLaren's Lando Norris best of the rest. Ferrari's Carlos Sainz was fourth, his team-mate Charles Leclerc eighth, and Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso fifth. McLaren's Oscar Piastri was sixth ahead of Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton, whose team-mate George Russell was ninth. Japanese Yuki Tsunoda delighted home fans packed into the glorious Suzuka circuit with 10th place.\n\nVerstappen had looked a certainty for pole since the start of the weekend but in the end his margin was perhaps smaller than expected. Perez was just 0.066 seconds adrift of the three-time champion, who had been half a second clear of the field on this same circuit last September. Red Bull, though, were in a league of their own - Norris was 0.292secs off the pace in third, and himself a comfortable 0.193secs ahead of Sainz. Verstappen said he felt it had not been this greatest lap, adding: \"It was quite close at the end. This track is very sensitive with the tyre with the Tarmac being aggressive, and when you really want to go to the limit, it doesn't always work out. \"It is good to be on pole, a good starting position for tomorrow, and tomorrow is what counts.\" Perez said: \"It was really close with Max. It felt like a good lap. It was quite tricky there, especially closing the laps it was easy to lose a couple of 10ths in the last sector. \"We have been really close all weekend and when you are in that, little margins... anything can make a difference. \"I didn't have a great exit (from the chicane) opening the lap; that could have been different. Our long-run pace was not that strong this morning but we have worked quite a bit and hopefully we will be strong.\" Norris was pleased with third, saying McLaren's \"hard work was paying off\" in trying to close the gap to Red Bull. Sainz was 0.485secs from pole, a step forward for Ferrari compared to last year but their least impressive qualifying performance of the year. And Leclerc, while only 0.104secs off the Spaniard, was perplexed as to where his pace has gone this season. Leclerc has been the faster Ferrari driver on balance through their time as team-mates and he has been re-signed for next season alongside Lewis Hamilton while Sainz is looking for a drive. But Sainz has been more impressive this season and Leclerc said after qualifying: \"That's the best I can do. Honestly, I don't get it.\" It was an encouraging day for Alonso, whose Aston Martin has major floor upgrades this weekend and the veteran Spaniard put them to good effect. Second fastest in the first session, Alonso slipped back as qualifying progressed and others found their feet. He was seventh after his first run in the final top 10 shoot-out and was encouraged by his engineer to try to find the extra 0.15secs that separated him from a place in the top four at the time. Alonso replied saying: \"I don't know what to do to go faster; it felt like a good lap.\" But he found almost exactly that time to move up and split the Ferraris and McLarens. The 0.569secs that separated Hamilton from pole was seen as progress at Mercedes. Hamilton said: \"It's been a night and day different weekend so far in terms of how comfortable I felt in the car, we did a really good job of analysis back at the factory to try to understand how we can get the car in a sweeter spot. \"The car has a been much nicer to drive this weekend and particularly at a track like this where you need a nice balance, this is the nicest it's been for three years. \"Last year we were a second off, 0.7secs today.\"\n\nThe race now boasts views of Japan's legendary blossoms with its new April date\n\nBut fans at Suzuka seem more interested in their unique way of celebrating the sport, dressing as cars, horses and even koalas, depending on who they are supporting\n\nQualifying was fairly straightforward, but there was a crash for Logan Sargeant during Friday practice a Suzuka - crashing after the Esses in what is a famously demanding track\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "Mr Rutte has been holding three days of talks to try to save his coalition\n\nThe Dutch government has collapsed because of a disagreement between coalition parties over asylum policies, Prime Minister Mark Rutte has said.\n\nThe four parties were split in crisis talks chaired by Mr Rutte on Friday.\n\nMr Rutte then met King Willem-Alexander in The Hague on Saturday and agreed to lead a caretaker government until fresh elections, expected in mid-November.\n\nCoalition partners had objected to his proposal to restrict the scope for immigrant families to reunite.\n\nThe government was set up a year and a half ago but the parties have been opposed on migration for some time.\n\nMr Rutte gave no details of his talks with the king, which lasted about an hour and a half. \"It was a good discussion, but I'm not saying anything else because these discussions are confidential,\" he told reporters.\n\nHis conservative VVD party had been trying to limit the flow of asylum seekers, following a row last year about overcrowded migration centres.

The current government - which took office in January 2022 - is his fourth coalition.\n\nHe said he still had the energy for a fifth term, but a final decision would have to await consultations with his party.\n\nHe has been under pressure on migration because of the rise of far-right parties such as Geert Wilders' PVV.\n\nThe Farmer-Citizen Movement (BBB), which became the biggest party in the upper house of parliament after a shock election win in March, said they will not serve in any future government led by Mr Rutte.", "Coach driver Anthony Jones - who sent this picture - described a \"frustrating\" situation with queues at the port\n\nTravellers at Dover remain in long queues to catch ferries to France after waits in excess of 12 hours - although port authorities say the situation is now improving for new arrivals.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC on Sunday evening, parents told of coachloads of children still waiting to cross the Channel after arriving late on Saturday.\n\nPort managers said all traffic was now inside the port ready for processing.\n\nDisruption and delays were first reported on Friday night.\n\nExtra ferries that were laid on overnight on Saturday were not enough to prevent the queues at Dover increasing through much of Sunday.\n\nOfficials cite slower border processing and a higher-than-expected number of coaches as causes of the delays.\n\nThe port said late on Sunday that around 40 coaches were still awaiting immigration processing, down from 111 earlier in the day.\n\nP&O Ferries said that around 20 coaches were still waiting to board its ferries and that their wait time would be around five hours.\n\nThe company had earlier said wait times were around 10 hours, though many coach passengers and drivers contacted the BBC to say their waits had actually been much longer.\n\nOne driver taking a group from Cardiff to Austria said they had been in the vehicle for 14 hours.\n\nCoach passengers ended up camping on the floor of a service station in Folkestone, due to delays in nearby Dover\n\nOn Saturday evening, holidaymaker Jennifer Fee said her coach was \"turning around and going back to London\" having been told there was \"no chance of a ferry today\".\n\nMs Fee sent the BBC footage of passengers camped out on the floor of a service station in nearby Folkestone - where coaches had been \"stacked up\" due to delays at the port.\n\nCoach driver Zaishan Aslam was driving a group of schoolchildren from Cheltenham to Italy. He told the BBC they all arrived in Dover at 14:00 BST on Friday, and were finally on a ferry at 03:30 on Saturday.\n\nThe group have now arrived at their final destination, but Mr Aslam said they are coming back to the UK on Friday and he dreads to think what the situation with the ferries will be then.\n\nThe situation is \"totally ridiculous\", Mr Aslam said. \"It's as if it was caused deliberately to deter coach drivers and schoolchildren from travelling\".\n\nRob Howard, a teacher in Dorset travelling by coach with a group of schoolchildren, was on his way to northern Italy via Dover.\n\nThey arrived at the port at 16:00 on Saturday, but the group decided to turn around after waiting for more than 17 hours, Mr Howard said.\n\nHe said passengers were each given a chocolate bar and less than a bottle of water during those 17 hours, and \"there was a smell of urine all over the place\" as some coach toilets leaked.\n\nThe government has said it is in close contact with port authorities.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg show, Home Secretary Suella Braverman said the delays were a result of a \"combination of factors\", including the high volume of coaches.\n\nShe said she sympathised with families and school children trying to get away on Easter holidays, and expected the problems to ease soon.\n\nLabour's shadow levelling-up secretary, Lisa Nandy, told Sky News issues like the port delays could have been avoided \"if the government got a grip, got down to brass tacks and started doing the actual job\".\n\nOfficials have explained that long border processing times were partly to blame for delays - and ferry companies said bad weather had disrupted some journeys.\n\nThe port said ferry companies received 15% more coach bookings for the Easter period than what had been expected. Boarding coachloads of passengers is much slower than boarding cars.\n\nResponding to claims of lengthy delays in border checks, officials in northern France said on Saturday that there were \"no difficulties that we know of,\" but that many coaches had arrived to travel at around the same time.\n\nAll border checkpoints were operational and border police had switched some car checkpoints into slots for coaches, French officials added.\n\nSimon Calder, travel correspondent at the Independent, said processing times since the UK left the EU had increased sharply \"and that would seem to explain the delays\".\n\nAn EU border at Dover meant things were \"gumming up\", as each individual passport had to be inspected and stamped after Brexit, he told the BBC on Saturday.\n\nAsked whether the delays were a result of Brexit, Labour's Ms Nandy said: \"The point is not whether we left the European Union or not... the point was that we left with a government that made big promises and once again didn't deliver.\"\n\nAnd speaking to Sky News, Ms Braverman said viewing delays at the port as \"an adverse effect of Brexit\" would not be a fair assessment.\n\nMany coaches stuck in Dover have been carrying schoolchildren from across the UK on school trips abroad.\n\nSchoolteacher Sarah Dalby told the BBC her group began their journey from Nottinghamshire and 24 hours later were still in the queue for passport control at Dover.\n\n\"Nobody has been to speak to us in the whole time.

He was sentenced to life with a minimum term of 11 years.\n\nA year later, Hassan Razzaq, the brother of Faisal, was also convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 20 years in prison.\n\nThat same year, Raza Ul Haq Aslam, was convicted of robbery and jailed for eight years.\n\nHowever, two suspects remained at large. One was Mustaf Jama, who had used a friend's passport to flee to his native Somalia. The other wanted man, Piran Ditta Khan, had escaped to Pakistan.\n\nJama was eventually extradited in 2007 when he was smuggled out of Africa in an undercover operation. The brother of Yusuf Jama, he was found guilty of murder and jailed for life with a minimum term of 35 years.\n\nBut it was to be another 17 years before Khan was to face justice for his role as the robbery's instigator.\n\nPiran Ditta Khan fled to Pakistan after PC Beshenivsky's murder in 2005, but was extradited in 2023\n\nBack in 2006, when Mr Brennan was piecing together the investigation, detectives built a picture that showed Khan was the mastermind behind the plot.\n\nKhan had used the travel agents to send money to Pakistan and knew that \"substantial amounts\" of cash would be held at the premises.\n\nLooking back, Mr Brennan says: \"The information we were getting was that he was more important in relation to the organisation of what had taken place than any of the other six individuals.\n\n\"The more information and evidence we got, the clearer his role became of being an instigator.\"\n\nBut by the time police were in a position to arrest him, Khan had already fled to Pakistan - something Mr Brennan says was \"seriously disappointing\".\n\nGetting Khan back to face justice was a long and drawn-out process.\n\nBecause there is no extradition treaty between the UK and Pakistan, a diplomatic request was made by the UK for his removal.\n\nMr Brennan said: \"I spent about 12 to 18 months every week going down to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Home Office.\n\n\"I was meeting them on a weekly basis to say, this is the position we're in, these are the individuals we want back.\n\n\"We put pressure on them [the authorities in Pakistan] all the time, but effectively we were in their hands to arrest one of their citizens.\"\n\nUp until January 2020, Khan remained free. However, he was eventually arrested in Pakistan, with his solicitor describing him as a \"scared and shivering man\".\n\nIt then took another three years before Khan was brought back to the UK.\n\nBy the time of Khan's extradition, Mr Brennan had retired from West Yorkshire Police, but recalls being \"elated\" by the development.\n\n\"I knew this was always bubbling away in the background and would never be allowed to go away,\" he says.\n\n\"When I left the case it wasn't complete, but it never left me.\n\n\"So, when I found out he was on his way back to the UK, I was incredibly pleased. I remember having a glass of wine.\"\n\nMr Brennan describes Khan as a \"very dangerous man\" who was \"incredibly greedy\" and \"entirely responsible\" for what had taken place.\n\nThe former officer says: \"He managed to persuade a group to commit this robbery on the pretext that there was a significant amount of money there.\n\n\"But they fled with \u00a35,000 and committed the murder of a police officer on duty.\"\n\nTeresa Milburn, who was also injured, said her colleague PC Beshenivsky did not stand a chance against the gunmen\n\nNow all those responsible for the events of 18 November 2005 have been convicted, Mr Brennan says he believes the bravery of both PC Beshenvisky and PC Milburn should be officially recognised.\n\n\"I know this case inside out and I look back on their actions that day,\" he says.\n\n\"They turned up to a silent alarm taking place - that would usually indicate a robbery or something more serious - and in that knowledge they approached the premises.\n\n\"Both Sharon and Teresa are extremely brave to have done what they did. They could have waited by their cars or could have radioed for armed assistance, but they didn't.\n\n\"I think that was down to the fact they wanted to protect the public and make sure the occupants in the travel agents were safe and well.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Brennan says that though Khan's conviction may have been a long time in the making, he was never in any doubt the promise he made to PC Beshenivsky's family would be fulfilled.\n\n\"I made it perfectly clear to Sharon's family, to Teresa and to the public, that we would leave no stone unturned to get justice,\" he says.\n\n\"I had a superb team working with me who gave 110%.\n\n\"So, in my mind, I was confident we would find everyone involved on that horrific day.\"\n\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

The force has declined to comment.\n\nWildcat Haven, based in St Asaph, Denbighshire, has said he suffered \"physiological and psychological trauma\", and has made a number of claims about police actions.\n\nWildcat Haven's lawyer, Joseph Morgan, said the group found the animal dehydrated, soaking wet and close to death as a three-week-old kitten in the Scottish Highlands.\n\nBelieving he was a Scottish wildcat, he was taken to an enclosure in Conwy for rehabilitation before eventual release.\n\nPlans to release Finlay in spring 2022 were derailed on Valentine's Day in February that year, when officers took him from the farm claiming he was being held without a licence.\n\nWildcat Haven claimed no licence was required to rehabilitate Finlay.\n\nMr Morgan said: \"North Wales Police acted excessively in seizing Finlay from Wildcat Haven's care and holding on to him for over four months.\n\n\"In doing so, they undermined months of hard work that went into rehabilitating Finlay for release into the wild, meaning that Wildcat Haven has had to start from square one in their journey to see Finlay in the wild again.\"\n\nWildcat Haven is also unhappy police do not believe Finlay is a wildcat, but a domestic tabby with some wildcat genes.\n\nThe assessment could pose problems for the group if it does release Finlay into the wild, as it could be committing an offence under the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006.\n\nFinlay was not returned until 28 June 2022, allegedly in a \"very poor state\". Wildcat Haven said it took more than six months to bring him back to good health.\n\nIts director Emily O'Donoghue said: \"Finlay was wrongly seized as no licence is required for the rehabilitation and release of a Scottish wildcat.\"\n\nShe claimed that he was kept \"in a quarantine cage for four-and-a-half months\", and on his return he was \"emaciated\".\n\nWildcat Haven said Finlay was discovered in the Scottish Highlands as a kitten\n\n\"The police returned him because they said he was a domestic tabby cat, even though an assessment of him arranged by the police gave him a score which should have identified him as a Scottish wildcat, according to the scientific literature,\" Ms O'Donoghue said.\n\nThe police, she claimed, caused Finlay to \"suffer unnecessarily\" and delayed his release.\n\n\"We will continue to fight for his freedom,\" she said.\n\nWhile North Wales Police has declined to comment on Wildcat Haven's claims, it has previously said it kept Finlay at a special facility where it had regular visits and vet assessments.\n\nIt said there was no evidence of disease and Finlay displayed traits of domestic cat behaviour.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "What started with pictures in Edinburgh, took Ross Burns to locations all around the UK including the Finnieston Crane in Glasgow\n\nWhen Ross Burns first took a photo of one of his son's toy cars while on a daily walk he did not think it would turn into an obsession that has seen him complete 1,000 days of taking pictures in different locations.\n\nIt started as a lockdown project in 2020 but he caught the bug and it turned into a three-year project capturing images of his son's Hot Wheels miniature cars in locations from Edinburgh Castle to Buckingham Palace.\n\nThe 43-year-old, from Edinburgh, said he started taking out the toy cars when he went for walks with his six-year-old son Daniel.\n\nHe posted the pictures on his Instagram account and received an encouraging reaction.

Watch: Ros Atkins on... the Russian social media videos appearing to show Kremlin drone attack\n\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has denied his country carried out an alleged drone attack on the Kremlin, which Russia says was an attempt on President Vladimir Putin's life.\n\n\"We don't attack Putin or Moscow. We fight on our territory. We are defending our villages and cities,\" he said, speaking on a visit to Finland.\n\nThe Russian president's office said defences downed two drones overnight.\n\nIt threatened to retaliate when and where it considered necessary.\n\nUnverified footage circulating online shows smoke rising over the Kremlin - a large government complex in central Moscow - early on Wednesday. A second video shows a small explosion above the site's Senate building, while two men appear to clamber up the dome.\n\nThe Russian presidency said Ukraine had attempted a strike on Mr Putin's residence in the Kremlin and described it as \"a planned terrorist act and an assassination attempt on the president\".\n\nOfficials said two drones targeting the complex had been disabled using electronic radar assets, adding that President Putin had not been in the complex at the time of the alleged attack.\n\nBut Ukraine has said the Russian accusations are merely a pretext for massive attacks on its territory and the US says it is treating the Russian claims with a lot of caution.\n\nMr Putin appears to be one of the most closely-guarded leaders in the world. At Putin events in Moscow attended by BBC journalists, extremely tight security has been in place, including extensive checks and long convoys of vehicles with airspace closed and traffic halted.\n\nHowever if what the Kremlin is saying is true, it will raise questions about how well protected the president really is.\n\nThere will also be scrutiny over the effectiveness of Russian air defences. In recent months, anti-aircraft systems have been spotted on Moscow rooftops in the vicinity of key buildings.\n\nThey have been placed there because the Kremlin is concerned that Ukraine, or those sympathetic to Ukraine, may attempt to carry out aerial attacks on high-value targets.\n\nWhatever actually happened on Wednesday morning, the question now is how Russia will respond. Some officials have already called for tough action. Russian generals have warned many times of harsh responses to any strikes on Russian territory.\n\nBut it is unclear whether Russia has the capacity to carry out meaningful retaliatory strikes, or whether this incident will lead to any significant escalation on the battlefield inside Ukraine.\n\nA Ukrainian presidential adviser told the BBC the incident indicated Russia could be \"preparing a large-scale terrorist provocation\" in Ukraine.\n\nMykhailo Podolyak said attacking Moscow made no sense for Ukraine but would help Russia justify its own attacks on civilian targets.\n\nOn Wednesday Russian strikes on Ukraine's southern Kherson region killed 21 people. Mr Zelensky said the shelling had hit \"a railway station and a crossing, a house, a hardware store, a grocery supermarket and a gas station\". The victims included supermarket customers and employees of an energy company who were performing repairs, officials said.\n\nMr Podolyak added that any drones flying over locations in Russia were down to \"guerrilla activities of local resistance forces\".\n\n\"Something is happening in RF [Russian Federation], but definitely without Ukraine's drones over the Kremlin,\" Mr Podolyak said.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he could not validate Russia's accusation that Ukraine had tried to kill Mr Putin, but said he would take anything the Russian presidency said with a \"very large shaker of salt\".\n\nMick Mulroy, a former US deputy assistant secretary of defence and CIA officer, told the BBC that if reports of the incident were accurate, it was \"unlikely\" to be an assassination attempt as Ukraine tracks President Putin's movements closely and he was not in Moscow at the time.\n\n\"This may have been to show the Russian people that they can be hit anywhere and that the war they started in Ukraine may eventually come home to Russia, even the capital,\" he said.\n\nAlternatively, if the reports were not accurate, \"Russia may be fabricating this to use as a pretext to target President Zelensky - something they have tried to in the past\", Mr Mulroy said.\n\nRussia also noted the alleged drone incident had come shortly before Russia's 9 May Victory Day parade in Moscow, which foreign dignitaries were expected to attend.\n\nThe parade will go ahead as planned, Russian officials said.\n\nMoscow's mayor on Wednesday announced a ban on unauthorised drone flights over the city.\n\nSeveral Russian cities had already announced they would scale back this year's Victory Day celebrations.\n\nRussian authorities have cited security reasons and attacks from pro-Ukrainian forces for the changes.

It included text quoting the number of homes in the South West of England which used renewable electricity. The ASA ruled the poster was misleading because it gave the impression that Shell as a whole was providing cleaner energy.\n\nThe ASA said Shell's poster gave the wrong impression that overall, Shell provided predominantly clean energy across its whole business\n\n\"We also considered that the emphasis the ads placed on \"Ready\", implied that lower-carbon energy products, like those shown in the ads, already comprised a significant proportion of the energy products Shell invested in and sold in the UK, or were likely to do so in the near future,\" the ASA said.\n\nA spokesperson for Shell said the ASA's decision \"could slow the UK's drive towards renewable energy\".\n\n\"No energy transition can be successful if people are not aware of the alternatives available to them. That is what our adverts set out to show, and that is why we're concerned by this short-sighted decision,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nThe ruling comes as the ASA is combatting companies overstating their environmental friendliness, known as \"corporate greenwashing\".

But when I do come back and when I do see you, I hope you're still up for watching us.\"\n\nIt leaves a question mark hanging over the singer's summer schedule, which includes slots at the Reading and Leeds Festivals and two dates in Edinburgh.\n\nCapaldi's health problems date back to the pandemic, when he went back to his hometown for the Covid lockdown, expecting to start work on his second album.\n\nHis first, Divinely Uninspired to a Hellish Extent, sold more than any other in the UK in 2019 and it would go on to be the biggest seller in 2020 as well.\n\nIt meant expectations were high for album number two. He was feeling the pressure, and it would take its toll physically and mentally.\n\n\"Making the first album was as close to dreams coming true as you could possibly get,\" the Scottish singer-songwriter told the makers of a Netflix documentary about his life.\n\n\"But as soon as the first album does well, it's like can he do it again though?\"\n\nCapaldi celebrated with a bottle of Buckfast when he won a Brit Award in 2020\n\nLewis Capaldi: How I Feel Now follows the rise of the star from his childhood in Whitburn, West Lothian, to chart success, a sold-out arena tour and celebrity status.\n\nThe self-proclaimed \"Scottish Beyonc\u00e9\" and \"America's sweetheart\" has also won a huge following on social media, thanks to his unfiltered humour and a willingness to poke fun at himself.\n\n\"A global pandemic is only in the top three weird things to have happened to me in the last three years,\" he tells programme makers.\n\nBut the documentary also looks at the effect that rapid success has had on his mental health, leaving him dealing with panic attacks, a shoulder twitch and a diagnosis of Tourette Syndrome.\n\nAnd it tackles his \"imposter syndrome\", which even a kind email from Elton John telling him he writes \"beautiful songs that resonate with millions\" cannot correct.\n\nAfter reading the email aloud, Capaldi says: \"It's nice but I obviously still feel like an imposter. I don't think it's ever going to go away.\"\n\nElton John has called Capaldi the next British superstar\n\nDuring the documentary his shoulder twitch appears to worsen as he continues writing - apparently fruitlessly - for his second album.\n\nLacking confidence in his own abilities, he works with other songwriters first over Zoom from his parents' garden shed, then travelling to London and Los Angeles.\n\nBut he sets himself a high bar, judging everything against Someone You Loved - his breakout single which reached number one on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\n\"I'm not confident in my abilities as a songwriter and I think that's got worse the more successful I've got,\" he says.\n\n\"The twitch that I have gets worse when I sit down to play the piano. Physically painful,\" he tells the documentary makers.\n\n\"And I get really short of breath and it's like my back kills me when I go to do it. Which is quite ... frightful.\"\n\nCapaldi agonised over song-writing for the new album\n\nCapaldi also speaks candidly about the panic attacks he suffers from, which make him feel like he's \"going insane\".\n\n\"I'm completely disconnected from reality,\" he says. \"I can't breathe, I can't feel breath going in. I get dizzy, I feel like something's happening in my head and I'm sweating.\n\n\"My whole body starts to do what my shoulder does and I'm convulsing. Either I feel like I'm going to be stuck like that forever or I'm going to die.\"\n\nHe can spend up to seven hours on the phone to his mum, Carol, as she tries to calm him down.\n\nTo Capaldi, those physical symptoms are a perfectly reasonable reaction to having his \"world turned upside down\".\n\n\"For me it's a like a completely normal reaction to this. If you are put in this situation, you are going to have something like this, especially if you are already an anxious person, which I guess I was.\n\n\"I didn't ever have the pressure that came to make me full blown but we are there now so we just need to deal with it.\"\n\nLewis Capaldi's debut, Divinely Uninspired To A Hellish Extent, was the UK's biggest-selling album of 2019 and 2020\n\nA therapist has told him some of his issues relate to the death of two close relatives as a child, including the aunt whose suicide inspired Before You Go.\n\nIt feeds his anxieties about his own heath and mortality.\n\nCarol says her son - like everyone - is complicated: \"He's not just the comedian that we all think he is.\"\n\n\"And that's where the conflict possibly is as well,\" adds his dad, Mark. \"Because the darkness comes over the happy chappy guy and manifests itself in all the tics, the anxiety and all the other things that he's kind of surrounded in.\"\n\nDespite initially resisting the efforts of his family and friends to get treatment for his debilitating twitch, writing and recording for the second album was eventually put on hold for the sake of his mental health.\n\nThat's when he was diagnosed with Tourette Syndrome, a condition that causes people to make involuntary sounds or movements called tics.\n\nIt was a diagnosis that made \"complete sense\" to the singer and reassured the self-confessed hypochondriac that he was not dying.\n\nHe's been told that he will see a marked improvement if he can reduce his anxiety - something he is trying to do with medication, exercise and (relatively) healthy eating.\n\nLewis Capaldi: How I'm Feeling Now is on Netflix.

Prof Dame Sally Davies tells the Covid inquiry that \"it wasn't just the deaths, it was the way they died\".\n\nEngland's former chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies was close to tears at the Covid Inquiry as she apologised to families bereaved by the pandemic.\n\n\"It wasn't just the deaths, it was the way they died... it was harrowing and it remains horrible,\" she said.\n\nShe also said the UK did not have enough resilience to cope with the pandemic, with fewer doctors, nurses or hospital beds than similar countries.\n\nThe inquiry is currently examining the UK's preparedness ahead of Covid.\n\nIn her evidence, Dame Sally also expressed concern about the impact of the lockdowns on children and students.\n\n\"We have damaged a generation, and it is awful... watching these people struggle,\" she said.\n\nThe former chief medical officer told the inquiry the UK did not have plans in place to cope with a Covid pandemic, but she added \"it didn't have resilience either\".\n\nCompared with similar countries, the UK was at the bottom of the table for numbers of doctors, nurses, beds, IT units and ventilators per 100,000, she said.\n\nDuring questions about preparation exercises for pandemics, Dame Sally broke off to say: \"Maybe this is the moment to say how sorry I am to the relatives who lost their families.\"\n\n\"I heard a lot about it from my daughter who was on the front line as a doctor in Scotland,\" she added.\n\nDame Sally Davies became chief medical officer in 2010 and left in 2019 to be replaced by Sir Chris Whitty.

There was also an overall squeeze on health spending.\n\nGeorge Osborne was quizzed on the impact of spending cuts\n\nMr Osborne - who was chancellor from 2010 to 2016 - said: \"If we had not done that Britain would have been more exposed, not just to future things like the coronavirus pandemic, but indeed to the fiscal crisis which very rapidly followed in countries across Europe.\n\n\"If we had not had a clear plan to put the public finances on a sustainable path then Britain might have experienced a fiscal crisis, we would not have had the fiscal space to deal with the coronavirus pandemic when it hit.\"\n\nThe British Medical Association said Mr Osborne's \"denial\" of a connection between austerity and the impact of the pandemic on the most vulnerable was \"staggering\".\n\nOn Monday, the Trades Union Congress (TUC) produced a report which said austerity had led to unsafe staffing in public services leaving the UK \"hugely unprepared\" for Covid.\n\nDuring the one hour 20 minute question session, Mr Osborne was also asked about the Treasury's planning for potential national lockdown.\n\nHe said the department had plans for an outbreak of influenza but added \"given what subsequently happened that was very small scale\".\n\n\"There was no planning done by Treasury - or any western Treasury - for asking the entire population to stay at home for months and months on end.\n\n\"If someone had said to you the UK government should be preparing for a lockdown that might last for months, then I have no doubt the Treasury would have developed schemes it did subsequently develop around the furlough and the Covid loans.\n\n\"Planning could have been done for a furlough scheme in advance - I'm not clear that would have made a better furlough scheme than the one we as a country actually saw.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, Sir Oliver Letwin, a senior minister in David Cameron's government, told the inquiry a rapid turnover of civil service staff hindered the government's ability to plan for pandemics.\n\nHe also warned that the UK was \"wildly under-resilient\" and said there should be a minister \"solely devoted\" to the subject.\n\nLabour said the admissions were \"too little, too late\", adding the Conservatives \"cannot be trusted to protect the public from the emergencies of tomorrow\".\n\nSign up for our UK morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.", "The bullet that killed Olivia was fired through the front door\n\nA man has been found guilty of murdering nine-year-old Olivia Pratt-Korbel, who was fatally shot in her home in Liverpool.\n\nThomas Cashman, 34, killed Olivia and injured her mother Cheryl Korbel as he chased a fellow drug dealer into their home on the evening of 22 August.\n\nThere were gasps and tears in court as he was convicted, with Ms Korbel later saying she felt \"ecstatic\".\n\nMerseyside Police said Cashman was \"not worthy of walking the streets\".\n\nCashman, who was also found guilty of wounding Ms Korbel, the attempted murder of Joseph Nee and possession of firearms with intent to endanger life, will be sentenced on Monday.\n\nThe jury of 10 men and two women at Manchester Crown Court took nine hours and three minutes to reach their unanimous verdicts.\n\nBBC Panorama investigates how Liverpool came to dominate the UK drug market and how organised crime brought death to Olivia Pratt-Korbel's door.\n\nMs Korbel, 46, wearing a pink cardigan and holding a teddy bear, sat with her children Chloe and Ryan in the court as the verdicts were read out.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nCashman wiped away tears in the dock and turned to his family in the public gallery behind, shaking his head.\n\nOne of his relatives could be heard saying \"appeal it\" and they left the courtroom shouting and swearing.\n\nDuring the trial, the jury heard 36-year-old Nee, who has a number of previous convictions, was the intended target of the attack.\n\nCashman, who made up to \u00a35,000 per week dealing cannabis in Liverpool, had been lying in wait for his fellow drug dealer at about 22:00 BST, the jury was told.\n\nHe shot at Nee in the street and wounded him but his gun jammed as he tried to finish the job.\n\nThomas Cashman was convicted following a trial, which lasted more than three weeks\n\nNee fled for his life - heading towards the light of an open door - the home of Ms Korbel, who had heard the commotion.\n\nBut, as she tried to close the door to keep the strangers out, Cashman shot again.\n\nThe bullet went through the door, through her hand, and fatally hit Olivia in the chest.\n\nCashman then fled the scene, running across back gardens.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

A child gunned down inside her own home, where she should have been safest.\n\nThe case is considered a real low. But it's not a new low for Liverpool.\n\nEerily, exactly 15 years to the very day, 11-year-old Rhys Jones was fatally shot by a stray bullet.\n\nOlivia's murder carried the sense of history repeating itself.\n\nMaybe that's why it provoked such a strong reaction within the local community.\n\nDetectives say that information flowed into their incident room in a volume they haven't experienced before.\n\nAnd even some of those who might have been expected to put up a wall of silence spoke out.\n\nCriminals talked about \"a line having been crossed\".\n\nDuring the trial, Cashman, a father-of-two, had told the court he had been at a friend's house where he counted \u00a310,000 in cash and smoked a spliff at around the time of the shooting.\n\nBut a woman, who had had a fling with Cashman, told the jury he came to her house after the shooting, where he changed his clothes and she heard him say he had \"done Joey\".\n\nIt can now also be reported that Paul Russell, 41, admitted driving Cashman away from a house where he fled to following Olivia's murder and disposing of his clothing.\n\nRussell, of Snowberry Road, Liverpool, pleaded guilty to assisting an offender at a hearing at Liverpool Crown Court in October and will also be sentenced on Monday.\n\nJournalists were prevented from reporting his plea until the conclusion of Cashman's trial.\n\nDet Supt Mark Baker, the senior investigating officer in the case, said Cashman's actions were \"abhorrent\".\n\nHe said officers were still \"hunting down\" those who had enabled Olivia's murder and finding the weapons, which had not yet been recovered, was key.\n\n\"When he found out that he had shot an innocent young girl, he should have had the courage to stand up and come forward,\" he said.\n\n\"Instead, he chose to lie low despite the fact that he was a dad himself.\n\n\"He is not worthy of walking the streets of Merseyside, and neither are those who think they can bring fear or intimidation to our communities through the use of firearms.\"\n\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

They did not want to draw attention to their school - or pupils who identify as trans or non-binary.\n\nIn 2018, the government said it would work with the human-rights watchdog to publish \"comprehensive guidance for schools on how to support trans pupils\". Without it, many schools are making their own decisions, such as whether to introduce gender-neutral toilets or changing rooms - and how they are used.\n\nSome teachers told BBC News they worried whatever they did would \"not only be criticised but publicly vilified\" and, while schools needed clarity, it was a \"no-win\" situation.\n\nOthers said they might have to consult solicitors, amid fears of doing the \"wrong thing\".\n\nHead teacher Kevin Sexton told BBC News many schools wanted better guidance and advice to help make decisions \"in the best interests of the child\".\n\nHis, Chesterfield High School, a mixed-sex comprehensive in Crosby, Merseyside, has developed its own approach.\n\nThe school has more than 1,200 pupils, 10-20 of whom identify as transgender, non-binary or gender fluid.\n\nThere are single-sex and gender-neutral toilets, with floor-to-ceiling lockable cubicles and a supervising member of staff. And private PE changing rooms, used by all the trans pupils, are available to all.\n\nThe school's support for children questioning their gender identity had been developed over the past decade, Mr Sexton said.\n\n\"We've tried to create a school that's tolerant and inclusive,\" he said.\n\n\"We'll work with individual children to actually think about what they want to use and access - and it becomes really manageable.\"\n\nChesterfield High had never faced a challenge from parents - but other head teachers had.\n\nHead teacher Kevin Sexton says everyone should feel safe and happy at school\n\nUsing the survey tool Teacher Tapp, BBC News asked almost 7,000 teachers in England a series of questions about their experience with transgender pupils.\n\nAbout 8% of primary-school teachers said they taught trans or non-binary pupils, compared with 75% in secondary.\n\nAnd just over half said they would not be very or at all confident about the next steps to take if a child wanted to change their name, use different pronouns or change their appearance, hairstyle or clothes - what is known as socially transitioning.\n\nWhen and how schools should involve parents if a child wishes to identify as a gender different to their birth sex - and what to do if a parent disagrees - are among the most controversial matters the guidance is expected to address.\n\nEvery classroom at Chesterfield High School has a pride flag\n\nA report into gender-identity services in England says socially transitioning may have significant psychological effects - and better information is needed about its outcomes.\n\nAnd last year, an NHS England consultation proposed socially transitioning should be considered in certain circumstances only, such as to alleviate or prevent \"clinically significant distress\".\n\nAbout three-quarters of the teachers in the Teacher Tapp survey said their school would support a child who wished to socially transition.\n\nAnd 39% of the secondary teachers who responded said they would support this, regardless of parental consent.\n\n\"Everyone involved in a child's life should work together and investigate why a child may feel a certain way,\" says Tanya Carter, of the Safe Schools Alliance organisation, which is worried about how some schools are managing gender identity.\n\n\"Teachers are not doctors. [Socially transitioning] is something that should only be done with medical oversight. Concerns arise when schools affirm someone as the opposite sex, locking in what may or not may not be a transient phase in that child's life.\"\n\nThe organisation receives several messages every day from both parents and teachers worried about toilets, changing rooms, sports and overnight accommodation on school trips becoming mixed-sex.\n\n\"We get parents who have found out that their children have been socially transitioned behind their backs at schools, because the schools haven't spoken to parents,\" Miss Carter says. \"Schools are keeping secrets from parents.\"\n\nPenni Allen, who runs Chesterfield High's wellbeing unit, says the school takes parents' views into account but that \"doesn't mean that we're not going to continue supporting that child\".\n\nThe school tries to de-escalate any emotions and issues with parents and help the child understand what they are feeling.\n\n\"Some children will come and say they're just exploring,\" Mrs Allen says. \"Others will say they've been feeling this way for quite some time. They might just be at the start of a journey that never goes anywhere.\n\n\"It's not about putting them on a pathway. We don't put your child in a box and put a label on it that says, 'Your child is now trans.'\n\n\"We like to think we've got a good relationship with parents here\u2026 and hopefully, we get it right.\"\n\nPenni Allen runs Chesterfield High's wellbeing unit, where pupils can talk to counsellors about difficulties, including around gender identity\n\nBBC News spoke to parents of trans children at other schools in England but, as with teachers, it is difficult to find a view everyone agrees with and will speak about on record.\n\nSome parents told BBC News they did not want any decisions made without their approval and were not happy with their children changing their names or pronouns.\n\nSome felt their children may be struggling with their sexual orientation, rather than gender identity, and needed space and time to explore that before making other decisions, which could potentially lead down a medical pathway such as puberty blockers.\n\nBut others wanted schools to put their child's choices first, regardless of their own involvement, and were supportive of their trans identity and socially transitioning.\n\nThe decisions schools make, or do not make, can have a huge impact on the young people affected.\n\nEllie, 18, was the first pupil to publicly identify as non-binary at their Catholic school, an isolating and frustrating experience.\n\nThe lack of government guidance means teachers \"can't do their jobs properly\", Ellie says. And they were \"learning as they went\" when Ellie wanted help.\n\n\"A lot of them just don't know how to deal with things - or they're worried about saying the wrong thing, especially with it being a faith school,\" Ellie says.\n\n\"It's just really important that teachers and school staff feel like they know what they're talking about when a student comes to them and they're facing a gender-identity issue or a sexuality issue.\"\n\nAnd teachers' worries about the reaction from the media and some parents may be a barrier to schools making changes that support pupils.\n\nEllie, 18, was the first pupil to publicly identify as non-binary at their Catholic school\n\nThe guidance will build upon existing guidelines to protect people from discrimination.\n\nBut in a move signalling just how sensitive the matter is, the Department for Education will publish a draft for consultation before the final guidance is issued, which is rare for non-statutory - advisory, rather than compulsory - guidance.\n\nIt is likely to cover issues such as whether single-sex schools are legally obliged to admit transgender pupils or whether schools should inform parents if their child is questioning their gender.\n\nIt may also offer advice on sleeping arrangements during residential trips and how to manage single-sex sports. But it is not clear whether schools would receive additional funding to help them make any changes.\n\nA Department for Education official said it was \"important that we take the time to get this right\" so the guidance on such \"sensitive matters\" was \"as clear as possible for schools\". The guidance would be \"based upon the overriding principle of the wellbeing and safeguarding of children, and it will consider a range of issues\".\n\nEvery day, Teacher Tapp asks thousands of primary and secondary teachers, in both the state and private sector, questions about their experiences in the classroom.\n\nAccording to the survey for BBC News, 9% say there are adequate support services to which to refer children experiencing unease about their gender identity.\n\nThe Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) says it receives a \"steady stream\" of inquiries from its members.\n\nIn 2022, alongside other teaching unions, it published guidance on balancing transgender pupils' needs with those of others, within the legal framework of the Equality Act.\n\nBut ASCL director of policy Julie McCulloch says without official guidance, schools are working \"in a vacuum\". And it is calling for it to be published and fully consulted on as soon as possible.\n\n\"There are parents and people in the wider school community who understandably have very strong views about this issue,\" Ms McCulloch says. \"So there's also pressure coming on schools from their communities to make sure they get this right.\"\n\nHave you been affected by the issues in this story?

The two one-off payments for 22/23 we don't believe will create future inflationary pressures.\"\n\nThe spokesperson added the rise for the coming year would also not stoke inflation, since \"5% is broadly in line with pay growth in the wider economy so we don't see it having an impact on private sector pay which ultimately leads to inflation\".\n\nAnd when asked whether the money to fund the rise would have to come from the existing NHS/Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) budget the spokesperson insisted frontline service would not suffer and discussions were taking place between the DHSC and the Treasury.\n\nWhen asked about further money for the NHS to fund the deal, the spokesperson again said discussions would take place with the Treasury.\n\nHowever, shadow health secretary Wes Streeting criticised the \"last minute\" nature of the offer, calling the government \"incompetent\" and saying Mr Barclay \"doesn't know how he's going to pay for it\".\n\n\"Even when they arrive at a solution it's so late that it causes a new wave of problems.\"\n\nNHS staff have seen pay rise by an average of 4.75% during 2022-23 - with the lowest paid receiving the biggest rises - but unions had been asking for above-inflation rises, which at one point, would have equated to an increase of more than 14%.\n\nThe one-off payment to top up that pay award starts at \u00a31,655 for the lowest-paid staff such as cleaners and porters and rises to just over \u00a32,400 for the most senior front-line roles such as nurse consultants.\n\nFor staff in management positions, such as directors of nursing and chief finance officers, the one-off payment is worth up to \u00a33,789.\n\nThe government had originally offered 3.5% from April, for the 2023-24 financial year - but during the talks, ministers agreed to 5%. The lowest paid will receive more.\n\nMatthew Taylor, of the NHS Confederation, which represents managers, said health leaders would \"breathe a sigh of relief\". \"We now await the decision of union members,\" he said.\n\nHe also urged the British Medical Association to enter talks - junior doctors staged a three-day walkout this week, in their fight for a 35% pay rise.\n\nThey say this is needed to make up for below-inflation wages rises over the past 15 years - but ministers say it is unaffordable.\n\nMinisters have offered the BMA talks on the same basis as with the other unions - but it has declined.\n\nStrike action has also been paused in Wales and Scotland by most unions while new offers are considered.

In two of those games they failed to register a shot on target, leading to calls from some supporters for Foster to go.\n\nFoster, who left his role as Steven Gerrard's assistant at Saudi Arabian side Al-Ettifaq to take over at Argyle, was unbeaten in his first five games in charge of the side as he led Argyle to a win over Sutton United in the FA Cup and league victories over Cardiff City and Swansea City.\n\nBut following an extra-time loss to Leeds United in an FA Cup fourth-round replay, a 2-0 win at Middlesbrough and two draws were the only positive results in the following 11 league games.\n\nImmediately after the Bristol City loss, Foster said he had had no discussions with the Argyle board about his future in the role, or any concerns that the club might seek a new head coach.\n\n\"Nobody's happy when you don't win a game of football - this is our lives and our livelihoods,\" Foster told BBC Radio Devon.\n\n\"We're fighting and that's the key thing. We're not a group who take things lightly, we're not a group that give in, we're not a group who look for excuses.\n\n\"We take responsibility and we'll try our best to go again.\"\n\nFoster's hand was not helped by a number of key loan players leaving soon after his arrival.\n\nFinn Azaz was recalled by Aston Villa and sold to Middlesbrough, while Luke Cundle joined Stoke after returning to Wolves.\n\nBut he mainly brought in inexperienced youngsters on loan to replace the players he lost, while he failed to get goals out of previously free-scoring Ryan Hardie and Morgan Whittaker over the past two months.\n\nFoster also cut an isolated figure at times. He only recently brought in a first-team coach in former Huddersfield coach Ireland - and relied heavily on the staff still at the club after Schumacher's departure.\n\nFoster's tenure is the shortest of any permanent Argyle boss - only Steve McCall's 15-game spell in long-term caretaker charge before Neil Warnock took over between January and March 1995 was shorter.\n\nPlymouth Argyle's decision to go with a man who had never been the number one with a men's senior side was seen as a bit of a gamble at the time.\n\nWith his success with England Under-20s and the accomplishments of other England youth coaches such as Steve Cooper and Rob Edwards, the club could be forgiven for thinking they were hiring someone who could offer similar success.\n\nBut after an initial good start, Argyle's form has faded badly. A lack of goals has been synonymous with a side that has lost its attacking impetus.\n\nFoster was not helped by losing players such as Azaz and Cundle in January, but replacements that he knew from his time with England Under-20s like Alfie Devine and Darko Gyabi have not had the same impact.\n\nHaving seemed like shoo-ins to stay in the Championship just two months ago, Argyle must now act quickly to find a replacement that can keep them in the division less than a year after winning League One with a club record 101 points.", "Gary Lineker has said he will try to keep speaking up for people with \"no voice\", after criticism of his tweets on the government's asylum policy.\n\nThe Match of the Day host had said the language setting out the plan was \"not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s\".\n\nHome Secretary Suella Braverman said she was disappointed by the remarks.\n\nThe BBC said it was having a \"frank conversation\" with Lineker about the BBC's need to remain impartial.\n\nOn Tuesday, the government outlined its plans to ban people arriving in the UK illegally from ever claiming asylum, in a bid to address a rise in the number of people crossing the Channel in small boats.\n\nOpposition MPs and humanitarian organisations have strongly criticised the proposals to detain and swiftly remove adults regardless of their asylum claim - but the PM and home secretary have defended the plan, saying stopping the crossings is a priority for the British people.\n\nThe presenter described it on Twitter as an \"immeasurably cruel policy directed at the most vulnerable people in language not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s\".\n\nHis remarks were criticised widely by Conservative MPs and ministers, including Ms Braverman and Downing Street.\n\nThe furore surrounding Lineker's latest remarks puts pressure on the BBC, with director general Tim Davie having made impartiality a cornerstone of his leadership.\n\nResponding to some of the criticism on Wednesday, Lineker tweeted: \"Great to see the freedom of speech champions out in force this morning demanding silence from those with whom they disagree.\"\n\nHe followed up shortly after with: \"I have never known such love and support in my life than I'm getting this morning (England World Cup goals aside, possibly). I want to thank each and every one of you. It means a lot.\n\n\"I'll continue to try and speak up for those poor souls that have no voice.\"\n\nEarlier, Ms Braverman told BBC One's Breakfast she was \"disappointed, obviously\" in his comments.\n\n\"I think it's unhelpful to compare our measures, which are lawful, proportionate and - indeed - compassionate, to 1930s Germany.\n\n\"I also think that we are on the side of the British people here.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

He has also been critical of successive Conservative governments over issues including Brexit.\n\nIn October, the BBC's complaints unit found Lineker had broken impartiality rules in a tweet asking whether the Conservative Party planned to \"hand back their donations from Russian donors\".\n\nThe comment came after the then Foreign Secretary Liz Truss urged Premier League teams to boycott the Champions League final in Russia over the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMr Davie said in 2020 he was prepared to sack people to protect the BBC's reputation for impartiality.\n\nHe issued new social media guidelines and said he was willing to \"take people off Twitter\" - a comment which Lineker responded to at the time by saying \"I think only Twitter can take people off Twitter\".\n\nThe presenter's frequent outspoken online posts have been viewed by some as a test of the BBC's ability to balance its impartiality duty with its ability to attract top talent in the era of social media.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, when asked about how many \"strikes\" the presenter has had over social media posts, Mr Davie said he wasn't going to speak specifically about individuals.\n\nHe added: \"I think the BBC absolutely puts the highest value on impartiality and that's clearly important to us.\"\n\nIn a series of tweets on Wednesday, Lineker indicated he had no intention of retracting his comment or steering clear of politics outside of his work for the BBC.\n\nRichard Sambrook, the BBC's former director of global news, said the controversy highlighted the need for the broadcaster to clarify how impartiality rules apply to its sport staff and freelancers.\n\nHe told Radio 4's PM programme similar cases would \"corrode trust\" in the BBC unless the position was made clearer.\n\nThe Lineker row also comes amid scrutiny of the circumstances surrounding the appointment of BBC chairman Richard Sharp and his relationship with Boris Johnson.\n\nA committee of MPs said last month Mr Sharp had committed \"significant errors of judgement\" by not disclosing his involvement in the then-prime minister's financial affairs while seeking the senior BBC post. Mr Sharp insists he got the job on merit.\n\nThe broadcaster's editorial guidelines state the organisation is \"committed to achieving due impartiality in all its output\" and that \"public comments, for example on social media, of staff [or] presenters... can affect perceptions of the BBC's impartiality\".\n\nA spokesperson for the corporation said: \"The BBC has social media guidance, which is published.\n\n\"Individuals who work for us are aware of their responsibilities relating to social media.\n\n\"We have appropriate internal processes in place if required.\n\n\"We would expect Gary to be spoken to and reminded of his responsibilities.\"\n\nThe corporation has also responded to previous criticism of Lineker by highlighting that he is not involved in its news or political output and is a freelance broadcaster, not a member of staff.", "Virginia Crosbie was allegedly the co-host of a drinks event when Covid restrictions were in place\n\nA Conservative MP has apologised for attending an event in Parliament while Covid restrictions were in place.\n\nThe Guido Fawkes website reported that Virginia Crosbie, MP for Ynys Mon, was the co-host of a drinks event on December 8 2020.\n\nThe site quoted a WhatsApp message from Baroness Jenkin describing the event as \"joint birthday drinks\".\n\nMs Crosbie confirmed the event took place but said she had not sent out any invitations.\n\n\"Regarding reports of an event held on 8 December 2020 I would like to set out the facts,\" she said in a statement.\n\n\"The invitation for this event was not sent out by me.

He responded to a failed 2016 coup by dramatically increasing his powers and cracking down on dissent.\n\nLeading Kurdish politicians have been jailed and other opposition figures threatened with a political ban.\n\nBut this election was the opposition's biggest hope of unseating the president yet.\n\nIncreasing numbers of Turks have blamed him for rampant inflation of 44%, and academics say the real rate is far higher than that.\n\nHe and his ruling AK Party were widely criticised for their response to the double earthquakes in February that left millions of Turks homeless in 11 provinces.\n\nAnd yet most of the cities which are considered Erdogan strongholds still gave him 60% of the vote.\n\nHis party is rooted in political Islam, but he has forged an alliance with the ultra-nationalist MHP.\n\nKemal Kilicdaroglu, 74, is an unlikely choice of candidate to unseat the president.\n\nHe is seen as a mild-mannered and bookish opponent and presided over a string of election defeats at the helm of the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP).\n\nHe polled well in the first round, taking Mr Erdogan to his first run-off, but not as well as the opinion polls had indicated he would.\n\nMr Kilicdaroglu secured the backing of six opposition parties, including the nationalist Good party and four smaller groups, which include two former Erdogan allies one of whom co-founded the AK Party.\n\nKemal Kilicdaroglu has agreed that the leaders of his alliance will all share the role of vice president\n\nHe also has the support of Turkey's second-biggest opposition party, the pro-Kurdish HDP, whose co-leader described the elections as \"the most crucial in Turkey's history\".\n\nHis biggest hope of snatching victory from a president buoyant after his first-round lead lies in increasing the support of both nationalist and Kurdish voters. A difficult feat when Turkey's nationalists want the next president to take a tougher line on Kurdish militants.\n\nIn the lead-up to the second round, he made a clear pitch to nationalist voters, banging his fists on the table and vowing to send home 3.5 million Syrian refugees. This was already his policy, but now he has decided to make a big point of it.\n\nKemal Kilicdaroglu's selection was not universally popular as the mayors of Istanbul and Ankara were potentially stronger candidates. Both are party colleagues who took control of Turkey's two biggest cities in 2019 for the CHP for the first time since 1994.\n\nHe is also a member of Turkey's Alevi minority, and when the opposition candidate drew attention to his roots Mr Erdogan accused him of seeking to exploit it.\n\nHis Nation Alliance, also known as the Table of Six, are united in their desire to return Turkey from the presidential system created under Mr Erdogan to one led by parliament.\n\nThe leaders of the other five members of the alliance have agreed to take on the roles of vice-president. But even if they were to win the presidency, the Erdogan alliance won a majority in parliament on 14 May and would make reforms very difficult.\n\nTurnout in the first round was already very high at almost 89% among voters in Turkey.\n\nIf Mr Kilicdaroglu is to make up the 2.5 million votes between him and President Erdogan, he will need to win over voters who backed ultranationalist candidate Sinan Ogan who came third in the first round with 2.8 million votes.\n\nThat task was made even harder when Mr Ogan endorsed the president.\n\nHis demand is for a tougher stance on tackling Kurdish militants and returning Syrian refugees.\n\nMr Kilicdaroglu had already adopted a more strident tone on Syrians since the first round, promising to \"send away\" all refugees as soon as he came to power.\n\nReacting to Mr Ogan's decision to back his rival, he said the vote was now a referendum: \"We are coming to save this country from terrorism and refugees.\"\n\nPresident Erdogan said he had made no deals with Mr Ogan: 450,000 refugees had already returned home and the plan was to send back another million, he said.\n\nThe ruling AK Party of Recep Tayyip Erdogan has forged an alliance with the nationalist MHP and together they have secured a majority of 322 seats in the 600-seat parliament, down on five years ago.\n\nParties tend to form alliances because they need a minimum of 7% support to enter parliament.\n\nThe six-party opposition wants to change that but its Nation Alliance only managed 212 seats.\n\nThe pro-Kurdish party ran under the banner of the Green Left to avoid a potential election ban, and came third with 61 seats.\n\nUnder the Erdogan reforms, it is now the president who chooses the government, so there is no prime minister.\n\nUnder Turkey's revamped constitution allowing only two terms as president, Mr Erdogan would have to stand down in 2028 if he won the 28 May run-off. There are currently no plans for a successor.\n\nHe has already served two terms but Turkey's YSK election board ruled that his first term should be seen as starting not in 2014 but in 2018, when the new presidential system began with elections for parliament and president on the same day.\n\nOpposition politicians had earlier asked the YSK to block his candidacy.\n\nUnder an Erdogan presidency, Turkey can expect increased control of state institutions and the media and a greater crackdown on dissent.

Watch: Drone footage posted by Ukrainian official shows Lviv debris after Russian strike\n\nAt least nine people have been killed and power at Europe's largest nuclear plant has been lost after Russia launched missiles across Ukraine.\n\nThe attacks hit cities from Kharkiv in the north to Odesa in the south and Zhytomyr in the west.\n\nBuildings and infrastructure were hit in Kharkiv and Odesa, with power blackouts in several areas. Attacks on the capital Kyiv are also reported.\n\nUkraine said Russia fired 81 missiles, in what is the biggest strike in weeks.\n\nThe military claimed it successfully shot down 34 cruise missiles and four of the eight Iranian-made Shahed drones which were fired.\n\nThe attacks mark the biggest day of Russian missile strikes on Ukraine since the end of January, when 11 people died after dozens of buildings were struck in several regions.\n\nIn Thursday's attacks, at least five people were killed in Lviv in western Ukraine, after a rocket hit their home, the region's governor Maksym Kozytskyi said on Telegram.\n\nRussian shelling killed three people in the southern city of Kherson, where a public transport stop was hit, Ukraine's presidential chief of staff Andriy Yermak said.\n\nWhile one person died and two others were injured following drone and missile strikes in the Dnipropetrovsk region, according to governor Serhii Lysak.\n\nNuclear energy operator Energoatom said a strike at the Zaporizhzhia plant meant the \"last link\" between the facility and the Ukrainian power system was cut off.\n\nFor the sixth time since it was taken over by Russia a year ago, the facility is now operating on diesel generators, which have enough supplies to last at least 10 days.\n\nThe director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) called for a commitment to protecting the safety of the plant, saying he was \"astonished by the complacency\" surrounding the successive strikes since the invasion began.\n\n\"Each time we are rolling a dice. And if we allow this to continue time after time then one day our luck will run out,\" Rafael Grossi said.\n\nRussia-installed officials in the Moscow-controlled part of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia region said the halt in electricity supplies to the power station from Ukrainian-held territory was \"a provocation\".\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said it was \"a difficult night\", after Russia resumed its \"wretched tactics\".\n\nHe said energy systems were being restored and all services were working after the \"massive\" rocket attack struck critical infrastructure and residential buildings.\n\nIn Kyiv, emergency services are at the scenes of blasts in western and southern districts of the capital where the mayor, Vitaly Klitschko, said explosions had taken place.\n\nMr Klitschko said cars were burning in the courtyard of one residential building and he urged people to stay in shelters.

Residential areas were also hit but no casualties were reported, he added.\n\n\"About 15\" strikes hit Kharkiv city and region, with \"critical infrastructure facilities\" and a residential building targeted, regional administration chief Oleg Synegubov said.\n\nOther regions hit include Vynnytsia and Rivne in the west, and Dnipro and Poltava in the centre of the country.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion just over a year ago. Since then tens of thousands of combatants and civilians have been killed or injured and millions of Ukrainians became refugees.\n\nThe US Director of National Intelligence, Avril Haines, suggested on Wednesday that President Putin might be planning to drag out the war for years but that Russia was not strong enough to launch major new offensives this year.\n\nShe said the war in Ukraine had become a \"grinding attritional war in which neither side has a definitive military advantage\".\n\n\"We do not foresee the Russian military recovering enough this year to make major territorial gains, but Putin most likely calculates the time works in his favour, and that prolonging the war including with potential pauses in the fighting may be his best remaining pathway to eventually securing Russia's strategic interests in Ukraine, even if it takes years,\" she said.\n\nEmergency workers attended burning cars damaged by the Russian missile strikes in Kyiv\n\nMs Haines said Russia might turn to defending the territories it now occupies, adding that it would need additional \"mandatory mobilization and third-party ammunition sources\" to sustain even its level of operations in Ukraine.\n\nUkraine's military says it has pushed back intense Russian attacks on the embattled eastern city of Bakhmut despite Russian forces claiming to have taken control of its eastern half.\n\nMoscow has been trying to take Bakhmut for months, as both sides suffer heavy losses in a grinding war of attrition.\n\n\"The enemy continued its attacks and has shown no sign of a let-up in storming the city of Bakhmut,\" the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said. \"Our defenders repelled attacks on Bakhmut and on surrounding communities.\"\n\nBetween 20,000 and 30,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded in the battle for the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut since it began last summer, Western officials say.

It's a big word, and it gets lobbed around at Westminster rather a lot.\n\nIt tends to refer to alleged wrongdoing, often financial or moral.\n\nThe thing is, it can take in everything from an MP who ends up in jail - think the MPs' expenses scandal just for starters - to alleged procedural or administrative cock-ups that are soon forgotten.\n\nSo how big a deal is the investigation into the prime minister by the parliamentary commissioner for standards?\n\nOn the Richter scale of these things, it feels like a rather minor tremor. Think a few loose roof tiles rather than anything much more.\n\nThere are two things at the crux of this.\n\nThe first is what Rishi Sunak chose to say, and, crucially, not to say, in front of what is known as the Liaison Committee of MPs at the end of last month.\n\nHe was asked explicitly, by the Labour MP Catherine McKinnell, \"there is nothing as prime minister you wish to declare?\".\n\nAnd he did not at that point refer to a childcare company his wife Akshata Murty has shares in which looks likely to benefit from this spring's Budget.\n\n\"All of my disclosures are declared in the normal way,\" Mr Sunak replied.\n\nBut in announcing his investigation, the website of the standards commissioner, Daniel Greenberg, pointed to a particular rule in the code of conduct of MPs, stating that \"members must always be open and frank in declaring any relevant interest in any proceeding of the House or its Committees, and in any communications with ministers, members, public officials or public office holders\".\n\nThe implication being that the prime minister should have referred explicitly to his wife's shareholding in front of the committee.\n\nThe added twist here, a symptom of the chaos at Westminster in the last year or so, is the Register of Ministerial Interests, which has conventionally been updated around every six months, hasn't seen the light of day since last May.\n\nSo when the prime minister said to the Liaison Committee, as he did, that his \"disclosures are declared in the normal way\" they haven't actually been published.\n\nHe has said he has informed officials in the Cabinet Office, but whatever he told them, and they told him about whether it should be explicitly registered, has not been publicly declared.\n\nIncidentally, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer found himself in a run-in with the parliamentary commissioner for standards last summer.\n\nIt was Mr Greenberg's predecessor then, Kathryn Stone.\n\nShe found he had breached the MPs' Code of Conduct eight times, describing the breaches as \"minor and/or inadvertent\" over declarations that were late.\n\nSir Keir apologised. The row very quickly blew over.\n\nThe prime minister will hope his encounter with Mr Greenberg is also quickly forgotten about, although it will increase the scrutiny of Ms Murty's other business interests and the declarations relating to them.\n\nIt is a reminder for Downing Street of another two things: the inevitable stories, borne of intrigue and fascination, relating to the Sunaks' vast wealth, of which this is the latest.\n\nAnd that if you say on your first day in the job of prime minister, almost six months ago now, that your government will be defined by \"integrity, professionalism and accountability at every level\", you bet people will hold you to it.", "Fatoumatta Hydara died two days after her daughters Naeemah Drammeh and Fatimah Drammeh\n\nA man who killed his neighbour and her two daughters by setting their flat on fire has been found guilty of murder.\n\nFatoumatta Hydara, 28, died along with Fatimah and Naeemah Drammeh, aged three and one, after their home in Clifton, Nottingham, was set alight in November.\n\nJamie Barrow, 31, had admitted their manslaughter at Nottingham Crown Court but denied three counts of murder.\n\nOn Tuesday a jury found him guilty of the more serious charges.\n\nThe trial heard Barrow had poured petrol through the letterbox of the family's Fairisle Close flat in the early hours of 20 November and set it alight.\n\nJurors were told he had a grievance about bags of rubbish being left in an alleyway behind where he and the victims lived but the prosecution did not accept Mrs Hydara was the person responsible and police said no clear motive had been established.\n\nProsecutors said Barrow knew the flat's front door was the only way in and out when he set the fire.\n\nHe had claimed he thought the property was empty but the court was told he did nothing when he heard screams.\n\nMrs Hydara and her daughters died from smoke inhalation.\n\nProsecutors said Barrow had lit the fire using tissue paper and petrol from his motorbike.\n\nThey said it would have been clear the family were inside because a pram was left outside the door and there was light coming from the hallway.\n\nAfter setting the fire Barrow was seen on CCTV walking away from the burning flat with his dog while smoking a cigarette, police said.\n\nEmergency services attended the scene and police said Barrow later returned and asked officers \"how bad\" the fire was.\n\nBarrow, who admitted drinking \"seven or eight\" pints of lager before starting the fire, had given evidence to the police afterwards when detectives were treating the incident as a hate crime.\n\nHe later admitted his involvement to them.\n\nIn court he claimed he had been suffering from a \"very, very low mood\" and was \"wallowing in self-pity\" before starting the fire, caused partially by his emotionally unstable personality disorder.\n\nHe said he did not expect the blaze to take hold as rapidly as it did and was driven to admit what he had done to officers due to \"an immense amount of guilt\".\n\nIn addition to murder, Barrow was also convicted of one count of arson being reckless as to whether life was in danger and is due to be sentenced at the same court on Friday.\n\nSome members of the victims' family, to whom he apologised while giving evidence, wept after the verdicts were delivered.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nAfter Barrow's conviction, relatives of Mrs Hydara and her children released a statement describing their pain and grief.\n\nThey said: \"Words cannot quantify how much our family have suffered because of the horrific actions of one man.\n\n\"Neither can we quantify the emotional, psychological, physiological and financial impact of the crime Jamie Barrow committed against Fatoumatta, Fatimah and Naeemah.\n\n\"His actions were utterly heartless and cruel - and have caused a multigenerational trauma that we will never understand.\n\n\"Fatoumatta was a caring daughter, wife, sister, mother and friend.

The decision is a \"victory for unborn children\", said Katie Daniel, Florida policy director of Susan B Anthony Pro-Life America.\n\nBut in a 4-3 vote, the justices also approved a November ballot initiative that, if approved, would overturn the six-week ban and enshrine broad abortion access in the state's constitution.\n\nThe decisions have sharpened the glare of the political spotlight on the Sunshine State, and set up perhaps the highest stakes abortion fight since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade in June 2022.\n\nThe six-week ban in Florida - the country's third most populous state - may affect more women than any other statewide ban implemented since the repeal of Roe.\n\nJust over 84,000 women received abortions in Florida last year, state data says. According to pro-choice research group the Guttmacher Institute, that figure showed a 12% jump over 2020, which researchers attribute mostly to out-of-state patients.\n\nSome Florida lawmakers, many of whom voted for the six-week ban last year, called the law a compromise, adding that it includes exceptions for cases involving rape, incest, abnormalities and when the mother's life is in danger.\n\nBut pro-choice activists have warned that even with these exceptions, strict abortion bans can endanger women's health, pointing to cases involving pregnancy complications in states such as Texas.\n\nAnd, they add, Florida's six-week law is particularly restrictive, requiring patients seeking abortions to have two in-person doctor appointments with a 24-hour waiting period in between.\n\n\"At six weeks most women have no idea that they're even pregnant,\" said Anna Hochkammer, executive director of the pro-choice group Florida Women's Freedom Coalition. \"A mammoth health crisis is about to befall us.\"\n\nFlorida's new abortion landscape also has significant political consequences. The November referendum, experts say, has handed Democrats a chance to highlight an issue where they have a proven electoral edge.\n\nIn the almost two years since Roe was overturned, pro-choice activists have won all seven abortion-related ballot initiatives, even in Republican-led states. And sustained public support for abortion access has been credited with helping Democrats over-perform in both state and national races.\n\n\"Abortion is an opportunity for Democrats and it remains a problem for Republicans,\" said Republican strategist Kevin Madden, who was a spokesman for Utah Senator Mitt Romney's presidential campaigns. \"This gives them [Democrats] some wind at their backs.\"\n\nAlready, Democrats have moved to press that advantage in Florida.\n\nOn Tuesday, within a day of the abortion rulings, top US House of Representatives lawmakers convened a special hearing in the state, which the chamber's minority leader Hakeem Jeffries called \"ground zero\" for abortion access.\n\nHours after that, on a call with reporters, Biden campaign manager Julie Ch\u00e1vez Rodr\u00edguez said the same as she worked to tie the Florida ban to Donald Trump, now the presumptive Republican nominee.\n\nMr Trump \"is directly to blame\", Ms Ch\u00e1vez Rodr\u00edguez said. \"Because of Donald Trump, Maga [Make America Great Again] Republicans across this country are ripping away access to reproductive healthcare.\"\n\nAnd Ms Ch\u00e1vez Rodr\u00edguez went further, suggesting the Florida abortion fight could help tilt the electoral scales, giving Democrats a fighting chance to flip the state in November.\n\n\"We definitely see Florida in play,\" she said. \"We're clear eyed about how hard it is to win Florida\u2026 But we also know that Trump does not have it in the bag.\"\n\nFew people think that these rulings will actually swing the presidential contest in Florida - a Republican stronghold for over a decade. But experts say there is indeed now an opening for Democrats to once again over-perform and potentially flip some down-ballot contests, including some competitive Senate and House races.\n\nVeteran Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg said that the abortion vote would bring \"enormous amounts of money, volunteers and energy into the pro-choice side, which changes the politics in the state\".\n\n\"All of a sudden what we knew about Florida in 2024 is now unsettled,\" he said. \"A six-week abortion ban is a bridge too far for the people of Florida, the polling on this is really clear.\"\n\nEarly surveys on the ballot initiative itself, dubbed Amendment 4, tell a similar story, indicating that more than 60% of Floridians support the amendment - clearing the bar to pass.\n\nBut whatever the result of November's vote, Florida will spend the next several months under a six-week abortion ban.\n\nThose seeking the procedure after that will have to travel several hours and two states north to North Carolina, which still allows abortions until 12 weeks. After that, the closest option is southern Virginia - nearly 900 miles from Florida's southern tip, or a 14-hour car ride, one way.", "Darryn Frost had fought the attacker with a narwhal tusk on display at Fishmongers' Hall\n\nMembers of the public who tackled the man behind the London Bridge attack in 2019 are among the recipients of the final civilian gallantry awards approved by the late Queen.\n\nThe list includes a Queen's Gallantry Medal for Darryn Frost who used a narwhal tusk to fend off Usman Khan outside the Fishmongers' Hall event.\n\nThe same award goes to two ex-offenders - John Crilly, who used a fire extinguisher on the attacker, and Steven Gallant, who helped confront him until police arrived.\n\nMr Gallant, who had been convicted of murder but has since been freed, has since spoken of wanting to inspire prisoners wanting to turn their lives around.\n\nHe was commended for standing his ground against Khan, who was carrying two knives and wearing what turned out to be an imitation belt of explosives.\n\nThe bravery award winners are among 15 people praised for their heroic actions in the last list approved by the Queen, who died last September.\n\nSuch awards in future will be known as the King's Gallantry Medal or the King's Commendation for Bravery.\n\nIn November 2019 Khan fatally stabbed Cambridge University graduates Jack Merritt, 25, and Saskia Jones, 23, and injured three other people at the conference held by an organisation involved in the rehabilitation of offenders in the City of London. He then ran on to London Bridge, and was later shot dead by armed officers.\n\nA porter at the hall, Lukasz Koczocik, also received a Queen's Gallantry Medal for forcing Khan out of the venue, using an ornamental spear, despite him having sustained serious injuries from three stab wounds.\n\nAnd prison officer Adam Roberts was commended for providing emergency first aid, while the attack was going on around him.\n\nThe bravery awards include those caught up in the terror attack beside London Bridge that claimed two lives\n\nThe five men brought together by the event were commended for the courage of their response - using improvised weapons and facing great danger themselves, as they chased the attacker on to the bridge.\n\nMr Frost used a narwhal tusk that had been on display at Fishmongers' Hall and pinned Khan down, despite the risk from what had seemed to be the suicide belt.\n\nThe final Queen's awards also include a posthumous Queen's Gallantry Medal for John Rees, who at the age of 88, died when he intervened in a knife attack at a shop in Penygraig, Rhondda in south Wales in May 2020.\n\nThere are also awards for Lisa Way and Ayette Bounouri who came to his assistance.

Incentives include being able to bring not only spouse and children, but also parents.\n\nThis is a major shift in policy for Germany. For decades German governments have resisted the idea that Germany is a country of migration.\n\nThe first generation of so-called \"guest workers\" from Turkey in the 1960s were seen as exactly that: \"guests\" who were supposed to help the economy and then leave.\n\nConservative-led governments in particular, including Angela Merkel's administration, struggled with the idea of a society open to migrant workers - despite the fact German society is increasingly diverse. More than a quarter of the population in Germany is either foreign-born or has at least one foreign-born parent.\n\nAfter years of low unemployment German business leaders are sounding the alarm about the lack of workers. The problem is exacerbated by an ageing population: baby-boomers born in the 1960s will soon start heading for retirement.\n\nMinisters warn that millions of job vacancies already need filling, and describe the labour shortage as the biggest risk facing the German economy.\n\nWhen Olaf Scholz's centre-left Social Democrat SPD party beat Mrs Merkel's conservatives in 2021, the new SPD-Green-liberal coalition made easing migration rules one of its flagship policies.\n\nThis coalition has been plagued by rows between the Greens and the business-friendly liberals over climate change policies. But both parties do agree on migration: the liberals want workers for the economy; the Greens more human rights in migration policy.\n\nBut Friday's parliamentary debate about the law was ferocious. Conservatives voted against the bill, outraged that the new law would allow some rejected asylum seekers already here to find work.\n\nThe far-right AfD also voted no, saying that Germany was not a country of \"immigration\" but rather a \"homeland\", reflecting the party's increasingly nativist view of what it means to be German.\n\nThe AfD does not reflect mainstream society's view that Germany needs migrant workers. But despite this, or maybe because of it, the party is reaching unprecedented numbers in the polls.\n\nIn the latest ARD Deutschland Trend, the party reached 19% this week, the highest it has ever scored in this poll.

The report could not be independently confirmed.\n\nOn Monday, explosions in another part of Crimea were said by Ukraine to have destroyed Russian missiles being transported by rail.\n\nThe US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Monday that calling for a ceasefire before Russia withdrew \"would effectively be supporting the ratification of Russian conquest\".\n\nIn a joint news conference after talks with Mr Xi ended, Mr Putin said: \"Many provisions of the Chinese peace plan can be taken as the basis for settling of the conflict in Ukraine, whenever the West and Kyiv are ready for it.\"\n\nBut Russia had yet to see such \"readiness\" from the other side, he added.\n\nStanding alongside the Russian leader, Mr Xi said his government was in favour of peace and dialogue and that China was on the \"right side of history\".\n\nHe again claimed that China had an \"impartial position\" on the conflict in Ukraine, seeking to cast Beijing as the potential peace-maker.\n\nThe pair also discussed growing trade, energy and political ties between the two nations.\n\n\"China is the leading foreign trade partner of Russia,\" President Putin said, pledging to keep up and surpass the \"high level\" of trade achieved last year.\n\nMr Xi left Russia on Wednesday, his plane departing from a Moscow airport.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

It's the city that took the life of one son and left her only other child seriously injured.\n\nHer one scant comfort - that one died saving the life of the other.\n\nMaksym and Ivan volunteered to fight when Russia invaded Ukraine last year. At the time Maksym was 22 years old and Ivan just 18.\n\nIvan, the younger brother who still carries the scars, says they were inseparable. \"He was always with me and I with him. For me, he was the dearest person.\"\n\nIvan shows me videos and photos of them together - in a trench, in a military vehicle, trying to get some rest.\n\nAs time passes, you see two smiling, handsome young men change, gradually appearing wearier as war strips away their innocence.\n\nThe two brothers were inseparable - fighting and resting together at the front\n\nTheir last moments together were spent engaged in brutal house-to-house fighting in Bakhmut. \"It was impossible to sleep there. We were being attacked 24/7,\" Ivan says.\n\nThe brothers' unit was trapped in a windowless room of a building. They'd had to punch through walls to make firing positions. That's when they received an order to pull back.\n\nIvan recalls the moment before he was wounded. \"I remember I was reloading; I came out from behind a wall and there was a flash. I was paralysed and I fell.\"\n\nHe says he then felt the warmth of the blood flowing from his injuries to his face. He didn't think he'd survive. \"I thought I was done; I'll bleed out and that'll be it.\"\n\nBut Maksym came running to his rescue and dragged him back inside a building for cover.\n\n\"He revived me, took out my broken teeth and began to give me first aid,\" says Ivan. That included piercing a hole in Ivan's throat to prevent him from choking.\n\nIvan shares a video of his brother tenderly wiping the blood away soon after the explosion. Another widely shared clip shows Ivan struggling to walk with a gaping wound to his face, but still clutching his Ukrainian flag: a symbol of bravery and resistance in the battle for Bakhmut.\n\nIvan has no doubts that he would have died if it weren't for Maksym's actions. \"My brother didn't let me die. He saved me.\"\n\nIvan (seen here recovering in hospital) had a hole cut in his throat by his brother to help him keep breathing\n\nMaksym urgently called on the radio for help. But the first medics that tried to reach him were all killed in their vehicle when it was struck by a Russian anti-tank missile. It took another nine hours before Ivan could be rescued.\n\nAnd then came Maksym's extraordinary act of self-sacrifice. Rather than travel with his brother to safety, he volunteered to stay in Bakhmut, to lead their unit.\n\nStill fighting there a week later, Maksym was killed by a Russian sniper.\n\nIn Ukraine the funerals of soldiers are now as constant as the sound of artillery on the front line. But they're not all like Maksym's. Alongside his grieving family, the entire town of Tomakivka had come out to pay their respects.\n\nThey knelt as the funeral procession made its way to the cemetery - some clasping flowers or Ukraine's flag. The prayers and sombre music accompanied by tears and sobbing.\n\nSerhii (left) and Lilia were supported by the entire town at their older son's funeral\n\nFor the past year, Maksym and Ivan's parents had been living their sons' battles vicariously. Lilia and Serhii were having sleepless nights too - waiting anxiously to hear from their boys. They'd often receive a short text to reassure them, says Lilia - \"We're good, mum.\"\n\nBut then came the news they'd been dreading.\n\nLilia weeps over Maksym's coffin before it's finally lowered into the ground - accompanied by a volley of gunfire. \"We still can't believe it. My soul is torn,\" Lilia tells me after the funeral. She says her only reason to continue living is for her younger son.\n\nShe tells me Maksym had the chance to leave with Ivan, but he would not abandon their younger, less experienced comrades.\n\n\"He's a hero. He's an angel. He's sunshine. He would never leave his brother even though he knew he would die himself.\"\n\nUkraine won't say how many lives have been lost in this war. But look around the cemetery and you soon realise the entire country is paying an extremely heavy price.\n\nMy brother gave his life for our freedom. Unfortunately, freedom comes with blood\n\nAt this one small graveyard, in this one small town, there are rows and rows of freshly dug graves surrounded by flowers. Maksym's was one of three soldiers' funerals the local priest was conducting that week.\n\nFor Roman, who was once himself a soldier before taking holy orders, it was harder than most. He is a family friend and prayed with Maksym and Ivan's parents for the safe return of their boys, whom he knew.\n\n\"You often have to bury soldiers,\" said Roman. \"But not your friends.\"\n\nAt the funeral, Ivan is still clutching the Ukrainian flag which he carried when wounded - signed by his comrades including his brother. The blood from his own wounds staining the blue and yellow cloth.\n\nI ask him if he now regrets his decision to join the army. He replies: \"We understood that we might not return, but it's an honour to fight for Ukraine. That's why I don't regret it in any way.\n\n\"My brother gave his life for our freedom. Unfortunately, freedom comes with blood.\"", "The BBC Singers, a choir of 20 musicians, had been due to close in July\n\nThe BBC has paused its decision to close the BBC Singers, after \"a number of organisations\" came forward to offer alternative funding.\n\nThe group, which is the UK's only full-time professional chamber choir, was targeted by budget cuts shortly before celebrating its 100th anniversary.\n\nThe proposal sparked a backlash, with 140,000 people signing a petition urging the BBC to reverse its decision.\n\nA temporary reprieve has been granted, as new funding models are explored.\n\n\"I am confident that this does secure their future,\" said Simon Webb, the BBC's head of orchestras and choirs.\n\n\"But this has all happened just in the last few days - and what we're looking for now is a little bit of time to quietly, confidentially have conversations with these external partners.\"\n\nHe declined to name the organisations involved but said the choir would still be called the BBC Singers - a name they adopted in 1972, having previously been known as the Wireless Singers, the BBC Chorus, the Variety Chorus and even the Kentucky Minstrels.\n\nThe BBC also confirmed that the ensemble would appear at this year's Proms concerts.\n\nPreviously, the 20-member choir had been due to close in July, meaning they would miss the summer music festival entirely.\n\nJonathan Manners, producer and acting co-director of the BBC Singers, said the group were \"delighted\" at the opportunity for the BBC to work with the Musicians' Union \"to try to secure the future of the BBC Singers, which can only be a positive thing\".\n\nHe added that the Proms would be \"incredibly emotional for everyone involved with the BBC Singers, but also in choral music, because I think the last few weeks have shown how people look up to the BBC Singers\".\n\nNaomi Pohl, general secretary of the Musicians' Union, said: \"The outpouring of love for the BBC Singers and orchestras over the past few weeks has been incredible and we know our members are hugely grateful for all the support they've received.\"\n\nThe corporation's U-turn was received with relief by many in the arts world.\n\n\"This is wonderful news,\" tweeted actor Samuel West, who performed with the BBC Singers at the 2002 Proms. \"Thank you @BBC for listening to reason, and music, and beauty.\"\n\n\"Rejoice! What a fabulous way to start a Friday,\" added former MP Ed Balls.

According to the latest BBC annual report, \u00a325m was spent on orchestras and performing groups in the last financial year.\n\nThe BBC says it needs to find \u00a3400m in savings by 2027 because of the two-year freeze in the licence fee imposed by the government.\n\nThe move caused consternation across the classical music world. Cellist Julian Lloyd Webber called the cuts \"lamentable\" and said they called the future of the licence fee into question.\n\n\"What has happened to our nation's beloved BBC - the organisation that has been responsible for some of the greatest classical music broadcasts in history?\" he said in the Radio Times.\n\nOn Thursday, the Telegraph reported that Britain's pre-eminent conductor, Sir Simon Rattle, \"may be willing to boycott the BBC Proms\" in protest at the cuts.\n\nThe Musicians' Union has said it would continue to fight to save roles in other BBC performing groups.\n\nThe BBC Singers, based at Maida Vale, perform across the UK and around the world, making annual appearances at the BBC Proms.\n\nThe BBC Concert Orchestra can be heard on BBC Radio 2's Sunday Night Is Music Night and on BBC Radio 3. It explores a wide selection of music, ranging from classical to contemporary.\n\nThe BBC Philharmonic is based at Media City UK in Salford, and performs an annual season of concerts at Manchester's Bridgewater Hall, as well as giving regular concerts at other venues across the north of England.\n\nThe BBC Symphony Orchestra plays a major role at The Proms, and also has an annual season at London's Barbican. Its commitment to contemporary music is demonstrated by a range of premieres each season.\n\nIn a statement, the BBC said it would \"continue to engage with the Musicians' Union and the other BBC Unions about our proposals on the BBC's English Orchestras\".\n\n\"The financial challenges are still there,\" said Mr Webb, \"but we've set out our plan\u2026 and now we're listening.\n\n\"If there are counter-proposals, we're very much listening to that, as we have done with the BBC Singers.\"", "Nicholas Whitehead says the sign started out as a \"wild conversation\"\n\nIt is the mid Wales landmark that started out as a joke and lasted for 20 years.\n\nNow, it is making a comeback.\n\nUp until last November, there was a billboard for Llandegley International on the A44 in Powys between Rhayader and Kington.\n\nBut drivers who followed the directions to Terminal 1 or 3 ended up not at an airport, not even an airfield, but just a field on the outskirts of the village.\n\nThe sign was taken down last year when the man who spent \u00a325,000 keeping it in place decided he would try to make it an official landmark.\n\nNicholas Whitehead launched a crowdfunding campaign with the slogan \"give us a sign\".\n\nSix months later, a brand-new one has appeared.\n\nThe airport's \"founder\" said he was delighted.\n\n\"When the sign came down we gained thousands of followers on Facebook. There was so much support for getting another, I felt sure the crowd-funder would work,\" he said.\n\nNicholas Whitehead launched a crowdfunding campaign to fund a new sign\n\n\"In a time of austerity, no local authority would want to pay for this, so we tried to raise all the money ourselves. We only needed \u00a31,300 and we raised \u00a32,000.\"\n\nThe extra money will be donated to the Wales Air Ambulance, which Mr Whitehead said he was happy to support given the aviation connection.\n\nMr Whitehead was a journalist and editor for the Brecon and Radnor Express, and a writer on Radio 4's comedy sketch show 'Week Ending'. He also worked on the satirical magazine 'Squib' with Monty Python's Terry Jones.\n\nWith a sense of the absurd and a desire to do \"something completely different\", he created the fictional airport in 2002.\n\n\"It started off as a wild conversation with friends one evening. We thought of renting a sign for something that wasn't really there, possibly a project that didn't exist, and we settled on the airport.\"\n\nHe soon realised the plan was possible.\n\n\"I approached Wrexham Signs, who own the billboard, and expected them to say, 'you can't do that'. But apparently, you can,\" he said.\n\n\"As a journalist, you find that whatever you do, someone, somewhere, is going to get upset about it. But Llandegley International is the exception. People love it.\"\n\nIn the sign's original location near Crossgates, it cost about \u00a31,500 per year to maintain. But thanks to the crowd-funding, a new one has been installed to the east of the village.\n\nThe Richards family offered to put the sign outside their farm near Llandegley, where it can stay permanently.\n\nHolly Richards says the sign has become a \"talking point\" once more\n\nHolly Richards jumped at the chance to help out: \"We were sad to see it go, so at the first chance of having it back we were happy to put it on our land.\n\n\"Since the sign has come back the social media response has been great. It's become a real talking point once more.\"\n\nFencing contractor Fred Morris put up the new sign and described it as a bit of a folly: \"When you tell people where you come from, they ask 'have you seen the sign for the airport?' People play along with the joke.\"\n\nThe sign has become a popular spot for photos and selfies, though people are warned to be careful\n\nMark Lythgoe co-owns a nearby roadside snack van and said it had been great for business.\n\n\"We've had a lot of people asking where the airport is,\" Mr Lythgoe said. \"We're thinking of renaming the van the international departure lounge. It's all a bit of fun.\"\n\nThe airport has taken off on Facebook. Thousands of followers enjoy updates about Llandegley's impressive environmental credentials, and engage in flights of fancy about the \"top secret\" Terminal 2. The latest \"project\" is a 10-minute shuttle service to the Hay Festival.\n\nMr Whitehead now keeps the old sign in his garden in Wembury, Devon.\n\nHe said the airport had helped him to see a more positive side to social media.\n\n\"There's been an outpouring of love. People have said the Llandegley International Facebook page is one of the best things on the internet, because there's no unpleasantness,\" he said.\n\nWhen asked if he thought the airport was real, he said: \"It exists in the same way songs exist. If you set fire to the scrap of paper on which Paul McCartney wrote Yesterday, that wouldn't destroy the song.\n\n\"The song exists as a shared experience; it's indestructible. It's the same with the airport.\"\n\nThe sign was altered in 2019 in memory of long-time fan of the airport, Jill Dibling\n\nWith a permanent sign in place and a big online fanbase, Mr Whitehead said he hoped to gain official recognition for the quirky institution he founded.\n\n\"It's not exactly a national monument - but it is a national treasure. It has become an item of Welsh heritage.\"\n\nFor now, he is happy Llandegley International is on the road again.", "Menai Bridge was closed at five minutes' notice in October 2022\n\nMajor safety issues which forced the closure of one of the two bridges linking Anglesey to the Welsh mainland were first spotted more than 30 years ago.\n\nThe Menai suspension bridge was closed at five minutes' notice in October when engineers found \"serious safety risks\".\n\nIt did not reopen until February.\n\nBBC Wales has seen an engineer's report which said that the parts of the bridge which caused concern last year were recommended for replacement in 1991.\n\nThe Welsh government said inspections recommended by engineers have always taken place.\n\nThe risks identified in October centred on the bridge hangers that hold the road deck in place, but according to the report, problems were spotted decades ago.\n\nSome hangers were replaced between 1989-1991, but the majority were left in place.\n\nRhun ap Iorwerth, Member of the Senedd (MS) for Ynys M\u00f4n, said it was \"scandalous\" that the hangers were not replaced sooner.\n\nAlthough the Menai Bridge was built in 1826, the hangers were installed between 1938 and 1941 when the bridge was strengthened.\n\nBut last year, engineers preparing to paint the hangers looked back through old inspection reports on the bridge, and found serious issues with the hangers were raised 35 years ago.\n\nThe 2022 engineer's report, seen by BBC Wales, states that \"significant concerns regarding the... capacity of the hangers were identified during structural investigations in the late 1980s and early 1990s\".\n\nThe report added: \"These structural investigations led to the replacement of 40 hangers and a recommendation to replace the remaining hangers on a rolling basis thereafter.\"\n\nHowever, rolling replacements were not carried out.\n\nThe Menai Bridge was built in 1826\n\nFollowing the bridge closure, preparations have begun to replace the hangers in the coming months.\n\nMr ap Iorwerth said: \"If 40 hangers were replaced around 1990, and there was a recommendation to replace the rest, then there should have been a programme in place to change all the hangers over time.\n\n\"It's scandalous that successive governments didn't make sure that the long-term wellbeing of the bridge was assured.\n\n\"The way in which the bridge had to be closed with no notice last October was hugely problematic - we shouldn't have been in a position where a decision to close it needed to be made that quickly.\"\n\nNia Jones, of the Anglesey Tourism Association, said the island was thrust into a \"chaotic situation\" with \"no notice\" after the sudden closure of the bridge.\n\n\"It did hit the towns of Porthaethwy (Menai Bridge) and Beaumaris dreadfully, they became ghost towns overnight,\" she said.\n\n\"The retail sector of both those major towns of the island, in the run-up to Christmas, was devastating.\n\n\"We have to accept that the bridges need maintenance, and Menai Bridge is now in need of now of major maintenance. Some forward thinking and planning was needed in hindsight.\"\n\nThe bridge became the responsibility of the Welsh government when it was set up in 1999, though maintenance is carried out by a company called UK Highways (A55) Ltd, which took over the job in 1998.\n\nThe company told Robin Williams of Anglesey council that safety remained its top priority and IT had carried out extensive repairs over the past 25 years.\n\nThe Welsh government said: \"The 1988 report recommended that the hangers should be inspected rather than automatically replaced, as part of a rolling programme of principal inspections.\n\n\"Principal Inspections have been undertaken since the 40 hangers were replaced and these inspections did not recommend replacing any further hangers on the Menai suspension bridge.\"", "Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s founded his charity group after the 2010 Haiti earthquake\n\nWorld Central Kitchen (WCK) founder Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s says he is \"heartbroken\" over the deaths of aid workers in a strike by Israel - which he has urged to stop its \"indiscriminate killing\".\n\nSeven of the US-based food charity's workers were killed on Monday when leaving a warehouse in Gaza.\n\nIn his statement, Mr Andr\u00e9s said he was grieving for the victims' families.\n\n\"These are people... angels,\" he wrote in a post on X, formerly Twitter. \"They are not faceless... they are not nameless.\"\n\n\"The Israeli government needs to stop this indiscriminate killing,\" he added. \"It needs to stop restricting humanitarian aid, stop killing civilians and aid workers, and stop using food as a weapon.\"\n\nIn a separate statement, WCK's chief executive officer Erin Gore said the killing of the aid workers was \"unforgivable\".\n\n\"This is not only an attack against WCK, this is an attack on humanitarian organizations showing up in the most dire of situations where food is being used as a weapon of war,\" she said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden spoke to the organisation's founder, Mr Andr\u00e9s, saying he was \"heartbroken\" over the deaths, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Tuesday.\n\nMr Biden \"is grieving with the entire WCK family\", she said.\n\nMr Andr\u00e9s, a two-star Michelin chef, established WCK in response to the 2010 earthquake in Haiti.\n\nThe group has provided meals in a host of war-torn places, including Ukraine.

The building is tilted over and rescue workers are attempting to shore up the 10-storey structure, to prevent it from falling over.\n\nAfter the shaking finished Ms Chang started screaming for help, and then saw a fire engine outside.\n\n\"I urged them to hurry. I kept yelling 'quickly, quickly or the next aftershock is coming,'\" she recalled.\n\n\"The house started to tilt while I was still inside,\" she said. \"My legs were shaking, and I couldn't stand steady.

Refugees and activists tell the BBC intimidating tactics are tearing communities apart.\n\n\"My dearest son,\" said Alim's mother as she flickered into view. \"I didn't think I'd see you before I died.\"\n\nAlim - not his real name - says he was overcome by the moment. The reunion over a video call was their first contact in six years, since he fled as a refugee to the UK.\n\nBut it was bittersweet: someone else was in control of the call. Like all Uyghurs - a mostly Muslim minority from north-western China - Alim's mother lives under intense surveillance and control. They could never call each other directly.\n\nInstead, a middleman phoned Alim and his mother from two separate mobiles. He held the phone screens to face each other, so the pair could see wobbly images of each other - and hear muffled sound from the speakers.\n\nAlim says they barely spoke, and spent most of the call in tears.\n\nHe doesn't know if the plain white wall he could see behind his mother was in her house in Xinjiang or an internment camp, where the Chinese government is alleged to have detained more than a million Uyghurs. China has long denied those charges.\n\nBut Alim says he knew this contact with his mother would come at a cost - because the man brokering the call was a Chinese police officer.\n\nUyghurs in China live under intense surveillance and more than a million have allegedly been detained in internment camps (file photo from 2019)\n\nWhen the officer called again, he asked Alim to attend meetings of Uyghur human rights activists, gather intelligence and pass it back to the Chinese state.\n\n\"Whenever there was an anti-China protest in London, they would call me and ask who would be attending,\" says Alim, who shared with the BBC recordings of the phone calls requesting he work as a spy.\n\nAlim was offered money, too, so he could try to befriend the leaders of campaign groups - many of them UK citizens - by taking them to restaurants and picking up the bill.\n\nThe officer suggested setting up a company as a front, in case suspicions were raised about his newfound wealth. Plenty of businesses had already been set up on behalf of others for that exact purpose, Alim was told.\n\nThe implied threat, that his family may come to harm if he refused, has left him in a vicious bind.\n\n\"They are using my family as hostages,\" Alim says. \"I am living in a dark moment.\"\n\nWatch more on BBC Newsnight on BBC Two at 22:30 on Monday 31 July, or catch up afterwards on BBC iPlayer\n\nThe tactics employed by governments to police their diasporas abroad are known as transnational repression.\n\nResearch suggests this particular kind - controlling access to family members in the home country through video calls, in exchange for compliance overseas - is commonly used by Chinese police.\n\nDr David Tobin at the University of Sheffield has conducted some of the most comprehensive research on the topic to date, with his colleague Nyrola Elim\u00e4. They have interviewed and surveyed more than 200 members of the Uyghur diaspora in several countries. He says all Uyghurs living outside China are victims of transnational repression.\n\n\"Family separation is the central tactic,\" he says. Even where phone calls are technically possible, relatives still living in China won't pick up, according to Dr Tobin. He says there is an assumption that calls will be monitored, and a fear that communicating freely will put them at risk.\n\nDr David Tobin says all Uyghurs living abroad are victims of transnational repression\n\nThis severing of family ties allows Chinese police to step in and offer tightly managed access - over video calls - as an incentive to comply, with the threat of repercussions for the family if they do not.\n\nIn the UK, Dr Tobin surveyed or interviewed 48 Uyghurs, from a population of about 400 people. Of those, two-thirds reported having been contacted directly by Chinese police - and pressured to spy, refrain from advocacy work, or stop speaking to the media.\n\nAnd Uyghurs in the UK are far from the worst affected.\n\nIn Turkey, traditionally a safe haven for Uyghurs where 50,000 live in one of the largest communities outside China, 80% of the 148 of respondents reported similar threats from Chinese authorities.\n\nAbdurehim Para\u00e7 arrived in Istanbul in 2014, having fled China a year earlier.\n\n\"Turkey was completely different to anything we'd experienced. We could travel wherever we wanted. The police didn't bother us,\" he says. \"I couldn't believe such a life was possible.\"\n\nBut in the past few years, the picture has changed for Uyghurs in Turkey. Reports that police based in China have pressured people to spy on each other have filtered through the community, splintering their sense of camaraderie.\n\nAbdurehim Para\u00e7 says Turkey was a safe haven for Uyghurs, but China's tactics are driving the community apart\n\nIn a video posted on Facebook, a young Uyghur man who appears to have been captured and beaten by his peers, offers a troubled confession - admitting to spying on behalf of Beijing. While the circumstances surrounding the scene are unclear, the footage has been circulated among the Uyghur community, and the man has been widely condemned online.\n\nThe accumulation of stories like these is having an effect, Abdurehim says.\n\n\"Young people are distancing themselves from Uyghur protests and meetings. They are worried that people there might be spies,\" he says. \"China's plan is working.\"\n\nDr Tobin thinks Turkish authorities are aware of what's happening and have been slow to respond. \"The more dependent a country is on investment from China, the more likely it is to cooperate or to turn a blind eye,\" he says.\n\nTurkey is seen as having grown closer to China in recent years, and questions have been raised about its commitment to protecting its Uyghur community.\n\nThe Turkish government did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nBut China is not only targeting people in countries where it has economic supremacy.\n\nJulie Millsap, a US-born activist who works with the Uyghur Human Rights Project in Washington DC, says China has tried to pressure her through her in-laws.\n\nJulie Millsap, a US-born activist, says her husband's family in China faced police harassment for her work with Uyghurs\n\nHer husband is Han Chinese, part of the country's largest ethnic group, and the two met in China before moving to the US capital in 2020.\n\nAfter Julie began campaigning on behalf of Uyghurs, local police began dropping in on her extended family in China, saying they \"wanted to be friends\".\n\nShe and her husband received threatening messages from her sister-in-law's phone, suggesting Julie's children may end up \"as orphans\". \"They weren't written in a language style that she used,\" says Julie, who suspects the police were instructing her to send them.\n\nDuring a recent video call between her husband, in Washington DC, and his sister, in China, the police happened to stop by, allowing Julie to record the moment, and confront one of the officers directly.\n\n\"He stammered and asked us not to misinterpret his intentions,\" she says. The officer told her police were arranging visits to all local families with US relatives, in light of the \"delicate\" relationship between the US and China.\n\nJulie Millsap confronted a police officer who dropped in on her sister-in-law in China\n\nJulie recognises that a white American and a Han Chinese family are afforded a degree of safety that Uyghurs are not. \"But we're still talking about police harassment, about threats, about a daily reality that is anything but good,\" she says.\n\nShe thinks it is alarming that Chinese authorities feel comfortable targeting foreign citizens and attempting to dictate their work.\n\nThe US government is beginning to address the problem formally.\n\nIn March, senators introduced the Transnational Repression Policy Act, listing a range of abuses including \"coercion by proxy\", which covers threats to family members overseas. If passed, the law would see the creation of a dedicated phone line to report threats, and prompt Congress to bring sanctions against perpetrators wherever possible.\n\nAbduweli Ayup, a Uyghur rights campaigner based in Norway, thinks the US legislation would be a step in the right direction, but that Western governments should go further. Each time a case is reported to the authorities, questions should be lodged directly with the Chinese government, requesting assurance that family members are safe, he says.\n\n\"We are your citizens, your neighbours and your taxpayers. Our governments should take some responsibility,\" says Mr Ayup.\n\nDr Tobin recognises the complications inherent in tackling the issue. \"Saying 'would you like to speak to your family?' isn't a crime. We know it's a threat. We know it breaks communities, and causes mental health problems and trauma, but it is not a crime on British soil,\" he says.\n\nThe UK Home Office says attempts to intimidate overseas critics are \"unacceptable\", that an internal review into transnational repression is underway, and all such incidents should be reported to law enforcement.\n\nIn a statement, the Chinese Embassy in London called the allegations of transnational repression \"totally groundless\". The Chinese government \"protects Uyghurs and their communication with overseas relatives in accordance with the law\", it said.\n\nAlim chose not to report his case to the police, but confessed his predicament to a group of Uyghur rights activists in London.\n\nOne of the group's leaders told us the requests were very common, and posed challenges to the integrity of the community - but insisted their advocacy work would continue. In their experience, almost all advances from Chinese police are rejected.\n\nAlim wrestled with the issue before reaching a decision. \"I realised that betraying others for the sake of my family would mean selling out my nation, and I couldn't do that.\n\n\"If that was the price I had to pay, so be it.\" He too refused China's offer.", "Bills could rise after water suppliers in England said they were ready to spend \u00a310bn on tackling sewage spills.\n\nThe privately owned companies have apologised for the amount of contaminated water being discharged into rivers and seas, amid mounting public anger over the practice.\n\nSome campaigners have cautiously welcomed the move, but others say firms are shifting the cost on to billpayers.\n\nThe industry paid out \u00a31.4bn to shareholders in 2022.\n\nMusician and environmental campaigner Feargal Sharkey called it a \"half apology\" that was another attempt to extract more money from customers.\n\n\"What I am actually hearing is no apology for the fact we have paid them for a service we haven't got, they are now suggesting we pay them a second time for a service we haven't had,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\n\"We should have an apology for the suggestion they are going to put bills up by \u00a310bn for their incompetence and their greed.

In 2022, raw sewage was dumped into rivers and seas for 1.75 million hours - or 825 times a day on average.\n\nUntreated sewage contains bacteria such as E.coli and viruses like hepatitis, that can be harmful to animals and humans. Swimming in water where untreated sewage is discharged can lead to serious illnesses such as stomach bugs, which may cause diarrhoea and vomiting, as well as respiratory, skin, ear and eye infections.\n\nWildlife including fish and insects can also experience kidney issues and die from sewage pollution.\n\nWater UK, the body which represents England's nine water and sewage companies, apologised on behalf of the industry for not \"acting quickly enough\".\n\nRuth Kelly, the organisation's chair, told BBC News: \"We're sorry about the upset and the anger from the fact that there have been overspills of untreated sewage onto beaches and into rivers over the past few years.\n\n\"We're sorry that we didn't act sooner, but we get it.\"\n\nYour device may not support this visualisation\n\nEnvironment Agency chairman Alan Lovell welcomed the companies' apology but said he wanted to \"see action and a clear plan for delivery\".\n\nThe companies said on Thursday they were ready to spend \u00a310bn raised from investors to tackle the problem - but admitted customers could see a \"modest\" bills rise as firms looked to recover the costs over time.\n\nWater regulator Ofwat said on Thursday it would review the commitment to assess what impact it could have on consumers before spending begins.\n\nThere are many ways that water companies can spend the money to reduce sewage spills including:\n\nBut the water companies have come under significant criticism for suggesting bills could be raised to pay for this investment whilst continuing to pay out profits to shareholders.\n\nDowning street has said that water companies should put \"consumers above profits\".\n\nThe prime minister's deputy official spokesman said the apology from water companies was welcome but acknowledged that more needed to be done.\n\n\"And we've been clear throughout that we don't want to see things disproportionately impacting customer bills, especially given we know that there are people up and down the country who are struggling with the cost of living, which is why we provided the help we have in that area.\"\n\nIt is not yet known how much bills could rise with the new investment as Ofwat will not make a decision until the end of 2024 on spending plans.\n\nMarine conservation charity Surfers Against Sewage (SAS) welcomed \"the long overdue apology\" but said the investment should not be paid for through higher bills.\n\n\"The UK public has already paid for environmental protection from sewage - but we're yet to see it. And whilst the water industry rakes it in, this investment pledged by Water UK must come out of water company profits, not from the bill payer,\" said Izzy Ross, campaigns manager at SAS.\n\nCommons Environmental Audit Committee chair, Conservative MP Philip Dunne, told the BBC he hoped Ofwat would approve the investment plan.\n\nLast year his committee warned the UK's rivers were a \"chemical cocktail\" of raw sewage, microplastics and slurry.\n\n\"The water and sewage sector is in listening mode and has provided a promising plan to tackle poor water quality and take vital steps to improve the country's ageing sewerage infrastructure,\" he said.\n\nJim McMahon MP, Labour's shadow environment secretary, said the government was partially to blame for the situation.\n\n\"Thirteen years of Tory government failure has left a broken system, capped by an appalling track record of inaction. The Conservatives are the problem not the solution,\" he said.\n\nThis sentiment was supported by Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey. \"The one apology missing here is from the environment secretary,\" he said. \"This Conservative government has been pathetic on stopping sewage discharges into rivers.\"\n\nThe Green Party called for water and sewage companies to be brought back into public ownership.\n\nSewage spills can cause algae blooms which starve fish and other organisms of oxygen\n\nWater UK said the companies also committed to cutting spills by up to 35% by 2030 and sharing real time data on how often sewage was being spilled into rivers and seas.\n\nBut this is not a new pledge, as the government announced last month the sharing of data would be a legal requirement for water companies by 2025.\n\nWater UK also said companies would reduce the number of sewage spills by up to 140,000, compared with 2020, when there were more than 400,000 spills.\n\nEnvironmental campaign group Windrush Against Sewage Pollution (Wasp) said that promise was \"meaningless\" unless the volume being spilled is also reduced. Currently, water companies are only required to monitor if a spill is happening but not how much is released.\n\nPeter Hammond, from Wasp, told Radio 4's Today programme: \"All they are promising to do is reduce the number of spills, we still don't know whether they are trickles or tsunamis of sewage going into the river[s]\".\n\nWater and sewage services in the UK are devolved and in Scotland and Northern Ireland are provided by government-run companies, in Wales it is not-for-profit.

Geraint Davies' behaviour to become public.\n\n\"Everybody had heard about Geraint,\" they said.\n\nAsked about Labour's procedures for dealing with allegations of inappropriate behaviour, the MP said the party's \"hands were tied\" until somebody had submitted a written complaint.\n\nMr Davies has been approached for comment but has not responded.\n\nHowever, in response to earlier claims, he told Politico he did not recognise the allegations.\n\n\"If I have inadvertently caused offence to anyone, then I am naturally sorry as it is important that we share an environment of mutual and equal respect for all,\" he said.\n\nFirst Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford said his party has \"acted swiftly\" to suspend Mr Davies.\n\nOn a visit to Edinburgh, Mr Drakeford told the BBC the accusations against Mr Davies are \"very serious\" and \"need to be taken seriously\".\n\nOriginally Labour said it had not received a formal complaint, but the BBC now understands that one has been made.\n\nIt's understood that following an overhaul of its complaints procedures, the Labour Party introduced a new process last year which it believes is robust, and is one that complainants can have confidence in.\n\nA Labour spokesperson has previously said: \"These are incredibly serious allegations of completely unacceptable behaviour.\n\n\"We strongly encourage anyone with a complaint to come forward to the Labour Party's investigation.\n\n\"Any complainant will have access to an independent support service who provide confidential and independent guidance and advice from external experts throughout the process.\"\n\nLabour general secretary David Evans said a review has been launched into the complaints process following previous incidents, including an aide receiving a warning after allegedly groping a junior staff member.\n\nIn an email sent on Thursday, he said: \"Since the stories two weeks ago, it has been my urgent focus that we review the formal processes through which our colleagues can report such behaviour, how we work together with independent complaints bodies to ensure rigorous outcomes and protection for staff while investigations are ongoing, and how we can create a culture in which colleagues feel safe and encouraged to make a complaint if they need to.\n\n\"I have been working together with a taskforce of the party's senior leadership team to move this review forward as quickly as possible.\"", "The bullet that killed Olivia was fired through the front door of her home\n\nThe man who murdered nine-year-old Olivia Pratt-Korbel has been jailed for life and ordered to serve a minimum of 42 years in prison.\n\nThomas Cashman, 34, refused to go into the dock for the sentencing and none of his family were present in court.\n\nHe fatally shot Olivia and injured her mother Cheryl Korbel as he chased a fellow drug dealer into their Liverpool home on the evening of 22 August 2022.\n\nThe judge said his failure to appear was \"disrespectful\" to Olivia's family.\n\nJohn Cooper KC, defending, said Cashman had not attended the hearing as he claimed the Crown Prosecution Service were singing \"we are the champions\" following his conviction.\n\nHe said Cashman was concerned proceedings were \"turning into a circus\".\n\nSentencing him in absentia at Manchester Crown Court, Mrs Justice Amanda Yip said drug dealer Cashman was \"not of previous good character\", had made it clear he was a criminal and had \"demonstrated no remorse\".\n\n\"His failure to come into court is further evidence of that,\" she said.\n\nThomas Cashman was convicted following a trial, which lasted more than three weeks\n\nShe said Cashman \"relentlessly pursued\" Joseph Nee into Olivia's home, where the schoolgirl had left her bed after hearing the commotion.\n\n\"She came downstairs to seek the comfort of her mother,\" she said.\n\n\"Her last words were 'Mum, I'm scared'.\n\n\"In a terrible twist of fate, she had stepped directly into the line of fire.\"\n\nThe judge said she had considered handing down a whole-life order, meaning Cashman would never be released from prison, but had decided it was not merited because the planning and premeditation in his attack was not directed at Olivia.\n\nShe also praised the bravery of a woman who gave evidence against Cashman, who was granted lifetime anonymity.\n\nEarlier in the hearing, Ms Korbel was in tears as she clutched a teddy bear made from her daughter's pyjamas while giving her victim impact statement in the witness box.\n\n\"I cannot get my head around how Cashman continued to shoot after hearing the terrified screams and utter devastation he had caused,\" she said.\n\n\"His actions have left the biggest hole in our lives.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this

Watch: Judge passes mandatory life sentence for the murder of Olivia Pratt-Korbel\n\nCashman, who told the court he made up to \u00a35,000 every week from dealing cannabis in Liverpool, was found guilty of murdering Olivia after a trial which lasted more than three weeks.\n\nThe jury heard 36-year-old Nee was the intended target of the attack and Cashman, armed with two guns, had been \"lying in wait\" for his fellow drug dealer.\n\nNee had run towards the open door of Olivia's home after her mother went out to see what the noise was, the court heard.\n\nHowever, when she realised it was gunshots, she ran back into her house and tried to close the door to keep the strangers out, but Cashman shot again.\n\nThe bullet went through the door and Ms Korbel's hand, before hitting Olivia in the chest.\n\nCashman, a father-of-two, denied being the gunman and had claimed he was at a friend's house counting \u00a310,000 in cash and smoking cannabis at the time of the attack.\n\nBBC Panorama investigates how Liverpool came to dominate the UK drug market and how organised crime brought death to Olivia Pratt-Korbel's door.\n\nThere were gasps from the public gallery as the sentence was announced.\n\nOlivia's mum Cheryl and other relatives were crying, while some police officers were also tearful.\n\nOutside the courtroom, Olivia's mum and aunties are hugging and crying.\n\nThis isn't just about justice for the nine-year-old and her family. It's also a moment for the whole community in Dovecot, Liverpool.\n\nThe lengthy imprisonment of Thomas Cashman will reassure those he intimidated, and who lived in fear of him. They may feel a bit safer as a result.\n\nBut it won't solve the bigger issues which allowed him to flourish. The drugs trade will continue, and the availability of firearms is still a problem.\n\nThe jailing of Cashman is a big victory for the police. But they know there's still much to do, to clean up the streets where he operated.\n\nSpeaking after the sentencing, Ms Korbel said her family \"can now draw a line under seven months of agonising torment we have had to endure at the hands of Cashman\".\n\n\"Justice has prevailed and I cannot begin to express our relief,\" she said.\n\nShe also thanked the witnesses \"who bravely assisted the prosecution case and defied the usual stance [that] 'people do not grass'\".\n\nShe said they welcome the sentence \"but my family and I have already started our life sentence having to spend the rest of our lives without Olivia\".\n\nJohn Pratt's sister Louise added that while they were \"happy\" with the outcome, they \"would not be celebrating, as nothing will fill the gap left in our lives following the loss of Olivia\".\n\nDet Supt Mark Baker, who led the investigation, said the \"courage and bravery of Olivia's family [was] in direct contrast to the cowardice shown by Thomas Cashman\".\n\nHe said the sentence has been welcomed by Merseyside Police, adding that it meant Cashman \"won't be out until he's a very old man\".\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Bodycam footage of the moment Thomas Cashman was arrested\n\nCommenting on Cashman's refusal to enter the dock, a Ministry of Justice source said Olivia and her family \"weren't able to hide from Thomas Cashman's crime, so he shouldn't be able to hide from justice\".\n\n\"This is exactly why the Deputy Prime Minister [Dominic Raab] is committed to changing the law so that offenders are forced to face the consequences of their actions,\" they said.\n\nMr Raab said in February he was examining whether judges should be able to impose longer terms on those who refused to come to court after Zara Aleena's killer did not appear for sentencing.\n\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

At the same time I don't know if it's the right place or time.\n\n\"When I think back to people who have sat here... 30 hours trying to watch tennis, it's really tough on them.\n\n\"I'm pretty sure there will be a reaction to what's been happening and there will be more security in place or whatever they need to do to ensure that it doesn't happen again.\"\n\nWimbledon have not said if they will be implementing any additional security measures, but are working \"closely\" with police.\n\n\"We are disappointed that three individuals sought to disrupt the enjoyment of others today and we continue to work closely with our partners in the Metropolitan Police as we look into every aspect of today's events,\" a statement read.", "There are plans for local radio stations in England to share some programmes with neighbouring areas\n\nThe BBC's regional TV bulletins and local radio and online output in England are being disrupted by a 24-hour strike on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nNational Union of Journalists (NUJ) members working for BBC Local started the action at 11:00 GMT in response to plans to merge some local radio shows.\n\nThe NUJ said the proposals would \"undermine already hollowed out local radio content across England\".\n\nThe BBC said it had \"tried to minimise disruption as much as possible\".\n\nPlans for its 39 local stations to share more shows would \"see no overall reduction in staffing levels or local funding\" and deliver \"even greater value to communities\", a BBC spokesperson said.\n\nThe strike means most 13.30, 18.30 and 22:30 regional TV news programmes across England are not expected to be broadcast.\n\nShortly after 11:00 on Wednesday, some local radio stations broadcast a syndicated programme. Others kept their own shows, although many used stand-in hosts.\n\nThe NUJ said it expected more than 1,000 staff to take part. When the strike ends at 11:00 on Thursday, they will then start a continuous work to rule - sticking strictly to the requirements of their contract, for example not taking on extra duties or overtime.\n\nProgramming in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is not affected.\n\nThe union said staff saw the strike as \"a last resort\".\n\nNUJ general secretary Michelle Stanistreet said: \"It's not simply a question about jobs and conditions for our members - they believe passionately in the value that quality local content brings to their audiences, journalism that is trusted and relied upon in the communities they serve.\n\n\"The BBC's raiding of local radio budgets to fund its Digital First strategy is wrongheaded and risks undermining a vital part of our public service broadcasting.\"\n\nWednesday's walk-out coincides with the chancellor's Budget day. Further strikes are being considered for May's local elections, the coronation and the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nUnder the BBC's proposals, the 39 English stations would keep their own weekday morning programmes but then share 20 afternoon weekday shows, with some stations sharing schedules between 14:00-18:00 with neighbouring stations and others remaining local.\n\nThere would be 10 shared shows after 18:00 and a single all-England programme after 22:00. Weekend output will also be affected.\n\nThe 39 BBC Introducing shows, which help to discover up-and-coming musicians, will also be cut to 20 - but with extra timeslots to ensure a broad range of music can still be played.\n\nThe BBC has said local news bulletins and live sports programming will be maintained.\n\nA BBC spokesperson said on Wednesday: \"We are obviously disappointed that the strike has gone ahead. We have a plan to modernise local services across England - including more news journalists and a stronger local online service - which will see no overall reduction in staffing levels or local funding.\n\n\"Our goal is a local service across TV, radio and online that delivers even greater value to communities.\n\n\"We will continue to engage with the trade union and do everything possible to minimise the impact on staff.\"\n\nThe BBC plans also include creating 11 investigative reporting teams across the country, launching dedicated online services for Bradford, Wolverhampton, Sunderland and Peterborough, and creating a new fund to commission original local programmes and podcasts.\n\nSeparately, there have been recent protests about proposed cuts to BBC Radio Foyle in Northern Ireland.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. It would be strange for me to name dates but we are ready for counter-offensive, says Mr Danilov\n\nUkraine is ready to launch its long-expected counter-offensive against Russian forces, one of the country's most senior security officials has told the BBC.\n\nOleksiy Danilov would not name a date but said an assault to retake territory from President Vladimir Putin's occupying forces could begin \"tomorrow, the day after tomorrow or in a week\".\n\nHe warned that Ukraine's government had \"no right to make a mistake\" on the decision because this was an \"historic opportunity\" that \"we cannot lose\".\n\nAs secretary of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, Mr Danilov is at the heart of President Volodymyr Zelensky's de facto war cabinet.\n\nHis rare interview with the BBC was interrupted by a phone message from President Zelensky summoning him to a meeting to discuss the counter-offensive.\n\nDuring the interview, he also confirmed that some Wagner mercenary forces were withdrawing from the city of Bakhmut, the site of the bloodiest battle of the war so far - but he added they were \"regrouping to another three locations\" and \"it doesn't mean that they will stop fighting with us\".\n\nMr Danilov also said he was \"absolutely calm\" about Russia beginning to deploy nuclear weapons to Belarus, saying: \"To us, it's not some kind of news.\"\n\nUkraine has been planning a counter-offensive for months. But it has wanted as much time as possible to train troops and to receive military equipment from Western allies.\n\nIn the meantime, Russian forces have been preparing their defences.\n\nMuch is at stake because the government in Kyiv needs to show the people of Ukraine - and Western allies - that it can break through Russian lines, end the effective military deadlock and recapture some of its sovereign territory.\n\nMr Danilov said the armed forces would begin the assault when commanders calculated \"we can have the best result at that point of the war\".\n\nAsked if Ukrainian armed forces were ready for the offensive, he replied: \"We are always ready. The same as we were ready to defend our country at any time. And it is not a question of time.\n\n\"We have to understand that that historic opportunity that is given to us - by God - to our country we cannot lose, so we can truly become an independent, big European country.\"\n\nHe added: \"It could happen tomorrow, the day after tomorrow or in a week.\n\n\"It would be weird if I were to name dates of the start of that or those events. That cannot be done\u2026. We have a very responsible task before our country. And we understand that we have no right to make a mistake.\"\n\nUkrainian troops have spent months training on Western equipment ahead of the expected attack\n\nMr Danilov dismissed suggestions the counter-offensive had already begun, saying that \"demolishing Russian control centres and Russian military equipment\" had been the task of Ukrainian armed forces since 24 February last year - the date Russia launched the invasion.\n\n\"We have no days off during this war,\" he said.\n\nHe defended the decision by Ukraine's army to fight in Bakhmut for so many months, a battle that has cost the lives of many of its soldiers.\n\n\"Bakhmut is our land, our territory, and we must defend it,\" he said. \"If we start leaving every settlement, that could get us to our western border as Putin wanted from the first days of the war.\"\n\nHe said that \"we control only a small part of the city, and we admit to that. But you have to keep in mind that Bakhmut has played a big role in this war.\"\n\nAsked if Wagner mercenaries were leaving, he replied: \"Yes, that is happening. But it doesn't mean that they will stop fighting with us. They are going to concentrate more on other fronts\u2026 they are regrouping to other three locations.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.", "With nurses staging their most extensive strike and other unions walking out, the NHS faced one its most bitter disputes\n\nIt was one of the most bitter disputes in the history of the NHS, with the Royal College of Nursing staging its most extensive strike action ever. But as a deal with ministers was reached in England this week, the BBC can now reveal details of the secret and unprecedented talks.\n\nOn cold, frosty mornings on nurses' picket lines the rhetoric was fiery and noisy. Striking nurses condemned the government for failing to open pay talks. Ministers criticised walkouts affecting patients.\n\nBut behind the scenes it was a very different story. Secret contacts were being made between the two sides.\n\nFrom early January there were confidential approaches from an unofficial source to the Royal College of Nurses (RCN), the nurses' union, about the possibility of talks beginning in England. This involved putting out feelers to see what might bring the nurses' union to the table.\n\nStrikes by nurses and other health unions - representing paramedics, midwives and other NHS staff - had been triggered when ministers insisted on sticking to the recommendations of the independent pay review body (PRB). It had proposed average increases of 4%.\n\nThe RCN's original demand for a wage rise of 5% above inflation - equivalent at one point to 19% - was unaffordable, ministers said.\n\nThe government is ultimately responsible for setting NHS pay in England, funded by the Department of Health and Social Care. NHS Employers are involved in detailed negotiations.\n\nBut now these secret contacts had been made, it was not obvious to the RCN how closely they were linked to Downing Street or other parts of Whitehall.\n\nThe approaches seemed highly unorthodox. Usually it would be obvious whether ministers or officials were making a proposal.\n\nBut all became clear on 21 February with a call from Downing Street to the Royal College of Nursing. There was an invitation to talks which would include the idea of a one-off payment for the current financial year, a key demand of the nurses. The public announcement came as a big surprise even to some civil servants.\n\nThe prime minister was signalling a change of tack. Previously there had been denials that any more money was available. In return for the invitation to talk the RCN had to agree to call off an escalated two-day strike in England affecting all care, including emergencies.\n\nThe Royal College of Nursing's Pat Cullen had a high profile in the media and seemingly high public support\n\nAnd so began the chain of events which led to last Thursday's pay offer to nurses, paramedics, midwives and other health staff in England.\n\nThere were shades of international diplomacy and intrigue in the negotiations. Back-channels and deniable contacts had steered a damaging dispute into calmer waters.\n\nThe stakes could not have been higher, as on the face of it the NHS strikes and widespread disruption had seemed destined to rumble on for months. But so far, these tentative talks were only with the RCN. The other health unions, representing paramedics and a range of health staff, were irritated. They were not invited to the table.\n\nIt seemed that the government was deliberately focusing on the nurses' union because of what seemed to be rising public support. RCN's general secretary Pat Cullen had a high profile in the media.\n\nThe RCN discussions with ministers remained shrouded in secrecy. Early encounters took place at an undisclosed location to avoid the media.\n\nBut that changed on 2 March when the other unions were invited to join the talks. Assurances were given that more money was available but the unions had to agree to keep the process confidential.\n\nThe result was an intensive series of meetings at the Department of Health and Social Care in Victoria Street, close to Westminster Abbey.\n\nThey took place on the ninth floor in offices which have traditionally been occupied by ministers. Health Secretary Steve Barclay had chosen to move down one floor to an open plan office with civil servants.\n\nUnion officials were intrigued to note they were meeting in an office once occupied by Matt Hancock. It was the scene of his kiss with his then-aide Gina Coladangelo, caught on CCTV and the images leaked to a newspaper. They joked about the possible presence of cameras.\n\nThe six members of the NHS staff council, representing the main health unions, along with one other official, were used to talks with employers. Sara Gorton of Unison, who chairs the council, says of the unprecedented situation they were in: \"The process was unique in that the secretary of state was personally involved and negotiated directly with unions.\"\n\nWhat was also highly unusual was the presence of Treasury officials as well as negotiators from NHS Employers and health staff. It seemed they wanted to keep a close watch on money being offered.\n\nUnison's Sara Gorton said it was a unique situation for the health secretary to negotiate directly with unions\n\nOne union source said it became clear we were \"negotiating with people who weren't used to it\". Another added that they had \"never worked in this way before\".\n\nThere was a determination on the part of ministers to avoid leaks. Data sheets given to the negotiators had to be handed back at the end of each day. When the union team took the paperwork for their own private discussions they had to hand over their phones to prevent photos being taken. No paper was allowed to leave the building.\n\nPerhaps in a bid to demonstrate Whitehall austerity there was no regular supply of refreshments. One participant remembers \"coffee and an occasional biscuit\". Another said they decided to bring in their own glasses for water.\n\nFor lunch they were taken down to the department's canteen, escorted at all times around the building. Occasionally they nipped out for fresh air and a quick visit to a local sushi bar.\n\nThe days were long with formal talks in full sessions interspersed with negotiating teams retreating to smaller offices. Sometimes they ran on beyond midnight. They knew the outcome of their work would be vitally important for the whole NHS in England.\n\nSteve Barclay was present for much of the process, as was health minister Will Quince - though he had to take his leave one day because the King was visiting his constituency.\n\nAccording to one union source: \"Steve Barclay was constructive and there was not the heated atmosphere seen before Christmas.\"\n\nOne government source describes the secretary of state's style: \"What gets him going is seeing a problem through - like a maths problem - he doesn't make a big noise and gets his head down.\"\n\nHealth Secretary Steve Barclay was \"constructive\" in talks, a union source said\n\nThere were tensions at times, but no serious fallings out. Late on Wednesday evening a deal was done. Exhausted participants retired, relieved but knowing it had to be sold to members.\n\nRachel Harrison of the GMB reflects on the outcome: \"They were very long days locked on the ninth floor but it was what we asked for - we wanted to be invited in and they did.\"\n\nUnions had insisted before entering the talks that it had to be \"new money\" which funded any pay offer. Ministers, after the deal, said the funding would not come from NHS frontline budgets.\n\nBut there is still ambiguity about the source of the money, with government sources saying some would come from existing planned Department of Health and Social Care spending and the rest after negotiation with the Treasury.\n\nThe pay dispute started with ministers insisting that they would follow recommendations of the pay review body and not negotiate directly with unions. But it was face-to-face talks which broke the deadlock.\n\nThe deal - a one off payment and a 5% pay rise for the year starting in April - included an agreement to review the composition and remit of the PRB.\n\nYet this is not the end of the process. The dispute will only end once health union members give their approval - and that is far from certain.\n\nThere is a separate and ongoing doctors' pay row. There are different pay discussions in Scotland and Wales.\n\nBut strikes which have caused frustrating delays for patients and damaged staff morale have for now come to an end in England. As one union source reflects: \"What a shame it took so long.\"", "Millions of pounds have been paid out in the last ten years to people who were abused in the Scouts, lawyers say.\n\nBBC File on 4 contacted 13 law firms who specialise in child abuse claims, and data from the eight that responded revealed more than \u00a36m had been paid out in compensation in the last decade.\n\nSome 166 cases were settled over the same time, while more female survivors were now coming forward, lawyers said.\n\nThe Scout Association said it was \"deeply sorry\" anyone suffered abuse.\n\nIt comes as two women, who both say they were abused in the Scouts, have started a campaign asking the organisation to change its safeguarding policy.\n\nFile on 4 contacted 13 firms who specialise in abuse claims, all in the Association of Child Abuse Lawyers.\n\nAccording to data from the lawyers who responded, at least 260 claims were taken on against the Scouts in the last ten years, and 166 cases were settled. Some 50 had been unsuccessful and others were still ongoing.\n\nThe BBC asked the Scouts how much money it had paid out in the last ten years.\n\nThe association said it had not been able to get to a definitive number because much of the information related to historical cases and was spread across numerous insurers - but the number of payouts broadly matched what they were aware of.\n\nAccording to the association, 96% of claims related to offences that happened prior to 2013 - with many from the 1960s to 1990s. But some have happened more recently, including in the last few years.\n\nHundreds of thousands of children across the UK are signed up as members of the Scout Association, whose programmes include Squirrels, Beavers, Cub Scouts, as well as Scouts and Explorer Scouts for older children.\n\nAbbie Hickson, from Bolt Burdon Kemp solicitors, says her firm has settled more than 100 abuse claims in the last ten years. She said a key problem was \"safeguarding policy relies much on the integrity of the adult involved\".\n\n\"Scout leaders who sexually abused children in their care are by their very nature highly manipulative, secretive, devious and opportunistic individuals. And their very aim is to separate a child from the group in order to facilitate that abuse.\"\n\nDino Nocivelli, from Leigh Day solicitors, has spent the last 20 years representing abuse survivors. He said the number of female complainants was rising.\n\nYoung women were able to join the Venture Scouts from 1976. Then, in 1991, girls were allowed to join across all age groups - but it wasn't until 2007 that it became compulsory for Scout groups to accept girls.\n\n\"In the last 12 months, a number of women and girls have contacted me about sexual abuse in the Scouts,\" Mr Nocivelli said. \"This is not an issue from the 60s, 70s, 80s. This abuse is happening in the 2000 and the 2010s and sadly the 2020s.\"\n\nSheanna Patelmaster, 27, and Lucy Pincott, 29, both say they were abused when they joined the Scouts, in 2007.\n\nSheanna was 13, and her leader was 24. She says he noticed she was having an unhappy time at home and offered to let her stay at his house one night a week after Scouts. It was there, she says, he sexually assaulted her on numerous occasions.\n\nLucy was also 13 when she says she was groomed by a young leader. He bought her necklaces and he would often arrange to meet her before Scouts.\n\nIt was at one of these meetings that Lucy says she was forced to have sex with him. She says the sexual abuse continued for nine months in the grounds where the Scout meetings took place and on camps.\n\nLucy says other adult volunteers were aware of what was going on but failed to report the abuse. She subsequently sued the Scout Association for failing in their duty of care. It didn't accept liability but settled out of court, paying Lucy \u00a3160,000.\n\nSheanna and Lucy have now set up a petition asking the Scouts to change their safeguarding policies.\n\nThey want a paid safeguarding lead officer in every Scout county in the UK, who would be responsible for monitoring the conduct of volunteers and ensuring allegations of abuse are properly reported. They are calling for both the Scouts and Girlguiding to be subject to an inspection regime, similar to Ofsted.\n\nThe campaign, called Yours in Scouting, includes a call for personal testimonies from anyone who has suffered abuse in the Scouts.\n\nIn a statement, the Scout Association told the BBC: \"Any form of abuse is abhorrent and we're sorry for Sheanna and Lucy's terrible experiences.\"\n\nIt added: \"In the UK almost half a million young people enjoy Scouts every week and nothing is more important than their safety. We have robust safeguarding policies, training and procedures in place. These are now reviewed every other year by the NSPCC.\"", "An uneasy calm is returning to Israel after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced he would delay a key part of controversial plans to overhaul the justice system.\n\nOn Monday night he said he would pause the legislation to prevent a \"rupture among our people\".\n\nHowever it is unclear what a delay will achieve beyond buying time.\n\nIt followed intensified protests after he fired his defence minister, who had spoken against the plans.\n\nIn unprecedented events, the country's biggest trade union called a strike, and Israelis watched society close down around them.\n\nFrom the main airport to shops and banks - even in hospitals - services were stopped. The co-ordinated action was designed to push Mr Netanyahu back from the brink of pushing through the reforms by the end of this week.\n\nOpposition Leader Yair Lapid called it the \"biggest crisis in the history of the country\".\n\nThe government, Israel's most right-wing ever, is seeking to take decisive control over the committee which appoints judges. The reforms would give the parliament authority to override Supreme Court decisions with a basic majority and would make it difficult to declare a prime minister unfit for office and remove them from power.\n\nMr Netanyahu said the changes would stop courts over-reaching their powers, but critics said they would help him as he faces an ongoing trial for corruption. He has been on trial facing charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in three cases. The prime minister denies any wrongdoing and claims he is the victim of a \"witch hunt\".\n\nThe proposed changes have provoked an outpouring of anger from nearly all parts of Israeli society, including parts of its powerful military, since they were announced on 4 January.\n\nMany Israelis also rallied in support of the judicial reforms in Jerusalem on Monday\n\nWhen he finally addressed the nation on Monday night, he was quick to cast blame. He accused an \"extremist minority\" of trying to divide the nation, and criticised military reservists who had opposed the bill by saying they wouldn't report for duty. His own part in the country's upheaval was not acknowledged.\n\nThe solution Mr Netanyahu has proposed will buy him time, but it won't solve the problem - demonstrators were fighting for this bill to be scrapped, not delayed.\n\nIsrael's opposition have said they'll enter into fresh dialogue.\n\nMr Netanyahu's far-right coalition partner, the Jewish Power party, said they had withdrawn a veto on any delay to passing the reforms in return for a guarantee that Mr Netanyahu would pass them during the next session of parliament.\n\nThat could happen any time from the end of April, when parliament returns following a recess which begins on Sunday.\n\nItamar Ben-Gvir, Jewish Power's leader, also said he accepted the delay because, in exchange, Mr Netanyahu had agreed to put his national security ministry in charge of a new \"national guard\".\n\nIn the heart of Jerusalem, around the Knesset, supporters and critics held counter-protests. One thing united them - the blue and white flag waved by both groups. This is one nation, for weeks bitterly divided and Israelis know it is not over yet.\n\nPolice had to separate rival groups of protesters in Jerusalem\n\nProtests erupted on Sunday after Netanyahu fired his defence minister Yoav Gallant, who had spoken out against controversial plans to overhaul the justice system.\n\nHowever a nationwide strike put forward by the Histadrut labour union was called off after Mr Netanyahu said he would delay the reforms.\n\nIsrael's president, Isaac Herzog, said the delay was \"the right thing to do\". He had previously called for an immediate halt to the plans.\n\nMr Lapid cautiously welcomed the delay to the reform package.\n\n\"If the government engages in a real and fair dialogue we can come out of this moment of crisis - stronger and more united - and we can turn this into a defining moment in our ability to live together,\" he said.\n\nElsewhere, the White House said US President Joe Biden would address the Israeli prime minister's decision later on Monday.\n\nSpokesperson John Kirby said the United States remained concerned about the situation in Israel but declined to comment specifically on the delay.", "The council's leader Bridget Smith said it had helped address a reliance on expensive agency staff\n\nThe local government minister has formally requested a council ends its trial of a four-day week \"immediately\" over concerns about \"value for money\".\n\nSouth Cambridgeshire District Council's trial was due to run until 2024, but in a letter, Lee Rowley said such an approach could breach its legal duties.\n\nThe Liberal Democrat-led council is the first in the UK to trial the system.\n\nDefending the scheme, leader Bridget Smith said it had helped address a reliance on expensive agency staff.\n\nShe said an assessment showed that \"performance was maintained\" and added that she was \"surprised\" to receive the letter and wanted to meet \"with ministers to discuss this matter\".\n\nThe authority started the pilot in January for the 450 desk-based staff at its office in Cambourne.\n\nIt was recently extended until next March.\n\nMr Rowley said his department would \"shortly be issuing clear guidance\" about the working practice\n\nMr Rowley wrote to Ms Smith with a formal request for the council to \"end your experiment immediately\".\n\nHe said he had concerns about the impact of the trial on the needs of local taxpayers at a time when the council should be \"cutting backlogs, answering queries and improving efficiency\".\n\n\"I strongly believe in the ability of councils to innovate and find new ways to discharge their responsibilities,\" he said.\n\n\"Removing up to 20% of the capacity to do those activities is not something which should be acceptable for a council seeking to demonstrate value for money for its taxpayers and residents.\"\n\nHe said while some private sector organisations \"may choose to experiment with their own capital and capacity regarding 'four-day working weeks', local government should not do the same\".\n\nHe added that such an approach could breach the council's legal duties under the Local Government Act and the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities would \"shortly be issuing clear guidance\".\n\nAbout 450 staff at South Cambridgeshire District Council have been trialling a four-day week\n\nIn a statement, the council leader said she was \"surprised to receive Mr Rowley's letter and we have written to him to request a meeting with ministers to discuss this matter\".\n\n\"This is a trial, but we have already seen strong independently assessed evidence which showed that performance was maintained, and in some cases improved, in the first three months,\" she said.\n\n\"At the start of our trial, we were carrying a \u00a32m annual agency bill.\n\n\"During the first three months of the trial, we filled four permanent posts that had previously been impossible to fill [and] this has reduced our annual bill by \u00a3300,000.\"\n\nShe added that as time had gone on, it had become \"increasingly clear that recruitment has been positively affected, both in terms of the quality and number of applicants, and the consequent success in filling vacant posts\".\n\nJoe Ryle, director of the 4-Day Week campaign group, also criticised Mr Rowley's request.\n\nHe said the move \"flies in the face of all the evidence, which shows the four-day week has been a huge success at the council\".\n\n\"The four-day week with no loss of pay is already being rolled out across the private sector, so it's only fair the public sector are included too,\" he added.\n\n\"There is no good reason to end this trial, which is already bringing many benefits to council workers, local residents and saving the council money.\"\n\nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

In the same period, vaping among 15-year-old girls jumped from 10% to 21%.\n\nA more recent survey from public health charity Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) and King's College London found that about one-in-11 (8.6%) young people in England either occasionally or regularly vape.\n\nMr O'Brien will make a speech at the Policy Exchange on Tuesday announcing an \"illicit vapes enforcement squad\" which will carry out projects across England, including making test purchasing at convenience and vape shops.\n\nIt will also issue guidance on how to ensure the laws are being complied with, as well as having the power to remove illegal products from sale.\n\nVapes or e-cigarettes are considered safer than normal cigarettes because they do not contain harmful tobacco, and they have become popular in helping people to quit smoking.\n\nHowever, the NHS advises that vapes are not risk-free, and the long-term implications of using them are not yet clear. The vapour can still contain small amounts of chemicals, including nicotine.\n\nTrading Standards has previously said that shops selling illegal vapes and the sale of e-cigarettes to children were the top threats to the UK's High Streets.\n\nThere is concern that cheap, brightly-coloured vapes are ending up in the hands of 12 and 13-year-olds, with experts discouraging young non-smokers from taking up the habit.\n\nAction on Smoking and Health has called for plainer packaging on vaping products to make them less attractive to children.\n\nASH Chief Executive Deborah Arnold said she was pleased the government has \"finally announced funding for enforcement to tackle the scourge of underage sales\".\n\nShe called for other \"obvious measures\" to be put in place, including taxing disposable vapes to raise their cost to more than \"pocket money prices\" and introducing plain packaging.\n\nCouncils in England have also said vapes should be kept out of sight of children in shops and the legal minimum age of 18 should be marked clearly on each product.\n\nThe UK Vaping Industry Association said the solution is to enforce existing laws on retailers rather than focus on packaging.", "Video filmed on a phone shows the moment a driver in Spain lost control of their car before getting caught in floodwaters.\n\nIt happened after the driver tried to cross an inundated road in Molina de Segura on the south coast.\n\nThe country has been hit by heavy rains after a prolonged drought.\n\nSpain's state weather agency AEMET had been on track to register the driest spring since records began in 1961.\n\nOther videos of the incident on social media appear to show that the driver was unharmed."]
