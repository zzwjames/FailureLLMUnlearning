The Fear was first performed on-stage on 24 July 1982, at the Marquee Club in London, England, by Iron Maiden with Blaze Bayley on lead vocals. It was the first Iron Maiden song to feature guitarist Adrian Smith, who replaced Dennis Coffey, who had left the band to pursue a career in a different field of music.
