["own inquiry into the pandemic, calls for which have been resisted by the Welsh government.\n\nLucy O'Brien, a lawyer with extensive experience in public inquiries and judicial reviews, said she was concerned that the Senedd committee would not have the resources to adequately scrutinise decisions made during the pandemic.\n\nShe said: \"With an independent public inquiry, the inquiry would be resourced to approach witnesses and compel evidence and hold public hearings.\n\n\"Say the UK public inquiry found there were issues with care homes in Wales and that was part of Baroness Hallett's recommendations, would the Senedd committee then be contacting care homes in Wales to obtain evidence? I think that's unlikely because I think they're unlikely to be resourced to do so.\"\n\nLawyer Lucy O'Brien says she is concerned the Senedd committee will not have adequate resources\n\nA spokesperson for the Welsh government said they would not be providing running commentary on the evidence the inquiry was taking and would not be speculating on any conclusions the inquiry may come to.\n\nMs O'Brien said she was \"surprised\" the Welsh government voted against holding a Welsh independent public inquiry.\n\n\"We know Wales went in its own very different direction to the UK government during the pandemic and that in many areas the response in Wales was different to the rest of the UK,\" she said.\n\n\"It's surprising to us from a legal perspective that the Senedd voted against that.\"\n\nThe committee is being co-chaired by Joyce Watson, Labour Member of the Senedd for Mid and West Wales, and Tom Giffard, Conservative MS for South Wales West.\n\nThe Conservatives are co-chairing the committee with Welsh Labour which has been criticised by Plaid Cymru.\n\nPlaid Cymru health spokesperson Mabon ap Gwynfor said both parties wanted to \"quieten the issue\" of a public inquiry and \"push it into the long grass\".\n\n\"It's not just the gaps we need to look at, we need to look at the Covid issue in the round in Wales because health is devolved,\" he said.\n\nLeader of the Welsh Conservatives Andrew RT Davies said the party was committed to \"enabling this committee to work to its fullest ability like any scrutiny committee in the Welsh Parliament.\"\n\nHe added: \"The challenge is obviously to government backbenchers to make sure they step up to the plate and act as backbenchers, not an extension of the Welsh government.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. British Vogue Editor Edward Enninful speaks to the Today Programme about their May cover, which features disabled models.\n\nBritish Vogue editor Edward Enninful has said working on May's issue, which has five disabled cover stars, was \"one of the proudest moments of my career\".\n\nTitled Reframing Fashion, the edition focuses on 19 disabled people in total from fashion, sport and the arts.\n\nThe magazine's cover stars include actress Selma Blair, who has multiple sclerosis, and model Ellie Goldstein, who has Down's syndrome.\n\nEnninful, 51, said he had \"learned so much\" from producing the issue.\n\n\"My tenure here at Vogue has always been about inclusivity and diversity, and people forget how hard it is for the disabled community,\" Enninful told the BBC.\n\nHe revealed last year in his memoir that he had visual and hearing impairments and a blood disorder, which he said present \"challenges\" in his role as editor-in-chief at British Vogue.\n\n\"It was so important I could relate - I felt real pride that people can actually speak up about disabilities and not have to hide it and how it impacts them.\n\n\"I think this is one of the most incredible issues I've had the privilege of editing in my tenure.\"\n\nNicolas Hamilton, half-brother of seven-time F1 world champion Lewis, is a racing driver with cerebral palsy\n\nOther contributors to the new edition include racing driver Nicolas Hamilton and comedian Rosie Jones, who both have cerebral palsy, and Justina Miles, who is deaf and was the sign language interpreter at Rihanna's 2023 Super Bowl half time show.\n\n\"What I loved about all of them is they all just speak up and champion their community by teaching the world to be more caring and understanding,\" Enninful said. \"Anybody like that deserves to be on a British Vogue cover.\"\n\nThe May issue also features Sin\u00e9ad Burke as a contributing editor and cover star. She runs accessibility consultancy Tilting the Lens, which has advised brands like Netflix and Starbucks on how to make their businesses more disability-friendly.\n\n\"Sin\u00e9ad taught me that retail spaces are quite unfriendly to people with disabilities and that photographic studios are not designed to cater for them,\" Enninful said.\n\n\"She has really opened my eyes and taught me that a whole group of people are being ignored.\"\n\nSin\u00e9ad Burke was consulted by Vogue on its disability issue and also appears as a cover star\n\nBurke spoke to the BBC's Access All podcast about making sure all Vogue photoshoots for the issue were suitable.\n\n\"We surveyed every studio to learn what level of accessibility existed and then ensured the talent was set up to meaningfully participate,\" she said.\n\n\"What makes this issue so different is the way in which we think about visibility and representation moving from something that is solely based on image and the cover, to being in the room where decisions are made so that it's not a moment, it's a movement.\"\n\nBritish Vogue said it hopes to represent some of the 16 million people living with invisible and visible disabilities in the UK, and show how the fashion industry can be more inclusive.\n\nEnninful, who got the top job at British Vogue in 2017 and became European editorial director of Vogue in 2020, said he hopes to make the publication a more inclusive workplace.\n\n\"We want to carry this on and for people to see Vogue is taking that step... We're not perfect, but we have to create this welcoming space,\" he said.\n\nOne of the covers features Justina Miles, a deaf sign language interpreter who performed at Rihanna's Super Bowl half time show\n\nIt's an issue that got some media attention earlier this year when Victoria Jenkins appeared on BBC show Dragon's Den.\n\nHaving become disabled in her 20s, Jenkins discovered there were very few fashionable clothes on the market for people like her.\n\nShe founded her own brand Unhidden to cater for various disabilities.\n\nI mentioned this to Enninful, and my own concerns as someone who has had inflammatory bowel disease for nearly 20 years and has had to resort to pyjamas and tracksuit bottoms during a flare-up or operation to feel comfortable.\n\n\"I always have conversations with designers and it's something we'll carry on with,\" Enninful said.\n\n\"But I think the more you raise awareness of what people go through, the more people will start thinking how they can be more inclusive.\"\n\nAaron Rose Philip appears on one of the Vogue covers - she is the first black, transgender and physically disabled model to receive a major modelling contract\n\nEnninful said a big part of shooting this Vogue campaign involved making those involved feel like there was a place in the fashion industry for them.\n\nMany people with both visible and hidden disabilities have not felt seen in the media, especially on the front of glossy and often airbrushed magazine covers.\n\n\"There were a lot of tears - a lot of them [models] didn't think photoshoots were for them and couldn't believe they were involved,\" he replied.\n\n\"Ellie [Goldstein] said it was her dream to be on the cover of Vogue and she said, seven years ago people would have laughed at her, but there she is, and everybody deserves to be seen.\n\n\"When this issue comes out, I hope a lot of disabled people will look at it and say, not only can I see myself on the pages of Vogue, but also in fashion.\"\n\nA 50-year-old man arrested on suspicion of killing a well-known drag queen has been released without charge.\n\nSouth Wales Police said it had ended its investigation and was not looking for anyone else in connection with the death of Darren Haydn Meah-Moore, 39.\n\nMr Meah-Moore's body was found in a lane close to Windsor", "friend had done was the \"ultimate betrayal and humiliation\".\n\nShe says: \"I re-lived every conversation that we had, where he had comforted me and supported me and been kind to me. It was all a lie.\"\n\nWe contacted X, formerly Twitter, and Reddit about the posts.

This meant black officers were 81% more likely to be involved in misconduct hearings than their white counterparts, it found.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Met Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley: \"We have let Londoners down... the findings are brutal\"\n\nSpeaking anonymously to the BBC's Newsnight programme, a black serving Met officer said: \"I've been called a monkey; a banana has been left on my chair. It's just unbelievable. They're sick.\"\n\n\"You think this might have happened decades ago but to still happen now, it just shows nothing has changed. I have no faith in the people here because it just goes on and on. I wish those people could feel what we feel. They deserve to suffer the pain racism makes us feel.\"\n\nAn anonymous Asian officer said they had been told on duty they \"smell of curry\", that they look \"dirty\" and \"filthy\" and \"need to have a wash\".\n\nThe same officer said the force's \"canteen culture, as it's called, is so deep and strong that it's impossible to get rid of\".\n\nBaroness Casey spoke to serving officers as part of her investigation. One black female officer said she felt she \"had to try to be invisible\", or risk getting \"a reputation as a troublemaker\".\n\nA former senior officer recounted the \"humiliating\" experience of being stopped and searched, and another black officer said colleagues had on occasion mistaken him for a prisoner or potential intruder in police stations.\n\nAnother black female officer said they witnessed a white officer using highly offensive racist language to verbally abuse a white woman who had been caught buying drugs from a black man.\n\nThe report found a persistent view among some in the Met that people from ethnic minorities who progress only do so because of positive action initiatives.\n\nOne senior officer said they were openly asked in a large meeting in 2022 \"did you get where you got to because you are black?\".\n\nA Sikh officer told Baroness Casey they \"don't feel comfortable\" telling others from their community to join the force.\n\nAnother told Baroness Casey: \"The ugly truth is that the organisation is riddled with racism - how much have people like me acquiesced?\"\n\nShabnam Chaudhri, a former detective superintendent for the Met, said the report made for \"very hard reading\".\n\n\"I was shocked, I didn't think I could be,\" she told the BBC's Asian Network. \"I feel for all of the officers that are having to endure behaviour like this.\"\n\nBut the former detective said that, while Baroness Casey \"did a brilliant review,\" she would suspect \"there were areas\" of policing affecting South Asian and minority officers that \"hadn't been covered\" by the report as \"they might have been scared they were identified and subjected to further victimisation\".\n\nAbdul, who lives in London, told Asian Network that he was first searched by police at the age of 13.\n\nHe said: \"I went to a funfair in Mile End (in east London), and I had some tissues in my pocket. The police started searching me because they thought they were drugs.\n\n\"The way the police operate with younger people is aggressive, defensive\u2026 if they approach them in an aggressive manner, of course they're going to get the same back.\"\n\nSir Mark Rowley has accepted there are systemic biases within the Met and says he is committed to rooting out racist, homophobic and misogynistic staff.\n\nBut his decision not to endorse the word \"institutional\" was criticised by Mina Smallman, whose daughters Nicole Smallman and Bibaa Henry were murdered in London in June 2020. Two Met officers were subsequently jailed for sharing images of their bodies in a WhatsApp group.\n\nSir Mark said the word institutional is ambiguous and has been politicised.\n\nNicole Smallman and Bibaa Henry had been celebrating Ms Henry's birthday before they were reported missing\n\nMs Smallman said that black people will read the report and feel \"we've been saying this for years\".\n\nShe told the BBC \"I kind of understand what he's trying to say,\" but added: \"You have to accept this. This [institutional] is a term that the Met and big institutions fear and run away from.\"\n\nShe continued: \"I think it's weak. That weakened him,\" adding: \"It's not a time for wordplay or semantics. It's a time for action.\"\n\nResponding to the report, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Sir Mark should \"go further and faster\" to uncover the systemic problems within the Met.\n\nSetting out his view on how Labour would raise confidence in police forces across the UK, he said the party will be \"relentless in demanding progress and change\".\n\nHe added: \"The biggest danger today is that this just becomes another report.\"\n\nHome Secretary Suella Braverman said the report makes \"very concerning reading\" and shows the force \"faces a long road to recovery\".", "a 200-mile round trip just to get an NHS dentist appointment.\n\nGeorgia Wellings, 22, has been unable to get an appointment in south Wales for five years.\n\nOther patients say they have been forced to drive more than five hours each way to see a dentist, one even being denied an appointment despite having two broken teeth.\n\nThe Welsh government said it has increased funding for dentistry.\n\nLast year a BBC investigation found that in 11 out of 22 local authorities in Wales, 100% of dentistry practices contacted were unable to accept new patients.\n\nMs Wellings said on moving to Cardiff five years ago she immediately tried to find an NHS dentist \"but nobody was taking anybody on\".\n\n\"Five years later and there's still no NHS dentists available,\" she said.\n\n\"I've tried Barry, Swansea, Penarth and Bristol too - absolutely nothing.\"\n\nBefore she moved to Cardiff for university Ms Wellings was registered with an NHS dentist in Exeter, and being unable to find a new one in Wales meant she kept her name on its list.\n\nShe said she made the 200-mile round trip to Exeter twice since the start of the Covid pandemic.\n\nBut since her last appointment in January, she has been told they no longer offer NHS appointments.\n\nYour device may not support this visualisation\n\nShe said she finds it \"ridiculous\" that she has \"no other option but to go private.\"\n\n\"I'm making a conscious effort to look after my teeth a lot more in the event that I can't afford private dentists fees and emergency dental fees.\n\n\"I'm anxious about my health and about money as everyone is at the moment, so to not have an NHS dentist accessible is quite worrying at times, especially now that my only option is to go private.\"\n\nShe said she will continue to try to get an NHS appointment as the quotes she has been given for private care are \"three times the cost\" and she knows \"for a fact that I'll walk in, they'll count my teeth and I'll be walking out ten minutes later with no issues\".\n\nSarah Dickinson, 56, from Caernarfon, said she also tried and failed to get on an NHS waiting list after she and her husband moved from Halifax, Yorkshire.\n\nShe described her own teeth as \"awful\", with two being broken.\n\nSarah Dickinson says she and her husband cannot afford private dentist care and cannot access NHS services\n\n\"One of them is where the crown's fallen off, and I've actually just got the metal stud where the crown was.\n\n\"But unless your face is actually swollen you can't get an emergency appointment.\"\n\nMrs Dickinson said the metal stud cuts her tongue and catches her cheek.\n\nShe said she also has another tooth with a hole in it, and is \"worried about having smelly breath\".\n\nAnd after her husband drove for an hour to Amlwch to have a tooth \"pulled\", she said he was \"told off for not seeing the dentist more often\".\n\nMrs Dickinson and her husband have to live off about \u00a3900 a month after she was forced to retire early because of ill health.\n\nSarah Dickinson says she can't get an NHS appointment despite having two broken teeth\n\nShe said they cannot risk going private because she needs her savings to last 12 years.\n\n\"We are in despair, as our teeth are only going to get worse,\" she added.\n\nHeather Manson, 28, from Cardiff, said she and her boyfriend rang 10 NHS practices with no success.\n\nShe moved to Cardiff in 2019 and ended up travelling back to her home city of Leeds to see an NHS dentist.\n\nMs Manson said: \"A year or so later I again rung about 30 dentists, and none were accepting NHS.\"\n\nIt took four years for Heather Manson to get an NHS appointment in Wales\n\nAfter managing to get herself onto the Cardiff and Vale generic dental waiting list in August 2022 she said she never heard back about an appointment.\n\nBut a month later Ms Manson decided to go private, because \"it had been years\" since she last had her teeth checked and she \"thought it was the only option\".\n\nHowever, she was able to get an NHS appointment before she had to pay for private health care and has had a \"smooth sailing experience\".\n\nMs Manson said she thinks \"oral hygiene is very important and should be a service that everyone is entitled to easily\".\n\nBetsi Cadwaladr health board's assistant dental services director Peter Greensmith said: \"We were very sorry to hear about the difficulties Mrs Dickinson has experienced when attempting to access treatment and would encourage her to contact our patient advice and liaison service directly, so her concerns can be properly investigated.\"\n\nThe Welsh government said: \"Nearly 174,000 patients who have historically not been able to get a dental appointment received one last year.\n\n\"Health Education and

Watch: The highlights of an unusual trial - in 2 minutes\n\nHollywood actress Gwyneth Paltrow has thanked jurors who found her not liable for a 2016 ski crash at a resort in the US state of Utah.\n\nRetired optometrist Terry Sanderson, 76, had said Ms Paltrow crashed into him, inflicting life-changing injuries.\n\nMr Sanderson, who was seeking $300,000 (\u00a3245,000) in damages, said Thursday's verdict was \"very disappointing\".\n\nJurors sided with Ms Paltrow, 50, who blamed Mr Sanderson for the accident and countersued for $1 plus legal fees.\n\nListening to the verdict in court", "front in December, Gov Sitnikov told viewers that \"we need to help [the] guys so they have decent conditions\". He had brought with him crowd-funded care packages and commercially sold drones.\n\nGov Sitnikov is Vladimir Putin's placeman in his home region, so he's hardly a rebel or fearless teller of uncomfortable truths. But his willingness to visit the front and acknowledge shortcomings, even in a coded way, marks an interesting contrast with his boss.\n\nWhen local TV showed mobilised paratroopers on the 331st's parade ground six months ago, it also carried Gov Sitnikov's rather frank remarks to them: \"I'm wishing you good health, success, completion of all tasks\u2026 and that you return home alive.\"\n\nThe call-up of paratroopers, part of Russia's wider mobilisation, underlines the degree to which the Ukraine campaign has exhausted the country's professional army, of which the 331st has been a showpiece. In footage of November's parade, 150 conscripts were shown before their dispatch to the front.\n\nThe total size of the 331st regiment could be estimated at 1,500-1,700. When it first sent into Ukraine in February 2022, it deployed two battalion groups, giving a total of 1,000-1,200 soldiers. After taking heavy casualties in the failed attempt to reach Kyiv, the regiment was withdrawn and rebuilt in the southern Russian garrison town of Belgorod last summer.\n\nSubsequent action has seen the regiment moving around all the major flashpoints - Izyum in the early summer, Kherson later on, and now back to Donbas. By monitoring the dates given in the death announcements on Kostroma social media, it's possible to work out when (and often where) the unit was used to spearhead assaults, and the lulls when it was removed from the line to lick its wounds. For example, a cluster of deaths in February point to elements of the 331st being engaged in Kreminna.\n\nMark Urban reports on how the Russian 331st Regiment, and their families, are coping with Vladimir Putin's long war\n\nEach time casualty replacements - including the conscripts shown on TV in November - are brought in to replace losses, the original cadre of soldiers gets smaller, and the overall size of the unit diminishes. It may now number no more than 300-400 at the front.\n\nThe losses, and indeed the return of badly wounded men, have resonated in the home community. A few weeks into the war, one user of V'Kontake exclaimed, \"Almost every day photos of our Kostroma boys get published. It sends shivers down my spine. What's happening? When will this end?\"\n\nLocal media has been featuring commemorations of fallen Kostroma soldiers. In December, a TV station featured the unveiling of a plaque to Eduard Reunov, a paratrooper in the 331st who was killed in Ukraine. The style of this memorial and the language used in the report can be seen as an attempt to channel the Great Patriotic War (as the Russians call their 1941-45 fight against the Nazis), implying that today's soldiers are engaged in an equally important cause.\n\nLocal TV shows the unveiling of a plaque to Eduard Reunov\n\nBut on social media, we've found more modern manifestations of remembrance, and even people seeking revenge. Soldiers are shown holding shells with messages scribbled on them from Reunov's former classmates, and, supposedly, his family.\n\nThere's a trend seen in a few Russian garrison towns, for wives and mothers to post pictures of themselves with an absent soldier's uniform. One tearful mother of a dead paratrooper from the 331st remembers the Great Patriotic War, and adds, \"I hope there will be stories written about our guys\".\n\nThose questioning the sacrifice tend to get short shrift. \"Ukraine isn't my Motherland, our boys are dying for nothing,\" one person recently wrote on Kostroma's V'Kontakte page. Another swiftly countered, \"That's a stupid opinion. No point in writing that stuff here\".\n\nIt's evident from coverage of Gov Sitnikov's activities that the authorities are trying to mollify those who are anxious about the killed and wounded. It's not clear how much support the war has from the wider Russian public, but the video we've seen suggests there's a good deal of solidarity among military families in Kostroma.\n\nThe 331st's decline can also be measured in loss to machinery as well as personnel - particularly airborne infantry combat vehicles, known by the Russian initials BMD - that have been used up in successive battles.\n\nInitially, when the 331st was part of an Airborne Forces task force pushing towards Kyiv, we had difficulty identifying its vehicles in video of the fighting. A painted \"V\" was used to identify units from all of the various units in that task force, and an inverted triangle symbol with a \"3\" in the centre was also used by one other regiment apart from the 331st.\n\nAs the fighting wore on, soldiers in the 331st added a further ad hoc marking to the V on their vehicles' sides - an exclamation mark painted next to the V. They may have done this precisely so their commanders could distinguish their armour from the other regiments'.\n\nConsequently we were able to identify individual BMDs from the 331st being loaded up on railcars in March 2022, following their withdrawal from Ukraine. They then reappeared in Donbas during last summer's fighting.\n\nOpen source analysts have also identified at least 25 destroyed BMDs marked in this way, by combing Ukrainian military social media accounts. As with the dead soldiers, this visible loss does not represent the total, since many other BMDs belonging to the Kostroma regiment have likely been lost outside the view of Ukrainian troops.\n\nA report broadcast in February 2023 by the Russian network NTV shows an \"armoured group\" of the 331st in action in Luhansk. But it just tends to confirm the impression we've gleaned from other sources that the regiment survives as small detachments able to spearhead certain missions. From the call signs seen on camera this element consists of just three BMD armoured vehicles.\n\nSo, the regiment's long war goes on. Of the war's wider effects on the Ukrainian population you will glean little from Russian media, nor is there any frank coverage of war-crime allegations.\n\nThe 331st were accused of massacring hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers during fighting in 2014. For many Ukrainians, the latest Russian losses may seem like nothing more than the paratroopers getting their just deserts.\n\nMeanwhile, in Kostroma's graveyard there is plenty of evidence of the price of failure in Russia's invasion. Buried too is the regiment's reputation as \"the best of the best\", and its dreams of easy victory.\n\nTens of thousands of Harry Styles fans are in Cardiff\n\nPeople in Cardiff have woken up to a \"feather boa massacre\" following the first of two Harry Styles concerts in the city.\n\nAnd locals have more colour to look forward to as the star gears up to do it all over again in front of 60,000 at the Principality Stadium on Wednesday.\n\nStyles donned a Welsh flag during the first Cardiff show, and said it was a \"pleasure\" to be in Wales.\n\nSome fans spent days camping outside the stadium beforehand.\n\nStreets were littered with remnants of feather boas after Styles' first night in Cardiff\n\nExtravagant dress has become synonymous with Harry's style, so bright colours and feather boas are commonplace with fans.\n\nOn Twitter, one Cardiff resident described the scenes of loose feathers in the city centre on Wednesday morning as a \"feather boa massacre\".\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

Hawick, has delayed a decision on a bid to bring it back into use.\n\nThe council's planning committee was being recommended to approve the application for the site.\n\nHowever, it deferred a decision to get a \"handle on the full population\" of newts in the pond.\n\nThe castle was demolished by explosives in the 1950s\n\nParts of Cavers Castle, also known as Cavers House, are believed to date back to the 15th or 16th Centuries.\n\nThe building was substantially extended in about 1750, followed by a \"massive redesign and remodel\" in the late 19th Century.\n\nWhen one of the last owners died in 1949, a buyer could not be found for the property so its contents were auctioned off and much of it demolished by explosives in 1953.\n\nThe planning committee met to discuss its fate last month but deferred a decision for a site visit.\n\nNow the discovery of the newts has put the decision on hold again.\n\nScottish Borders Council's principal planning officer Craig Miller told councillors: \"After the last committee we did receive an indication that there may be a European Protected Species within the pond at the south end of the site.\n\n\"The applicant was asked to carry out a pond survey and that was carried out and passed to the ecology officer confirming that the species was present in the pond.\n\n\"The survey did not contain enough detail or land searches to ascertain how many of the protected species were using the site and we need to get a handle on the full population\".\n\nA decision on the plans to bring the building back into use has been delayed\n\nMembers agreed to defer a final decision until a more detailed survey had been carried out.\n\nThe committee will meet again in August but they were told there was no guarantee the information would be available in time for that.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\n\nRishi Sunak is facing questions over shares his wife holds in a childcare agency that could benefit from a new policy unveiled in the Budget.\n\nThe Chancellor announced a pilot of payments for new childminders with more for those who sign through agencies.\n\nAkshata Murty was listed as a shareholder in one of those agencies, Koru Kids, as recently as 6 March.\n\nThe prime minister's press secretary said all Mr Sunak's interests \"have been declared in the usual way\".\n\nMinisters are expected to provide a written list of all financial interests that might \"give rise to a conflict\".\n\nMr Sunak mentions Ms Murthy's venture capital company, Catamaran Ventures, in his list of ministerial interests, but does not mention Koru Kids.\n\nThe PM also did not mention Ms Murthy's links to Koru Kids when he was questioned by MPs over the policy at a parliamentary committee hearing on Tuesday.\n\nLabour MP Catherine McKinnell asked Mr Sunak whether he had any interest to declare, and in reply he said: \"No, all my disclosures are declared in the normal way.\"\n\nThe Liberal Democrats say there are \"are serious questions for Rishi Sunak to answer\" about \"any extra income his family could receive from his own government's policy\", and have urged the government's ethics adviser, Sir Laurie Magnus, to investigate Mr Sunak over a potential breach of ministerial rules.\n\nLabour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said Mr Sunak must explain why his wife's shareholding \"was not deemed necessary to publish in the register of members' interests\".\"He must urgently correct the record and set out what steps he took to avoid an actual or perceived conflict of interest,\" Ms Rayner said.\n\nWhen asked about Ms Murty's shareholding - which was reported by the i newspaper - Mr Sunak's press secretary told reporters the details of Ms Murthy's holding in the agency were not in the public domain, but indicated they would be included in the updated statement of ministers' interests, due out in May.\n\n\"The ministerial code sets out a process by which ministers declare their interests. They do that in writing, in this case to the Cabinet Secretary. That process was followed to the letter by the prime minister,\" the press secretary said.\n\nDeclarations to the Cabinet Office are not immediately available to MPs or others to see.\n\nPressed that MPs are usually expected to draw attention to an interest they have declared if questioned about it in a committee, Mr Sunak's press secretary said \"there was not a specific interest that was put to him\".\n\nThe BBC has sought to ask both the company and Ms Murthy for comment.\n\nThe pilot of bonuses for childminders was announced in the Budget on 15 March as part of the government's overhaul of childcare.\n\nMr Hunt said the government would be \"piloting incentive payments of \u00a3600 for childminders who sign up to the profession, rising to \u00a31,200 for those who join through an agency\".\n\nThe pilot could drive up the number of childminders entering the profession and generate more business for companies such as Koru Kids.\n\nKoru Kids is listed as one of six childminder agencies on the government's website.\n\nOn its website, Koru Kids welcomed the government's reforms and said \"the new incentives open to childminders are great\".\n\nThe website says new childminders would get a bonus of \u00a31,200 if they \"come through an agency like Koru Kids who offer community, training and ongoing support\".\n\nMultiple burials in the same grave are among those found at the ancient cemetery in Garforth\n\nSkeletal remains of a high-status Roman woman encased in a lead coffin have been unearthed at a hidden cemetery dating back 1,600 years.\n\nDescribed as a \"once-in-a-lifetime find\", the female remains were discovered along with 60 other bodies at the site in Garforth, Leeds.\n\nThe skeletons are believed to include both late Roman and early Saxon men, women and children.\n\nIt is thought to be the first Anglo-Saxon cemetery found in West Yorkshire.\n\nA process known as carbon-14 dating will help determine a precise age of the remains\n\nSeveral archaeologists worked for weeks excavating the site and removing the lead coffin\n\nThe cemetery was discovered as part of a standard archaeological survey on the site, which had been earmarked for development.\n\nExperts said the fact the coffin had been made out of lead signified the skeleton was someone of importance.\n\nDavid Hunter, principal archaeologist for West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service, said: \"Lead coffins were expensive. The fact the family gave this person the expense of getting sheets of lead and the expertise to make the coffin, then it tells us a lot.\"\n\nOther burial practices found in the cemetery indicate early Christian beliefs as well as Sax", "stories I pursued. My main goal was to find answers for Martine's family, who regard her death as a test of international law. The UK has no extradition treaty with Yemen.\n\nBut it wasn't until last year that I finally managed to make contact with Farouk Abdulhak. My communication with him began over social media. Hundreds of journalists have reached out to him over the years and he has ignored them all. But our shared Yemeni background helped me gain his trust. Ten days after we first started texting, he sent me the first of what would turn out to be a series of revelatory messages.\n\n\"I did something when I was younger, it was a mistake,\" he wrote.\n\nDuring the thousands of texts and hundreds of voice notes he sent me over five months, not once did he use Martine's name or refer to her death, preferring the terms \"incident\" or \"accident\".\n\nBut the coroner's report made clear how violently the Norwegian student had died - the result of \"compression to the neck\" which \"could mean she was strangled, held down or smothered\". Her body showed 43 cuts and grazes, \"many of them typical of assault type injuries or those received in a struggle\".\n\nNawal Al-Maghafi on the phone to Farouk Abdulhak\n\nFarouk and Martine both studied at Regent's Business School in London, and Martine was hoping to become a financier in the capital. The last time her friends saw her alive was during the early hours of 14 March 2008, at the exclusive Maddox nightclub in Mayfair, where she and Farouk were celebrating the end of exams.\n\nThose friends say Farouk then offered to host an after-party at his apartment in Great Portland Street, central London. They were too tired to go, but say Martine wanted to continue partying. CCTV shows her leaving the club with Farouk at 02:59. There are no witnesses as to what happened next. By sunrise, she would be dead - though her body would not be discovered for at least another 48 hours. By this time, Farouk had fled the UK on a flight to Cairo. He then got on his father's private jet to Yemen. Farouk's lawyer insisted he was innocent of murder.\n\nFarouk isn't just any Yemeni. Brought up between the US and Egypt, he is the son of Shaher Abdulhak, one of the richest and most powerful men in Yemen. He forged an empire of sugar, soft drinks, oil and arms, and was a close friend of the president at the time, Ali Abdullah Saleh.\n\nWhen I first tried to speak to Farouk in 2011, I spent months in Yemen looking for him. But I had to leave when the authorities warned me to drop the story.\n\nIn February 2022 I decided to look into the case again - from London. By this time, Farouk's father had died and president Saleh had stepped down. I wondered if it would now be possible to get Farouk to talk.\n\nBut I also knew it wouldn't be easy. When a friend got hold of his number, I messaged him over several different apps but received no response. And then the friend noticed he was using Snapchat.\n\nNawal had been trying to make contact with Farouk Abdulhak for years\n\nI sent him a message and he responded within seconds. His first question was to ask where I was from. I gave him the name of the affluent Yemeni neighbourhood I grew up in, sensing that he was probably based there too. I was right. Immediately his interest was piqued.\n\nNow I had opened a dialogue with him, it was a matter of gaining his trust, especially as I never hid my profession - in our first few exchanges I told him I was a journalist.\n\nOur initial chats were simply about our similar experiences. Despite his incredible wealth, in some ways we had a lot in common. We exchanged stories of skiing in the same Swiss resorts, studying in international schools and the places we both liked going to in London.\n\nAnd then he started to open up.\n\n\"I did something when I was younger it was a mistake\u2026,\" he texted. \"I told you my real name, I can't specifically go to the UK for something that happened there.\n\n\"The only reason I am scared is you told me you're a writer and journalist.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: BBC reporter Nawal Al-Maghafi plays recordings of her phone conversations with Farouk Abdulhak for Martine\u2019s father\n\n\"You're the last person I should talk to.\"\n\nThe speed at which he began to take me into his trust might seem surprising, but bear in mind that Farouk is incredibly isolated. His entire family lives outside Yemen - including his now ex-wife and daughter - having fled the country's devastating civil war. But he dare not visit any of them for fear of arrest.\n\nNone of his friends who I spoke to during my investigation have heard from him since he fled - though all said they were shocked when they read about Martine's death at the time, saying his suspected involvement seemed completely out of character.\n\nMartine, Cecilie and Nina in Maddox night club on the night she died (far left to right)\n\nNow that Farouk seemed ready to share more, I made it explicit that I worked for the BBC and wanted to report on his story.\n\nAmazingly, this did not stop him talking.\n\nSo I asked him to elaborate on an earlier text exchange in which he'd talked about having \"major regrets\". He replied:\n\n\"1: I deeply regret the unfortunate accident that happened. 2 regret coming here [to Yemen] should have stayed and paid the piper.\"\n\nAt the same time, I was also interviewing other people connected with the case, including Martine's father and closest friends. This made the investigation one of the most difficult I've ever worked on. While I was speaking to those whose lives had been devastated by Martine's death and were desperate for answers, my phone was continually pinging with messages from Farouk.\n\nMartine's friends Nina Brantzeg and Cecilie Dahl were with her in Maddox nightclub the night she died. Cecilie had met Farouk with Martine before, and says they were friends. But that evening, he seemed different, she says - becoming upset when one of them took a photo of him and Martine, though Martine seemed unaware of anything unusual.\n\nAnother of Martine's friends, Thale Lassen, says she thinks Farouk had once tried to kiss Martine, and she had told him she wasn't interested. In fact, she says, Martine would often crash at his flat as it was so central. CCTV shows her linking arms with Farouk as they leave the club.\n\nWhen Martine didn't come home the next day, her friends reported her missing, but say it wasn't until someone noticed Farouk had deleted his Facebook account that police took matters seriously. They searched Farouk's apartment and quickly found her semi-naked body in the basement of his block.\n\nBy this time he had fled the UK. The police knew that Farouk had taken a commercial flight from London to Cairo, but didn't have detailed knowledge of his escape.\n\nMartine (right) and Farouk on the night she died\n\nI have managed to track down one of Farouk's father's closest friends in London - a man I am calling Samir. He told me he had received a call from Farouk in the early hours of 14 March asking for cash, saying he was urgently needed at home in Cairo and his credit cards weren't working. Samir says that while he was out getting the cash, Farouk passed out on his sofa, and it took pouring ice cold water on his face to revive him.\n\n\"It was as if he was on something,\" Samir tells me.\n\nHe says Farouk bought a ticket for the next flight to Cairo, and we know that from there his father transported him to Yemen - somewhere Farouk had never lived before, but from where it would be impossible to extradite him.\n\nI spoke about this further with another friend of Farouk's father - Jordanian businessman Abdulhay Al Mejali.\n\n\"His son wanted to go to England and sit in court and defend himself,\" he told me. \"But his father advised him not to get involved [and] stay in Yemen.\"\n\nJessica Wadsworth, the Met police's lead investigator on the case at the time, adm", "itals would form the new regional centres, saying accusations to the contrary were \"baseless\".\n\nEm: 'They push the drugs on you so early on'\n\nWhile Gids has helped some young people, critics - including young trans people seen by the clinic - claim it was sometimes too quick to refer young people for medical interventions and it could overlook mental health difficulties.\n\n\"They push the drugs on you so early on,\" Em, a 19-year-old trans man, who has identified as male since early childhood, told Newsnight. Em says he was offered medication during his second appointment, adding: \"I was 11.\"\n\nAfter five appointments, Gids referred Em to UCLH for puberty blockers. These were prescribed by Prof Butler when Em was 12. He stayed on them for nearly four years.\n\nWhile the blockers slowed Em's puberty, they didn't stop it. He was put on higher doses and, when that did not work, he was administered beta blockers. Em later collapsed at school.\n\n\"To me that was dangerous\", Em's mother told Newsnight. Em suffered violent mood swings and gained lots of weight while on the blockers.\n\nHe stopped taking puberty blockers in 2019 and hasn't chosen to take hormones to masculinise his body. Since being discharged in 2020, neither Gids nor UCLH has been in touch with Em.\n\n\"I feel completely forgotten about,\" he says now. \"I still don't know what is happening with my body [or] what the blockers did.\"\n\nThe NHS says little is known about the long-term side effects of puberty blockers in children with gender dysphoria. Dr Cass has insisted there needs to be more research.\n\nBoth the NHS and Dr Cass have made it clear that staff at the new gender identity services for children must have wider experience of working with young people - including expertise in autism, mental health and safeguarding.\n\nEm says the new services must be different. \"The new system needs to be a mental health service,\" he says, and offer more holistic care for trans people. \"For them, you weren't transgender unless you're willing to go the full way [in medically transitioning]. I was a child. I did not know what I was doing.\"\n\nIn a statement, the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust said it had reviewed Newsnight's claims, adding that they \"do not align with the evidence we have\", though it declined to give specifics about that evidence.\n\nIt said it works on a case-by-case basis with every young person, their family and local services, but said it was inappropriate to comment on Em's individual patient care.\n\n\"Patients who begin medical treatment do so only after they've been fully assessed (including mental health), and only if the parent/carer is supportive,\" the trust added.\n\nA UCLH spokesman also said it would be inappropriate to comment on an individual patient's care, but added that Gids clinicians \"discuss non-medical interventions with patients before and after referral to our endocrinology clinic\".\n\n\"Patients only begin medical treatment if they are assessed as having full competence to consent and there is parental support,\" UCLH said, adding that the clinic follows the service specification set out by NHS England.\n\nNHS England, which commissions children's gender identity services, said all aspects of the new service would be guided by the ongoing findings and expert advice from the Cass Review.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care agreed, adding that an oversight group will ensure training is in line with the new clinical approach.\n\nMartin Hibbert and his daughter Eve have been targeted with conspiracy theories\n\nManchester Arena bomb survivors have filed landmark legal action against a conspiracy theorist who claims the attack was faked.\n\nMartin and Eve Hibbert, who were left with severe disabilities after the 2017 blast, are suing Richard D Hall for defamation and harassment.\n\nIt is the first time such action has been launched in the UK against a conspiracy theorist.\n\nMr Hall did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.\n\nMartin Hibbert was paralysed from the waist down and his daughter Eve left severely disabled by the Manchester Arena blast which killed 22 people in 2017.\n\nLast October, a Radio 4 podcast series and BBC Panorama investigation revealed they are among victims targeted by conspiracy theorist Richard D Hall, who has described online how he tracks down survivors to their homes and workplaces to see if they are lying about their injuries.\n\nMr Hall admitted to the BBC that he spied on Miss Hibbert from a vehicle parked outside her home.\n\nHe has also described his tactics in a book he sells, and has promoted theories online that several other UK terror attacks were staged.\n\nNow, the family is seeking an injunction to restrain Mr Hall from making similar allegations in future and damages for some of the harm he has caused them.\n\nThe case echoes the action against US conspiracist Alex Jones, who was ordered to pay nearly $1.5bn by a US court to families of the US Sandy Hook school shooting after falsely claiming the 2012 attack was a hoax.\n\n\"Martin can be seen as a pioneering trailblazer for others to follow if they feel so minded,\" his lawyer Neil Hudgell said.\n\nMr Hibbert hopes the action will finally stop Mr Hall and set a UK precedent to help protect other people who survive disasters from these conspiracies and tactics.\n\n\"It does sometimes feel like a bit of a weight, so it would be nice to be able to put it to bed and just be able to move on with our lives,\" he said.\n\nFollowing the BBC's investigation, Mr Hall's YouTube channel, with over 80,000 followers, was removed and his market stall closed. However, his books and DVDs featuring false claims about terror attacks are still for sale on his website, along with videos about the Manchester Arena Attack.\n\nIn December, Mr Hall created a new \"True Crime\" section on his site listing various events and high-profile deaths, including the recent disappearance of 45-year-old Nicola Bulley.\n\nMr Hall's defiant response to the BBC investigation and the initial letter from Mr Hibbert's legal team suggests he is yet to change his mind on these conspiracy theories. He continues to defend the book he has written claiming the Manchester Arena attack was staged.\n\nHe also says he has received online death threats as a result of the investigation.\n\nBut terror attack survivors have also reported that incidents of trolling and conspiracy theories seem to have reduced since it was publicised.\n\nThe BBC approached Mr Hall again after the legal case was officially filed, but he did not respond to our request for comment. During the original investigation, when he was confronted at his market stall, he insisted the BBC was wrong about how he operates.\n\nManchester's Mayor, Andy Burnham, has met Mr Hibbert to discuss campaigning for a new law that could better protect survivors of tragedies from harassment and conspiracy theories.\n\nBut such legislation would not be straightforward - social media sites and policy makers have been grappling with hate and disinformation online for some time, with no simple solutions.\n\n\"It is always difficult to change the law, and it doesn't happen overnight,\" Mr Burnham said. \"But most people will see the case for this because of the appalling nature of targeting people in this way.\"\n\nThe UK is currently introducing new legislation - the online safety bill - that will mean social media sites have to make commitments to the regulator Ofcom, stating they will protect users.\n\nBut there has been lots of debate over how far it will go and it has avoided directly addressing disinformation and abuse targeting adults online due to fears about freedom of expression.\n\nThis kind of legislation could face the same opposition.\n\nListen to the Bonus Episode of Radio 4's Disaster Trolls on BBC Sounds.\n\u2022 None The UK terror survivors tracked down by conspiracists\n\nA forensic tent was set up and police could be seen combing the area\n\nThe discovery of a human torso in a secluded woodland has sparked a murder investigation.\n\nPolice said the alarm was raised when a passer-by spotted the \"unknown item\" in Kersal Wetlands, Salford, on Thursday.\n\nDetectives and a pathologist confirmed human remains were found wrapped in plastic.\n\nPolice are searching the rest of the wood", ", handwritten wills were found in a cabinet and under a sofa cushion at her home in suburban Detroit, Michigan.\n\nA jury will now determine which of two documents should be ruled as the Queen of Soul's valid last testament.\n\nThe trial began on Monday and is expected to last less than a week.\n\nA six-person jury at the Oakland County Probate Court will hear from witnesses, including the Franklin children, her niece Sabrina Owens and a handwriting expert.\n\nAn 18-time Grammy Award winner, Franklin recorded dozens of chart-topping songs and was the first woman inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nBut the singer known for hits like Think, I Say a Little Prayer and Respect was intensely private about her finances and is said to have resisted preparing a formal will despite years of ill health.\n\nWhen she died at age 76 the absence of a will meant her assets - including homes, cars, furs and jewellery - were to be equally split among her four sons.\n\nBut nine months on from her death, wills were discovered at her home.\n\nOne son is arguing that the papers dated June 2010 and found inside a locked cabinet are the real will.\n\nTwo other sons say a will dated March 2014 and found in a spiral notebook under sofa cushions should take precedence.\n\nOn Monday, Judge Jennifer Callaghan told jurors the only decision they had to make was whether the 2014 document can be accepted as a valid will.\n\nDespite their differences, both documents would see the sons share revenue from Franklin's music and copyrights.\n\nEach version was scribbled by hand and difficult to decipher, with words scratched out and notes in the margins. Such a condition would make them inadmissible in most states, but Michigan law allows for handwritten wills as long as they meet other criteria.\n\nTheodore White II - Franklin's third child, from her brief marriage to her former manager - argues that the notarised 11-page document from 2010 is the valid will.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Aretha Franklin: In her own words\n\nThat version lists him as a co-executor or personal representative to the estate, along with Ms Owens, the niece. It also calls for Kecalf and Edward Franklin, the singer's second and fourth sons, to \"take business classes and get a certificate or a degree\" if they wish to benefit from the estate.\n\nMeanwhile, Kecalf and Edward argue that the 2014 version is their mother's primary will.\n\nKecalf replaces his brother as a co-executor in the four-page document. He and his grandchildren would also inherit his mother's $1.2m (\u00a3934,000) gated mansion - a home described by Edward's attorney as \"the crown jewel\".\n\nThe newer document also stipulates that Franklin's gowns either be auctioned or handed over to the Smithsonian Institute in Washington.\n\nClarence Franklin, the eldest child, is not involved in the dispute. He lives in an assisted living facility in Michigan and is under a legal guardianship.\n\nA lawyer for his guardian told the BBC they will not participate in the trial and \"have reached a settlement that gives Clarence a percentage of the estate without regard to the outcome of the will contest\".\n\nThe family rift had earlier driven Ms Owens to quit as representative of her aunt's estate.\n\n\"Given my aunt's love of family and desire for privacy, this is not what she would have wanted for us, nor is it what I want,\" she wrote in a 2020 court filing.\n\n\"I love my cousins, hold no animosity towards them, and wish them the best.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Fans pay their respects to Aretha Franklin in Detroit\n\nEarlier this year, the court in Pontiac, Michigan, heard three voicemail messages, recorded in the months before Franklin died, in which she discusses another will she was preparing with an estate lawyer.\n\nIn the messages, Franklin is heard expressing certain \"firm intentions\" from a Detroit hospital bed, but attorney Henry Grix testified he believed she \"hadn't made up her mind\" about her final wishes.\n\nThe judge has excluded that document from consideration in the trial.\n\nThe Franklin fortune was estimated at $80m when the star died in 2018, but more recent valuations and several years of unpaid taxes have vastly reduced that number.\n\nAccording to an inventory filed in court, and seen by the BBC, the late singer's assets are valued at just under $6m.\n\nNicholas Papasifakis, who currently serves as Franklin's personal representative, said he is not participating in the trial and is not taking a side in the dispute.\n\n\"Once there has been a determination by the Court as to the disposition of Ms Franklin's Estate,\" he wrote in an email, \"I will follow that determination in distributing Ms Franklin's assets.\"\n\n\"I wanted to found a bank that was really good for customers, that was fair,\" says Anne Boden\n\nAnne Boden is stepping down as chief executive of Starling Bank, nine years after founding the company.\n\nThe Welsh businesswoman said it was the right time to step aside as it reported a record pre-tax profit of \u00a3195m, a six-fold increase on the previous year.\n\nShe will step down on 30 June, but will stay on the board and still part-own the company.\n\nStarling was one of a few so-called challenger banks which promised to revolutionise the UK sector.\n\nWith no branches, it prides itself on its app and customer service.\n\nMs Boden announced her departure as the bank published its latest profits for 2022-23.\n\nThe bank says it has begun a search across the globe for a new chief executive\n\nRevealing her intention to leave in an exclusive interview with BBC Wales, Ms Boden said: \"It's thrilling. When I look back at how I started Starling, I never thought we would get to this stage.\n\n\"Starling is bigger than just one person, it is bigger than a founder-led organisation. It is a piece of infrastructure that is important to the UK. We provide a real role in society.\"\n\nMs Boden, 63, said it was \"not really appropriate\" for Starling to continue to have a shareholder as its chief executive. She still owns 4.9% of the company and keeps a seat on the board as a non-executive director.\n\nStarling Bank said it has begun a global search for a new chief executive, with chief operating officer John Mountain taking the interim role.\n\nThe departing chief executive says she had become ashamed to be a banker before launching Starling\n\nStarling has grown steadily from its initial base of personal customers, adding business accounts and acquiring a mortgage book, partly due to its purchase of Fleet Mortgages.\n\nMs Boden, decided to pursue her dream of launching a bank after becoming disenchanted with the banking world.\n\n\"People never believed that a 5ft tall Welsh woman in her mid-50s could do something that had never been done before,\" she said.\n\n\"I had become ashamed to be a banker, I was ashamed to be part of that whole regime that had let the country down.\n\n\"I wanted to do something different, I wanted to found a bank that was really good for customers, that was fair. And people never believed I could do it and be profitable.\n\n\"So here we are, we have done it, proof positive.\"\n\nMs Boden said Starling Bank would continue to grow and believes it can take more customers from the older, more established banks.\n\nStarling will eventually list itself on the stock exchange, she said.\n\nThe bank has no branches and uses a mobile app for its services\n\nListing a firm on a stock exchange takes it from being a private to a public company, with investors able to buy and sell shares on specific exchanges. Companies usually list on stock exchanges to gain access to a wider range of investors.\n\n\"It's not going to be this year, but eventually Starling will list,\" she said.\n\n\"It will be at the right time.\"\n\nAs a result of her success with Starling, she has become a role model for women in finance. She chairs a UK government task force that aims to boost the number of women launching fast-growing businesses.\n\n\"When women get the investment, when", "\nMr Polak said his client was \"speechless\" and \"too tired to smile\" after being cleared of murder, adding: \"He said he hadn't slept for three or four days, but he is very pleased about what happened.\n\n\"He would like to thank everyone who supported him in this case. This is the result he was looking for.\"\n\nA plea deal, which would have seen Hunter admit manslaughter, was agreed with prosecutors in November but the murder trial went ahead after the Cypriot authorities made a legal U-turn.\n\nThe couple's daughter, Lesley Cawthorne, said she was \"genuinely stunned\" by the verdict.\n\n\"My dad's not a murderer,\" she said. \"My dad's never been a murderer. Now everybody knows that. It's just incredible. I can't believe it.\"\n\nMs Cawthorne said her father now had a \"real chance\" of seeing \"the light of day again\".\n\n\"He had almost two years of being a prisoner during lockdown, and then he went straight from that into prison. He's had over three years of his life that have been lived at somebody else's kind of whim.\"\n\nDavid Hunter's daughter said he would want to spend time at his wife's grave after 19 months in prison\n\nShe said he would probably choose to stay in Cyprus for a little longer \"to spend some time with my mum\" and visit her grave, which he has never seen.\n\nMs Cawthorne said Hunter would also need \"time and space to acclimatise\" before he could be the \"best version of himself\" and see family again.\n\nShe said the past 19 months of his incarceration had been exhausting but now there was \"light at the end of the tunnel\".\n\nAs David Hunter walked into the courtroom, his friend Barry, who made the journey here from Northumberland, reached out and held his hand.\n\n\"Hello mate,\" he said. \"You've got 166 messages of support from people back home.\"\n\nFor a brief moment, the 76-year-old accused of murdering his wife had a smile.\n\nOver the past year and a half, he has been coming to this court hoping he could make the judges understand the sad and sorry situation he was in.\n\nJanice was \"sick of life\" he told them. He was making nappies for her and she was ashamed to leave the house. She was hysterical because of the pain.\n\nHe \"loved her so much\", he said, but she begged him to end her suffering.\n\nThis was an emotional case, but for the judges it came down to one thing. Was this premeditated murder? By discussing a suicide pact, did that mean it was planned?\n\nToday, a judge told the court Hunter wasn't cold enough, not calculated enough to murder his sick wife.\n\nAt that point, David Hunter's lawyer looked up at his client and winked. The former miner who came here preparing for a life sentence, then knew there was hope.\n\nAs he left the courtroom, the pensioner hugged his legal team and told them he wanted to smile, but didn't have the strength.\n\nDavid Hunter admitted killing his wife and he will be punished for that, but his daughter Lesley said: \"This is the best possible outcome for my dad.\"\n\nIn May, Hunter told the court his wife begged him for five or six weeks to end her suffering.\n\nHe broke down in tears as he said he would \"never in a million years\" have taken her life unless she had asked him to.\n\n\"She wasn't just my wife, she was my best friend,\" he said, adding her pleas became more intense each day.\n\nHe eventually relented and suffocated her after she became \"hysterical\", he said, adding: \"I was hoping she would change her mind. I loved her so much.\"\n\nDavid Hunter killed his wife at their home in Tremithousa, Cyprus\n\nHunter told reporters his time in a Cypriot prison was \"nothing\" compared to the last six months of his wife's life.\n\nSpeaking in June 2022, Ms Cawthorne told the BBC her mother had been \"in absolute agony\" in her final months.\n\nBarry Kent, a friend of Hunter's who has raised thousands of pounds from people in Ashington to help fund legal costs, had travelled to Cyprus to be in court for the verdict.\n\nHe said: \"I am looking forward to having a beer with him and spending some time with him, whether it is here or back in England.\n\n\"To be honest, he needs a good feed. He looked terrible. If we had a meal together we would have a full English.\n\n\"He is an absolute shell of himself.

It said there were exemptions to the ban under some circumstances.\n\nSome politicians are also reluctant to give up the TikTok habit, despite the security warnings.\n\nCabinet minister Grant Shapps - an enthusiastic TikTokker - reacted to the ban by posting a clip from the film, Wolf Of Wall Street, in which Leonardo DiCaprio, playing a New York stockbroker, uses a series of expletives and declares: \"The show goes on\".\n\nMr Shapps called the ban \"sensible\", but added: \"I've never used TikTok on government devices and can hereby confirm I will NOT be leaving TikTok anytime soon!\"\n\nMinisters have not been banned from using the site on their personal phones - just their work devices.\n\nBut Nadine Dorries - who experimented with TikTok videos when she was culture secretary - said she would be deleting the app from her personal phone, adding: \"I think all MPs should do likewise.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

It may be that this group are unaware they have the condition because they are less likely to access healthcare if they are otherwise well,\" he said.\n\n\"These results will provide valuable insight for health services and those seeking to improve outcomes for what is one of the most common causes of premature death, especially as we know that the sooner hypertension is identified, the more effectively it can be managed and treated among all ages.\"\n\nAbout a third of adults in the UK have high blood pressure, but many are not aware of it, experts say.\n\nBeing overweight, eating an unhealthy diet, not being active, drinking too much alcohol and smoking can all raise blood pressure.\n\nAccording to the ONS, young men were particularly likely to be undiagnosed - 66% of males and 26% of females aged 16 to 24 years, and 55% of males and 44% of females aged 25 to 34 years, compared with 17% of males and 21% of females aged 75 years and over.\n\nThe data comes from the Health Survey for England, which carried out at-home blood pressure measurements on 20,000 people - including 1,500 young people - taken by a nurse on a few different occasions to obtain an average reading.\n\nDr Pauline Swift, from the charity Blood Pressure UK, said while some risk factors, such as ageing and ethnicity, are unavoidable, others are within people's control.\n\n\"In recent years we have seen an increase in younger patients with high blood pressure, often as a result of poor diet, consuming too much salt and lack of exercise leading to weight gain,\" she said.\n\n\"If you start making small changes to your lifestyle when you are young, such as eating less salt, more fruit and vegetables and taking more exercise to maintain a healthy weight, then you are more likely to stay healthier and prevent strokes, heart disease and chronic kidney disease.\n\n\"High blood pressure kills thousands of people every year in the UK and is almost entirely preventable.\n\n\"Everyone needs to take control of their health by checking their blood pressure either at home, at a pharmacy or with their practice nurse. This could save your life.\"\n\nProf Bryan Williams, President of the International Society of Hypertension, and a specialist at University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust in London, said: \"I just don't think people realise just how dangerous untreated high blood pressure can be.\n\n\"It is estimated that high blood pressure causes 10 million deaths every year across the world. To put this in perspective, that is more deaths globally every year than the total number of global deaths caused by Covid over three years.\n\n\"The good news is that once high blood pressure is properly diagnosed, for most people it is easy to treat and control, especially if it is diagnosed early.\n\n\"If I have a simple message it is, get your blood pressure checked and don't ignore it if it is high.\"\n\nBlood pressure is measured in millimetres of mercury (mmHg). The healthy range is between 90 over 60mmHg and 120 over 80mmHg.\n\nGeneral Ivan Popov has been commanding forces in the Zaporizhzhia region\n\nA top Russian general says he has been removed from his post in Ukraine after telling military chiefs the truth about the dire situation on the front line.\n\nMaj Gen Ivan Popov was the commander of the 58th Army, which has been fighting in the southern Zaporizhzhia region.\n\nIn a voice message, Maj Gen Popov said he raised questions about high casualty rate and lack of artillery support.\n\n\"It was necessary either to keep quiet and be a coward or to say it the way it is,\" he said.\n\n\"I had no right to lie in the name of you, in the name of my fallen comrades in arms, so I outlined all the problems which exist.\"\n\nThe voice message was posted to telegram by Russian MP Andrei Gurulyov, who is a former military commander and frequent commentator on state TV. It is unclear when the message was recorded.\n\nAmong the issues Maj Gen Popov said he highlighted to his superiors were the lack of proper counter battery systems to help repel Ukrainian artillery attacks, as well as a lack of military intelligence.\n\nThe commander said his dismissal was demanded by senior commanders - who he accused of treason - and approved by the Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu.\n\nRussian military bloggers - often the most insightful form of information in the absence of official comment from Moscow - reported that the order to dismiss Maj Gen Popov had come from the head of Russia's armed forces, Gen Valery Gerasimov.\n\nThey said Gen Gerasimov accused Maj Gen Popov of \"alarmism and blackmailing senior management\" after he highlighted the need to rotate soldiers who had been in the front line for a sustained period of time and had suffered significant losses.\n\n\"The senior chiefs apparently sensed some kind of danger from me and quickly concocted an order from the defence minister in just one day and got rid of me,\" Maj Gen Popov said.\n\n\"The Ukrainian army could not break through our ranks at the front but our senior chief hit us from the rear, viciously beheading the army at the most difficult and intense moment.\"\n\nThe Russian defence ministry has yet to comment on the dismissal.\n\nHowever, a senior official of the pro-government United Russia party, of which Mr Gurulyov is a member, criticised the MP for making a \"political show\" out of Maj Gen Popov's remarks.\n\n\"General Popov's statement was not public and was posted on closed chats of the commanders and troops of the 58th Army,\" Andrei Turchak wrote on telegram.\n\n\"Let the fact that... Gurulyov somehow got hold of this and made a political show out of it remain on his conscience,\" he said, adding that Maj Gen Popov's conscience was clear and the country could be proud of commanders like him.\n\nZaporizhzhia and the eastern Donetsk region have become the focus of Ukraine's counteroffensive, which was launched over a month ago, but has struggled to penetrate well established Russian defensive lines.\n\nOn Wednesday, another Russian MP said former Russian commander Gen Sergei Surovikin, who has not been seen in public since the Wagner mutiny, was \"resting\".\n\nGen Surovikin was said to enjoy close relations with the former Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin and there had been media reports that he had been arrested following the brief revolt.\n\nThere has been no official confirmation or comment about his whereabouts.\n\nMeanwhile, another senior Russian general - Lt Gen Oleg Tsokov - is said to have been killed in a strike in Ukraine's occupied south coast this week, although his death has not been officially confirmed by Russia's defence ministry.\n\nEintracht Frankfurt fans have clashed with police in Italy ahead of their club's Champions League last-16 match against Napoli.\n\nFootage showed chairs being hurled at riot police, who had been responding with tear gas.\n\nNaples authorities had banned residents of the German city from buying tickets for the match, after violence during the first leg in Frankfurt.\n\nMore on this story: Eintracht fans clash with police before Napoli tie\n\n\"There is no free lunch\" when it comes to funding public companies such as Thames Water, Lord Howard has told the BBC.\n\nThe firm, which is billions of pounds in debt, faces a crisis, prompting fresh calls", "Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. More coverage details\n\nDefending champion Novak Djokovic reached a fifth successive Wimbledon men's final where Carlos Alcaraz will try to end the Serb's recent dominance.\n\nSecond seed Djokovic, 36, won 6-3 6-4 7-6 (7-4) against Italian eighth seed Jannik Sinner in the semi-finals.\n\nDjokovic is one more win from an eighth Wimbledon men's title and 24th major title - both record-equalling tallies.\n\nSpanish top seed Alcaraz, 20, won 6-3 6-3 6-3 against Russian third seed Daniil Medvedev later on Friday.\n\nAlcaraz outclassed Medvedev in the second semi-final, also played under the Centre Court roof, to reach his first final at the All England Club.\n\nBy contrast, Djokovic has reached his ninth Wimbledon showpiece.\n\u2022 None Follow live text, TV and radio of the Wimbledon men's semi-finals\n\nIt will also be a record 35th Grand Slam final appearance after he surpassed the tally he previously shared with American Chris Evert.\n\nDjokovic has not lost a completed match at Wimbledon since 2016 and has not been beaten on Centre Court since 2013.\n\n\"In the semi-finals, it was always going to be a very close and very tense match,\" said Djokovic, who is 14 years and 86 days older than Sinner.\n\n\"That was the case and the scoreline doesn't give the reality of what was happening on the court. It was super close.\n\n\"Jannik has proven why he is one of the leaders of the next generation and one of the best players in the world.\n\n\"I tried not to look at age as a hindrance or a factor of the outcome. I guess 36 is the new 26.\"\n\nThe contrast between Djokovic and Sinner in terms of experience was laid bare by the statistics before the match - and borne out in reality during it.\n\nSinner, 21, was playing his first Grand Slam semi-final, while Djokovic was contesting a 46th major semi-final - equalling Roger Federer's all-time men's record.\n\nDjokovic, who turned 36 in May, was bidding to become the third oldest man in the Open era to reach the final. Sinner was aiming to become the youngest since 2007.\n\nKnowledge of how to succeed on the biggest occasions in the sport, plus the ability to execute when it matters the most, proved to be the key.\n\nSinner was not able to convert any of his six break points in the match, including two in the opening game and another later in the pivotal first set.\n\nDjokovic converted his only opportunity in the first set and demonstrated his ability to clinically close out, hitting three aces and a service winner from 0-15 down at 5-3 in the opener.\n\nWith Sinner having not faced a seed in his run to the last four, Djokovic was a considerable step up in class.\n\nThings looked increasingly ominous for the Italian when he handed over a break for 2-1 in the second set.\n\nA fourth chance to take Djokovic's serve went begging in the fourth game - where the Serb was docked a point for hindrance, judged by British umpire Richard Haigh to have disturbed Sinner with a long grunt, and then warned for taking too long to serve.\n\nAfter his jaw dropped in disbelief and had words with the official, Djokovic quickly regained focus to hold.\n\nThe former world number one went on to serve out the second set without facing a further break point and few would have backed Sinner to turn the match around at that point.\n\nThe Italian refused to wilt like many expected and instead raised his level to push Djokovic in a tight third set.\n\nDjokovic was becoming increasingly tetchy as a result.\n\nHe had an exchange with a fan after saving two set points at 5-4, sarcastically telling them to stop crying, then smiling in the same direction after securing victory in the tie-break.\n\nAlcaraz underlines talent in 'one of best' performances on grass\n\nAlcaraz and Medvedev have both won major titles on the US Open hard courts, but were attempting to reach the SW19 showpiece for the first time after a summer of marked improvement at the All England Club.\n\nAlcaraz is playing in only his fourth professional tournament on grass courts and had won the Queen's title in the run-up.\n\nIt is testament to his outstanding talent he has become the youngest Wimbledon men's finalist since Spanish 22-time Grand Slam champion Rafael Nadal in 2007.\n\nConfidence in his footwork has continued to build over the British grass-court season, providing the platform for the athletic Spaniard to use his hefty serve, booming groundstrokes and deft drop-shot to devastating effect.\n\nGrowing up in Murcia, clay courts are seen as his most natural surface but hard courts are where he won his first major at Flushing Meadows last year.\n\nNow he has emerged as a force on grass and underlined the fact again with a dominant win over Medvedev.\n\nThere was little between the pair until Alcaraz broke late in the first set. With the momentum, he took serve twice more in the second before eventually wrapping up the third by ending a run of four straight breaks.\n\n\"I played great. I thought a really good level, tennis level and tactical level as well,\" Alcaraz said.\n\n\"It was one of my best matches on grass.

There, at least 11 detainees - mostly young women - were subjected to physical abuse at the hands of a plainclothes police officer.\n\nAnastasia identified the police officer who abused her using a data leak from a food delivery app\n\nThe officer didn't give his name, and there was no record of him on any police websites. The protesters felt they had little chance in identifying their abuser, who they called the \"man in black\".\n\nThat was until a huge data leak from the popular Russian food delivery app, Yandex Food, provided the breakthrough they needed.\n\nAnastasia - who says she had been suffocated with a plastic bag by the \"man in black\" - trawled through the data and found only nine users who had ordered food to Brateyevo police station. Working with the other victims, she searched the names and phone numbers included in the leak, looking for pictures she recognised.\n\nFinally she came across a face that was imprinted in her memory - it was the \"man in black\" and his name was Ivan Ryabov.\n\nAnastasia also wanted to identify another officer who was present that evening and refused to give his name. The detainees had called him the \"man in beige\".\n\nAlthough he wasn't involved in the abuse of protesters, Anastasia felt he was somehow in charge. \"All communication took place through him,\" she said.\n\nUsing facial recognition on a short video captured inside the police station, the BBC was able to name the man as Alexander Fedorinov. At that time, he was the acting head of the Brateyevo police department.\n\nThe BBC identified Alexander Fedorinov, acting head of the Brateyevo police department, from this video\n\nDespite appeals mentioning Ryabov and Fedorinov, sent to Russian authorities from victims and a Moscow politician, there was no evidence that either of the men had faced any repercussions inside Russia. The BBC did not receive a response after contacting the two men for comment in August 2022.\n\nBut as of 7 March 2023, both men are now subject to an asset freeze and travel ban within the EU.\n\nAnastasia told the BBC that the year since her arrest has not been easy. \"But Ryabov's inclusion on the sanctions list only strengthens my belief that I did and said the right thing,\" she said.\n\nAnastasia has left Russia and says she is happy to be in a country where she isn't afraid to share her anti-war views on social media.\n\nIvan Ryabov and Alexander Fedorinov were sanctioned alongside two acting Taliban ministers - Neda Mohammad Nadeem and Muhammad Khalid Hanafi - responsible for the decrees which banned women from higher education in Afghanistan.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

For this city is home to a celebrated regiment that bears its name and has been in the forefront of all the main battles in the Kremlin's campaign against its neighbours.\n\nThe 331st Guards Parachute Regiment, often called the Kostroma Airborne Regiment, has been the subject of investigations by BBC's Newsnight since shortly after last February's invasion. These have revealed the price paid by the regiment and its home community. We had confirmed 39 fatalities by April last year, 62 by late July, and now the toll has reached 94.\n\nMuch of the work compiling this list has involved combing social media accounts on V'Kontakte, the Russian equivalent of Facebook, and local media reporting. We can then cross reference this with satellite and Google Street View imagery.\n\nOne video discovered on V'Kontakte showed soldiers' graves at a cemetery north-east of Kostroma. The graves shown in the videos match the names of the soldiers we have collated.\n\nThe actual number of 331st's dead is probably much higher. Some of the soldiers are from towns outside Kostroma, which makes tracking down information about them much more difficult. Several soldiers have been reported missing - some of these may count among the dead.\n\nWhen one considers those seriously wounded or taken prisoner, it's reasonable to assume that the Ukraine war has cost the regiment several hundred soldiers.\n\nThe loss of life has caused much comment in Kostroma, which lies about 300km (186 miles) north-east of Moscow and has a population of around a quarter of a million. One local website noted last spring that the entire Soviet-Afghan war, lasting nine years, had cost the city 56 soldiers. Heavy losses in Ukraine have given the local authorities a difficult task of political management.\n\nSergey Sitnikov, Kostroma's Kremlin-appointed governor, has been in the forefront of attempts to convince people that the city's soldiers are being properly supported. Gov Sitnikov's visits to hospitals, barracks, and indeed to the front, have been covered on local TV.\n\nOn a visit to the", "crowds around Buckingham Palace. In her bright red, blue and white wig, Heidi Roberts, from Surrey, said she was looking forward to having something to celebrate: \"I think we're all mourning the Queen, and I think it's a bit of a hangover from that.\"\n\nAs the procession began just after 10:20 BST, onlookers along the route erupted in cheers. This was the pageantry they had come for; that and a glimpse of the King and Queen.\n\nThe carriage reached Westminster Abbey and the ceremony began - broadcast to the world and piped to the crowds outside.\n\nThis time the TV pictures were in colour. And social media would curate it for you. On Twitter, Penny Mordaunt - the Conservative MP and leader of the House of Commons, who brandished the Sword of State as part of its presentation to the King - began trending. So too for a time was the republican slogan #NotMyKing.\n\nIn Majorca, British expats and tourists watched on big screens as they sat in the sunshine in novelty crowns. In New York, Iain Anderson, 43, organised a screening at Tea and Sympathy, a British-themed caf\u00e9 and shop.\n\n\"We haven't had the best history after that little war\", he joked, referring to the American Revolution. \"But people still like the history. The theatre of it, the pomp and the circumstance.\"\n\nAt the moment the Archbishop of Canterbury placed the crown on King Charles's head, the sound of popping corks could be heard along The Mall. Soon afterwards, as the carriage returned to Buckingham Palace, there were shouts of \"God Save the King\" and \"hip hip hooray\" from the crowd.\n\nThe appearance of the King and Queen on the palace's balcony - albeit with a scaled-back military flypast due to the weather - was imminent. The barriers were lowered. The crowd rushed to the front.\n\nCheryl Kingbrooks, Joanne Gerrard and her son Ryan were among them. \"We never thought we'd get right to the front,\" Cheryl said afterwards.\n\n\"We were right at the back of The Mall, and then as soon as the gates opened, we just ran down and we didn't realise we'd get that far forward. But we did and it was absolutely amazing,\" Ryan added.\n\nSoon after, the new King and Queen retreated inside. For some it had been a day to immerse themselves in, to be part of, come rain or shine. For others it was something to ignore or even endure. Either way, a new reign had begun.\n\nOne of Scotland's main police control rooms used a fake system to manipulate response time targets for eight years, according to documents seen by the BBC.\n\nThousands of calls to the Bilston Glen control room were allocated to a fictitious call sign known as DUMY.\n\nInternal systems would register that the calls had been passed to officers - but instead they were parked on a list.\n\nThis meant a police vehicle would not have been dispatched quickly to calls which had been judged as high priority.\n\nIt appears that many calls were not attended at all.\n\nThe practice, according to official police documents, was designed to \"provide artificial levels of incident management performance\".\n\nThe documents reveal that the DUMY call sign was used at Bilston Glen in Loanhead, Midlothian, from at least 2007 until the system was discovered in 2015 and stopped.\n\nPolice Scotland said the practice should not have been used after the creation of the national police force in 2013, and was \"permanently discontinued\" in March 2015.\n\nThe practice appears to have ended just four months before the M9 tragedy in July 2015. Lamara Bell and John Yuill died after their car lay undiscovered for three days after a crash, despite police being alerted.\n\nLamara Bell and John Yuill were found inside their car after it crashed down an embankment off the M9\n\nPolice Scotland was criminally prosecuted and admitted that failures in its call handling processes at Bilston Glen contributed to the death of Ms Bell.\n\nThe lawyer who acted for one of the bereaved families has told the BBC they were never told about the DUMY process.\n\nDavid Nellaney, of Digby Brown, said this was information which should have been disclosed to the families.\n\nHe added: \"I'm astonished to be perfectly honest. I think that puts the wider public at risk if calls are not being actioned\u2026 and to not respond to them and put them into a DUMY system whereby there's no guarantee that they'll come back to them, is quite shocking.\n\n\"I think it probably gives an indication of potentially the practices that were going on. When you adopt that type of practice you're bringing in factors such as human error, which have played a part in what happened with Lamara and John.\"\n\nMoi Ali said the system sounded like \"an attempt at deception\"\n\nMoi Ali, who was on the board of the Scottish Police Authority watchdog from 2013 to 2017, said this was the first time she had heard of the system.\n\n\"These are exactly the kind of things that should be flagged to the board so that we can start an internal investigation or inquiry,\" she said.\n\n\"So if that was concealed from us, I find that very, very concerning.\"\n\nTwo heavily-redacted documents were released to BBC Scotland after a lengthy Freedom of Information (FOI) process with Police Scotland.\n\nAn undated official misconduct document says an officer was being disciplined for conduct which \"discredits the Police Service or public confidence in it\".\n\nIt states that staff at Bilston Glen utilised a \"fictitious call sign known as 'DUMY', which had been introduced to prevent the activation of internal alarms and provide artificial levels of incident management performance.\"\n\nEach police car is given a four letter or number call-sign, which is used to allocate the calls which are received by the force.\n\nWhen a call was given to DUMY, the system would recognise that it had been allocated successfully - but instead, these calls were parked on a separate list.\n\nThis would help artificially inflate the centre's call-handling response times.\n\nThese internal targets were not published, but the then Chief Constable Stephen House was known to be target-driven, and staff have previously spoken about the pressure to meet them. Stephen House has been approached for comment.\n\nA report by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary in Scotland (HMICS) - the independent body which scrutinised Police Scotland - highlighted understaffing as one of the issues which contributed to the control room's problems around the time of the M9 crash.\n\nHowever, the HMICS investigation into the call-handling process at Bilston Glen makes no mention of the DUMY system.\n\nA HMICS spokesperson told the BBC its inquiry \"did not include a retrospective inspection of historical practices before this period\" and declined to say whether or not it knew about the practice.\n\nA second briefing document, dated 28 July 2015, reveals that the DUMY practice was in use at the Lothian and Borders force from at least 2007, and continued for two years after the country's regional forces merged into Police Scotland in 2013.\n\nIt states that being placed on the DUMY list would cause the incident \"to go to the bottom of the controller's incident list\".\n\nThe practice was halted briefly in January 2015, when the control system was being upgraded to a new system known as Storm Unity, and the DUMY call sign was no longer available.\n\nBut staff at Bilton Glen \"lobbied\" senior management to re-introduce it to the new system, and this was approved by a senior person whose name and title has been redacted on the documents.\n\nThe DUMY system was up and running for another six weeks before a member of the Glasgow control room noticed and raised the alarm.\n\nIn December last year, the BBC learned that Police Scotland chiefs had been so worried about the DUMY practice that they launched an internal investigation, led by then Ch Supt Paul Anderson.\n\nWe asked Police Scotland, under FOI, to provide a copy of his report. It told the BBC that it \"does not hold a copy of the report requested\".\n\nHowever, Mr Anderson, now a Deputy chief constable at Humberside Police, confirmed to the BBC that he did in fact carry out an investigation, and produced a report.\n\nA spokesman for Mr Anderson told the BBC he \"undertook a review on request of the chief officer team. The review pertained", "from Dartford was said to be \"a bit of a character\"\n\nLeonard Gordon Goodman was born in Farnborough, Kent, on 25 April 1944.\n\nHe grew up in London's East End in an over-crowded two-up, two-down terrace. There was \"lots of love and laughter, but very little money\", he recalled.\n\nIt was a tough neighbourhood. Two of his uncles had been active members of Sir Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists before World War Two. When hostilities broke out, angry crowds attacked the family home in Howard Street. Serious injuries were only prevented when the sound of an air raid siren dispersed the mob.\n\nThe family scraped a living selling vegetables from barrows. Goodman's grandfather Albert pawned his gold watch every Monday morning to buy the week's supply.\n\nLen Goodman grew up in the post-war East End of London\n\nLen watched the old man attract customers with a smooth patter dotted with earthy phrases. He later used many of his grandad's lines on Strictly Come Dancing.\n\nAlbert Goodman was good at his job. The barrow became two shops in Bethnal Green - with enough money left over to buy Len's parents a greengrocer business in Kent.\n\nSoon after they moved, the marriage fell apart. Goodman's father moved away, and his mother buried the shame of divorce by throwing herself into her job.\n\nAt school, young Len enjoyed football and cricket - but was no academic. \"It's obvious you're never going to amount to anything, Goodman,\" his headmaster declared. \"You're a failure in class. You'll be a failure in life.\"\n\nTo help his mother, he pushed a barrow of vegetables around town every evening - just as his grandfather had. This, Goodman believed, was a more valuable education than school had ever provided - as it taught him how to speak to people and engage them.\n\nAt the age of 14, he went to his first dance class. He had little love for the foxtrot, but a keen interest in girls. The most thrilling moment of the night, he later wrote, was the 'excuse me' dance - during which you had to kiss your partner goodbye.\n\nA year later, Goodman left school \"with no sense of loss on either side\". He began an apprenticeship in an engineering factory but, by his own admission, was dreadful at it.\n\nHe took a welding course and found work in the Harland and Wolff Royal docks in Woolwich. It wasn't a job he liked, but it brought in enough money to enjoy himself at weekends.\n\nGoodman became a sharp-dressed Mod, hanging out on his Vespa in Brighton on Saturday afternoons, trying to avoid fisticuffs with gangs of rival Rockers.\n\nLike many of his generation, he worshipped rock 'n' roll and regarded ballroom dancing as something 'old fogeys' did. Then, he broke his metatarsal playing football on Hackney Marshes, and was advised to find an activity to help build its strength again.\n\nWith his dance partner and first wife, Cherry\n\nJoy Tolhurst was a former world champion. At her first dance lesson, Goodman was hampered by wearing a winklepicker on one foot and a carpet slipper on the other. Slowly, he fell in love with the both the waltz and Mrs Tolhurst's daughter.\n\nHe and Cherry Tolhurst became partners on and off the floor. Their first competition was a Pontin's sponsored event at the Royal Albert Hall. Goodman practiced in his front room, with a lamp placed behind him - so he could see his hip action in the shadows.\n\nLen and Cherry toured the country teaching people how to dance\n\nAs the couple sashayed onto the hallowed stage, Goodman heard great bellows from the audience. Fifty-three fellow dock workers had hired a coach to come and support him, and were well lubricated up.\n\nWhen Joy's husband died suddenly, she asked 22-year-old Len to help her teach. Learning from an ex-welder was a shock to students used to a poised former professional.\n\nA \"10 from Len\" was reserved for the very best dancers\n\nBy 1973, Goodman and Cherry were driving thousands of miles a year, demonstrating the cha-cha-cha and rumba to amateur classes the length and breadth of the country.\n\nThey married and opened their own dance school in Dartford. The couple won a rising star competition in Blackpool - but decided not to compete professionally again.\n\n\"I got fed up with the politics of the business,\" explained Goodman. \"The fact that you had to placate and schmooze people that you didn't really like, because you did not upset them, as they were judges.\"\n\nThe decision took a toll on his marriage which, he admitted, had become more of a dance partnership than a relationship.\n\nWhen the dancing stopped, everything collapsed. Cherry left him for a multi-millionaire Frenchman, leaving Len in an empty house and with only half a business.\n\nHis heartstrings were healed when he met Lesley, a former wife of the manager of Black Sabbath. A year later, the couple had a son.\n\nWhat saved his business was the film Saturday Night Fever.\n\nGoodman put up posters: \"You've heard the music, now learn the dances.\" There were queues halfway down Dartford High Street and, when Grease came out, \"the seam of gold turned into a whole goldmine\".\n\nBy the time the BBC rang to suggest he audition for Strictly Come Dancing, Goodman was about to turn 60. He was settled with his new partner Sue, and their dance school was performing well.\n\nIn truth, he wasn't looking for new challenges. He was hoping to wind down his business and play a little golf. But his competitive instincts kicked in, so Goodman caught the bus to Strictly's studios, wearing his best tweed suit.\n\nRevel Horwood, Phillips and Tonioli all had backgrounds in theatre, but none knew ballroom. Len was concerned that the show might \"take the rise\" out of the discipline he loved - which could destroy his reputation.\n\nTo take part, he had to break a contract to judge the Blackpool championships - which clashed with the first TV show. It wasn't just the BBC that was taking a gigantic risk: Goodman knew he would never be asked again.\n\nGoodman with his fellow judges on ABC's Dancing with the Stars, Carrie Ann Inaba and Bruno Tonioli\n\nHe decided the best thing was just to be himself. In the first show, he trotted out one of his grandad's favourite phrases, \"all sausage, and no sizzle\", and quickly settled in.\n\nThe audience loved his pithy observations. \"It's a lovely rise and fall, up and down like a bride's nightie,\" he told one nervous contestant. \"You're just like a trifle - fruity at the top but a little bit spongy down below,\" he informed another.\n\nAt heart, he was a teacher and was quick to offer practical advice. But one of the show's first brave celebrities, Jason Wood, discovered Goodman had a sharp tongue. \"Wood by name, wood by nature,\" he said.\n\nWith millions watching, the Americans picked up the show. ABC booked Tonioli to appear alongside two US judges on the rebranded Dancing with the Stars - only for history to repeat itself.\n\nDancing was never work for Len Goodman\n\nOne of ABC's picks did not perform well in the pilot programme. With 24 hour's notice, Goodman was put on a plane to Los Angeles.\n\nFor more than a decade, he crossed the Atlantic twice a week - appearing as head judge on both shows simultaneously. While in LA, he shared an apartment complex with Tonioli - with Bruno doing the cooking and Len the ironing.\n\nGoodman's natural charm worked so well on camera that he was offered other presenting opportunities. There was even a short-lived BBC game show, Partners in Rhyme.\n\nBut, in his 70s, he decided the constant flying back and forth had become too much. He left Strictly Come Dancing - with much emotion - in 2016 to concentrate on the (much better paid) ABC version.\n\nThen in 2022, he left the US show to \"spend more time with my grandchildren and family\" in the UK.\n\nInternational fame came late to Len Goodman. When it did, he had spent long enough in obsc", "and love for Katnis.\"\n\nAnna Bennett, a nurse at Walsall Manor Hospital, was visibly shaken as she told of how she tried to help Katnis at the scene.\n\n\"[The crash has] destroyed the community,\" she said.\n\nJade Simkiss, who also tried to help, added: \"Our condolences go to the family and we hope no-one ever has to witness what we witnessed.\"\n\nJade Simkiss (left) and Anna Bennett tried to help the youngster at the scene\n\nPolice said they were looking for a blue and black road bike but were yet to determine the exact make and model.\n\n\"I would urge anyone with any information, however large or small, to make contact with us,\" said Det Sgt Hughes.\n\n\"This is not about protecting people, this is about doing the right thing,\" he added, urging the local community to \"come together\" and work with him.\n\n\"This is a heart-breaking situation that no family should ever go through and my thoughts are with the family of this young girl,\" he said.\n\nCh Supt Phil Dolby added that he and his officers had been \"hugely upset by this needless tragedy\".\n\nThe death has had a \"devastating impact\" on the girl's family, who were being supported by specially trained officers, he said.\n\nThe officer echoed the appeal to help find the bike \"as a matter of urgency\".\n\n\"There's somebody out there who thinks it's acceptable to help hide the bike that killed a seven-year-old, and failed to stop, being driven illegally,\" he said.\n\n\"We were [at the scene] very, very quickly, and there were lots of members of the public. That bike would be in our possession right now but for somebody taking deliberate action, in my view, to frustrate that from happening.\"\n\nResidents had previously complained about youths on motorbikes being a problem in the area.\n\nA number of recent police operations had taken about 30 illegally ridden motorbikes off roads, said Ch Supt Dolby.\n\n\"I want to send a clear message to the public that young people in the area are able to ride these bikes because, in many cases, adults are giving them the bikes to ride,\" he explained.\n\n\"They also bear responsibility for the potential consequences and this needs to stop.\"\n\nThe seven-year-old girl was found in a critical condition and later died in hospital\n\nWest Midlands Ambulance Service said the girl was in a critical condition when paramedics arrived.\n\n\"She was receiving basic life support and ambulance crews immediately took over to provide advanced life support and trauma care,\" said a spokesperson.\n\nThe seven-year-old was taken to Birmingham Children's Hospital where she died of her injuries, they added.\n\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

All money repaid the moment that I knew about it.\"\n\nMs Solloway, Mr Hoare and Mr Doogan have been approached by the BBC for comment.\n\nIPSA rules state that claims for penalty charges will not be paid to MPs.\n\nThe watchdog, which is also responsible for setting MPs' pay independent of parliament, said that it has changed its expenses process to ensure any future claims will not be paid out.\n\n\"IPSA's checks failed in some cases to identify these claims and some of them were paid. We will contact MPs and ask them to repay, where appropriate,\" a spokesman said.\n\n\"We have changed our process to ensure any future such claims are not paid, and will reiterate the scheme rules to MPs.\"\n\nThe spokesman added that the congestion charge can be claimed by MPs from outside London who drive into central London for work.\n\nBut that would not extend to an approval for expenses claims for fines that are incurred if the congestion charge is not paid on time.\n\nIt comes days after Prime Minister Rishi Sunak decided not to launch an inquiry into Home Secretary Suella Braverman's handling of a speeding offence.\n\nMs Braverman was caught speeding last year, while she was attorney general, and asked officials for advice on arranging a private course to avoid penalty points on her licence. She later accepted a fine and points.\n\nIPSA was established in 2009 after the scandal over MPs' expenses.\n\nSo farewell to Credit Suisse. Founded in 1856, the bank has been a pillar of the Swiss financial sector ever since. Although buffeted by the financial crisis of 2008, Credit Suisse did manage to weather that storm without a government bailout, unlike its rival-turned-rescuer UBS.\n\nMore recently, the marketing face of Credit Suisse has been Switzerland's tennis god Roger Federer. He smiles down from posters at Swiss airports, a symbol of strength, excellence, staying power and reliability.\n\nBut behind the glossy promotion were some big problems. Divisive management, costly exposure to finance company Greensill Capital, which collapsed in 2021, a seedy money laundering case, and waning customer confidence in the last few months, which saw billions being withdrawn from the bank.\n\nAll it took to turn those doubts into a stampede was an apparently off the cuff remark from the Saudi National Bank, which owns almost 10% of Credit Suisse, suggesting it would not be increasing its investment.\n\nCredit Suisse's shares went into free fall, and even a statement of confidence from the Swiss National Bank, and an offer of $50bn (\u00a341bn) in financial support, couldn't stabilise the situation.\n\nHow could this have happened?\n\nAfter the financial crisis 15 years ago Switzerland introduced strict so-called \"too big to fail\" laws for its biggest banks. Never again, went the thinking, should the Swiss taxpayer have to bail out a Swiss bank, as happened with UBS.\n\nBut Credit Suisse is a \"too big to fail\" bank. In theory, it had the capital to prevent this week's catastrophe.\n\nAlso in theory Swiss financial regulators and the Swiss National Bank keep an eye on those systemically important banks and can intervene before disaster strikes.\n\nIt was odd, last week, to see the rest of the world reacting with real concern as Credit Suisse shares tumbled, and to hear, at first, nothing from Switzerland.\n\nRoger Federer went from winning prize money sponsored by Credit Suisse, to being its marketing figurehead\n\nEven the Swiss media seemed not to notice the headlines over at the Financial Times, and seemed more interested in the continued debate over how much support neutral Switzerland should be offering to Ukraine.\n\nBy the time people did notice, such damage had been done that Credit Suisse was beyond saving. The fallout had begun to threaten not just Switzerland's entire financial sector, but Europe's.\n\nAs the government met in emergency session to try to find a solution, you could almost smell the panic in Bern.\n\nAnnouncing the bank takeover, Swiss President Alain Berset said \"an uncontrolled collapse of Credit Suisse would lead to incalculable consequences for the country and the international financial system\".\n\nIt's hard to avoid the", "al fin of an adult male orca showing tooth rake marks from a fight\n\nThis has resulted in mature, five-tonne male orcas sticking close to - and being very dependent on - their mothers.\n\n\"These sons are really reliant on their mums for their survival,\" said Ms Grimes. \"Mothers will even directly feed their sons salmon that they catch.\n\n\"[So] it could also be that mum is present in a situation of conflict, and can signal to her sons to avoid the risky behaviour they might be participating in.\"\n\nAdult males can weigh up to five tonnes\n\nThe ongoing study of this threatened killer whale population, which lives in the coastal waters between Vancouver and Seattle, was started by Dr Ken Balcomb. Initially, he wanted to examine the threats to their survival, particularly as the population was targeted for capture and sale to some marine parks.\n\nAs well as garnering the southern resident killer whales official protected status, the ensuing years of work and observations went on to reveal insights into killer whale life that could only have come to light through decades of study. The studies have revealed, for example, the vital role of killer whale grandmothers and how much the females sacrifice to support their sons.\n\nProfessor Darren Croft, also from the University of Exeter explained: \"We've got hypotheses, but we need to test them by seeing what's happening under water when these different groups interact. We've learned so much from this population, but we've still got so much to learn from them.\"\n\nMore than 64 million Turks have the right to vote in the run-off\n\nTurks have finished voting in a historic presidential run-off to decide whether or not Recep Tayyip Erdogan should stay in power after 20 years.\n\nHis challenger Kemal Kilicdaroglu, backed by a broad opposition alliance, called on voters to come out and \"get rid of an authoritarian regime\".\n\nThe president, who is favourite to win, promises a new era uniting the country around a \"Turkish century\".\n\nBut the more pressing issue is rampant inflation and a cost-of-living crisis.\n\nResults were due to emerge on Sunday evening, some after polls closed at 17:00 (14:00 GMT)\n\nOutside a polling station early on Sunday one woman of 80 had set her alarm for 05:00 to be sure of arriving on time.\n\nTurnout in the first round was an impressive 88.8%, and Mr Erdogan's lead was 2.5 million votes. That is why both candidates have their eye on the eight million who did not vote - but could this time.\n\nAhead of the run-off Mr Kilicdaroglu accused his rival of foul play, by blocking his text messages to voters while the president's messages went through. After voting in Ankara he urged Turks to protect the ballot boxes.\n\nOpposition parties are deploying an army of some 400,000 volunteers in a bid to ensure no vote-rigging takes place, both at polling stations and later at the election authority. But among the volunteers, they need lawyers such as Sena to accompany the ballot boxes.\n\nMy parents say we used to trust the results and we didn't need any volunteers. It's bad that we don't trust the state, but the state can only change if people force it to\n\nInternational observers spoke of an uneven playing field after the first round. But there was no suggestion that any irregularities in voting would have changed the result.\n\nAs he voted in Istanbul, President Erdogan said Turkish democracy was going through a second round in a presidential election for the first time and suggested Turks should make use of it.\n\nMr Kilicdaroglu promised a very different style of presidency on his final day of campaigning: \"I have no interest in living in palaces. I will live like you, modestly... and solve your problems.\"\n\nKemal Kilicdaroglu voted with his wife Selvi in Ankara\n\nIt was a swipe at Mr Erdogan's enormous palatial complex on the edge of Ankara which he moved to when he switched from prime minister to president in 2014. After surviving a failed coup in 2016 he took on extensive powers, detained tens of thousands of people and took control of the media.\n\nSo it was laden with symbolism when he paid a campaign visit on Saturday to the mausoleum of a prime minister executed by the military after a coup in 1960.\n\n\"The era of coups and juntas is over,\" he declared, linking Turkey's current stability to his own authoritarian rule.\n\nPresident Erdogan and his wife Emine voted at a school in Istanbul\n\nTurkey, however, is deeply polarised, with the president reliant on a support base of religious conservatives and nationalists, while his opposite number's supporters are mainly secular - but many of them are nationalist too.\n\nFor days the two men traded insults. Mr Kilicdaroglu accused the president of cowardice and hiding from a fair election; Mr Erdogan said his rival was on the side of \"terrorists\", referring to Kurdish militants.\n\nBut after days of inflammatory rhetoric about sending millions of Syrian refugees home, the opposition candidate returned to Turkey's number-one issue - the economic crisis, and in particular its effect on poorer households.\n\nA 59-year-old woman and her grandson joined him on stage to explain how her monthly salary of 5,000 lira (\u00a3200; $250) was now impossible to live on as her rent had shot up to 4,000 lira (\u00a3160; $200).\n\nIt may have been staged, but this is the story across Turkey, with inflation at almost 44% and salaries and state help failing to keep pace.\n\nEconomists say the Erdogan policy of cutting interest rates rather than raising them has only made matters worse.\n\nThe Turkish lira has hit record lows, demand for foreign currency has surged and the central bank's net foreign currency reserves are in negative territory for the first time since 2002.\n\n\"The central bank has no foreign currency to sell,\" says Selva Demiralp, professor of economics at Koc University. \"There are already some sort of capital controls - we all know it's hard to buy dollars. If they continue with low interest rates, as Erdogan has signalled, the only other option is stricter controls.\"\n\nEast of Ankara, gleaming tower blocks have been springing up in Kirikkale. It looks like boom-time for this city, run by the president's party.\n\nBut many people here are struggling.\n\nFatma has run a hairdresser's for 13 years but for the past two, work has dried up, and the cost of rent and hair products has soared.\n\nShe voted for an ultranationalist candidate who came third, and does not trust the two men left in the race.\n\nA few doors up the street, Binnaz is working a sewing machine at a shop for mending clothes.\n\nPeople cannot afford new dresses so she is earning much more, even if her monthly rent has trebled to to 4,000 lira. Despite Turkey's stricken economy, she is putting her faith in the president.\n\nI believe [Erdogan] can fix it because he's been in power for 21 years and he has all the power. It's his last term [in office] so he'll do all he can for us\n\nOutside a supermarket, Emrah Turgut says he is also sticking with Mr Erdogan because he has no faith in the other option, and believes the president's unfounded allegations that the biggest opposition party co-operates with terrorists.\n\nTurkey's second-biggest opposition party, the HDP, denies any link to the militant PKK, but President Erdogan has used their backing for the rival candidate to suggest a link to terrorists.\n\nWhoever wins on Sunday, Turkey's parliament is already firmly in the grip of Mr Erdogan's Islamist-rooted AK Party and its far-right nationalist ally, the MHP.\n\nThe AKP also has the youngest MP, who arrived in parliament on the eve of the presidential vote.\n\nZehranur Aydemir, 24, believes that, if Mr Erdogan wins, then he will lay the foundations for a century in which Turkey will become a global power: \"Now Turkey has", "the detained Americans would be a complex prisoner swap for Krasikov needing the cooperation of Germany, the US and Russia.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, German politician Roderich Kiesewetter said the deal would force Berlin into \"hostage diplomacy\". So why does Putin seem so desperate to get Krasikov back?\n\nThe first clues of a possible Kremlin hand in the Berlin murder come from Krasikov's background - or rather, the lack of one.\n\nDocuments obtained by the Bellingcat investigative website show he was wanted over the 2013 Moscow murder. However, two years later, the arrest warrant was withdrawn and the \"Vadim Krasikov\" identity seemingly vanished into thin air.\n\nThat is when \"Vadim Sokolov\", age 45, appeared. In 2015 he got a passport, and, in 2019, a tax identification number.\n\nA German court concluded that this documentation could only be sanctioned by the Kremlin, and therefore that Vadim Krasikov had state support for the Berlin murder.\n\n\"Russian state authorities ordered the accused to liquidate the victim,\" a German presiding judge said after sentencing Krasikov to life in prison.\n\nGermany expelled two Russian diplomats in response to the murder of Zelimkhan Khangoshvili\n\nHis victim, Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, was a Chechen rebel commander between 2000 and 2004, when Chechnya was fighting a war of independence against Russia.\n\nTo Western observers, Mr Khangoshvili seemed likely to be part of a string of Moscow-ordered assassinations of Chechen exiles in Europe and the Middle East.\n\nThe Kremlin denied orchestrating the Berlin murder, and dismissed the verdict against Krasikov as \"politically motivated\".\n\nHowever, in his Tucker Carlson interview, President Putin appeared to make an admission when he said negotiations were under way for an exchange involving a Russian \"patriot\" who had \"eliminated a bandit\" in a European capital.\n\nUlrich Lechte, who sits on the German government's foreign affairs committee, told the BBC that President Putin's desire to retrieve Krasikov is \"a clear admission of guilt and shows how unscrupulously and unchallenged Russia has been able to act in our country\".\n\nVadim Krasikov belonged to the highly secretive 'Vympel' unit of Russia's secret service, the FSB, according to prosecutors at his trial.\n\n\"Its official remit is counter-terrorism operations at home, but it has in many ways returned to its original roots, as a unit tasked with covert 'wet-work' - sabotage and assassination - abroad,\" Putin historian and Russian security expert Mark Galeotti told the BBC.\n\nKrasikov personally met Putin at a target shooting range while serving with Vympel, owned a BMW and Porsche, and travelled for work regularly, according to an interview his brother-in-law gave The Insider.\n\nAn association between Krasikov and the FSB would provide one explanation for why Vladimir Putin, a former foreign intelligence officer himself, would be willing to hand over a prisoner of the value of Evan Gershkovich.\n\nBut Mark Galeotti said a potential deal says more about Russia's social contract with agents abroad than the value of Krasikov individually.\n\n\"It [Russia] says 'look, if you do get caught, we will get you back, one way or the other. It may take a long time, but we will get you back',\" Mr Galeotti said. \"That's very important for getting people to put themselves in potentially very dangerous situations.\"\n\nBut whether Krasikov will ever be allowed back to Russia is ultimately up to the German government.\n\nThe BBC approached three members of the government's foreign affairs committee, all of whom oppose releasing Krasikov.\n\nUlrich Lechte, whose Free Democratic Party is part of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's government, insisted that Germany \"must not do Russia this favour\".\n\n\"This is a kind of amnesty and sends the political signal that Russia can commit further murders on our territory, which will then be released and thus remain unpunished,\" Mr Lechte told the BBC.\n\nPoliticians on Germany's foreign affairs committee say Zelimkhan Khangoshvili's murder was \"state terrorism\"\n\n\"It must not be allowed to prevail that foreign citizens are arbitrarily arrested in order to abuse them for a prisoner exchange.\"\n\nJ\u00fcrgen Hardt, from the Christian Democrats, said he \"didn't see any political support\" for rumoured prisoner swaps involving Krasikov.\n\nEven if there was political will in Berlin to release Krasikov, the legal mechanics which could make that happen are murky.\n\nHe could be pardoned by the president, or deported to serve the remainder of his sentence in Russia - something that almost certainly wouldn't happen in light of Putin's comments.\n\nOne case in point is the Russian \"Merchant of Death\", Viktor Bout, an infamous arms dealer released from US custody as part of a prisoner exchange with US basketball star Brittney Griner. Bout has now pivoted to politics and won a seat at a local election in Russia.\n\nA protest against the Putin regime was held in Berlin during the Russian election.\n\nNicola Bier, a German lawyer focusing on extradition law, told the BBC there is \"no legal mechanism that is really designed for this particular situation\", so any move would be highly controversial and political.\n\nAnti-Kremlin political activist Bill Browder is now compiling a list of more than 50 Russian prisoners in Western countries who could be used as bargaining chips to free activists and journalists detained in Russia.\n\nBrowder hopes the effort could help release British-Russian journalist Vladimir Kara-Murza, sentenced to 25 years in jail for treason for speaking out against the war in Ukraine, as well as Evan Gershkovich.\n\nAsked by the BBC whether his campaign played into \"hostage diplomacy\", Browder conceded it is \"far from ideal\", but necessary to save lives.\n\nAfter Alexei Navalny's death, Browder said, \"it's clear that other hostages are at risk of dying\".\n\nBrian Harman overcame an early wobble to stroll serenely to his first major title with a six-shot victory at the 151st Open Championship in Hoylake.\n\nA one-under 70 proved more than enough for the American, who finished on 13 under at a rain-soaked Royal Liverpool.\n\nWorld number three Jon Rahm finished joint second on seven under with Sepp Straka, Tom Kim and Jason Day.\n\nRory McIlroy ended six under, while Matthew Jordan and Tommy Fleetwood were England's best, tied on four under.\n\nIt has been a fairytale week for Jordan, who was on the Royal Liverpool chipping green at the age of three and became a member aged seven.\n\nThe R&A gave him the honour of hitting the opening tee shot on Thursday and he birdied the last to card a one-under-par final round on Sunday that lifted him into the top 10 and qualifies him for next year's Open at Royal Troon in Ayrshire.\n\n\"Normally I just see players on TV and think 'that'd be cool if it happened to me',\" he told BBC Sport.\n\n\"It was just the perfect finish to what has been the most unbelievable week.\"\n\nIt has also been a fairytale week for Harman. The 36-year-old, ranked 26th in the world, becomes just the third left-hander to win the Claret Jug - emulating Bob Charles in 1963 and Phil Mickelson in 2013.\n\nThe victory, which saw him collect \u00a32.3m, is just the third in his career, and first since 2017.\n\nAnd he did it by plotting his way round the links in superb fashion. He only went in two bunkers all week - one of them on the 72nd - holed 59 out of 60 putts from inside 10 feet and had no three putts, statistics that help make champions.\n\n\"I knew I had a six-shot lead on the 18th, I was ready to putt it down that fairway,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\n\"To get it done on the biggest stage, it's what you dream about as a kid.\n\n\"I've always thought about holding this trophy.

Is the evidence against the tabloid stacking up?\n\nAt times during the hacking court case it seemed as though we had travelled back in time, to the days before social media, when people got their news from pages of ink, printed on actual paper.\n\nBack to the 1990s and 2000s, when stories about Prince Harry - barely out of school and falling for his first girlfriends - could fill newspapers day after day.\n\nThe tabloids were also fascinated by soap stars. Two Coronation Street actors were claimants in this trial. Michael Turner played mechanic Kevin, and Nikki Sanderson, hairdresser Candice.\n\nThe fourth claimant was Fiona Wightman, dragged into the red-tops by her marriage to Paul Whitehouse, whose TV comedy sketches on The Fast Show had catapulted him to fame in the 90s.\n\nActors Michael Turner, known by his stage name Michael Le Vell (left), and Nikki Sanderson (right) were also claimants\n\nWhat became clear during the trial was Mirror journalists didn't just make up their stories as many critics of the tabloids might believe. They pursued accurate reporting of celebrity secrets as vigorously as another journalist might investigate a corrupt politician.\n\nBut their most precious commodity was sensitive personal information, some of it obtained illicitly from phone hacking. This is no longer disputed by the newspapers, because this trial was not the first.\n\nIn 2015, the publisher of the Mirror, Sunday Mirror and People (now known as Reach PLC) admitted journalists used phone hacking and other unlawful methods during a previous landmark case, brought by another Coronation Street actor, Shobna Gulati and others.\n\nThe High Court judge, Mr Justice Mann, ruled that for seven years, from 1999, there had been \"widespread, institutionalised and long-standing\" phone hacking at the newspapers and editors knew - in particular, the editor of the Sunday Mirror, Tina Weaver. The publisher apologised.\n\nTina Weaver, who led the Sunday Mirror for 11 years, gave evidence at the Leveson Inquiry into press ethics in 2012\n\nIn the latest trial, which concluded on Friday, the claimants were trying to expand the legal action to more potential victims, and prove the scandal reached the top of Mirror Group - to its board and its lawyers. If Mr Justice Fancourt finds they knew - and did nothing - the company could be hit with massive bills for compensation.\n\nDuring this trial, the claimants attempted to make a new case against Piers Morgan, the television presenter who was Mirror editor between 1995 and 2004, who had emerged largely unscathed from the 2015 trial.\n\nThey brought together a series of incidents, which they said suggested he knew quite a lot about phone hacking and blagging - the reckless obtaining of personal information such as addresses, phone bills or bank statements - in the hope of creating an unbreakable thread of evidence.\n\nThere was the lunch where Mr Morgan urged a phone company executive to tell his customers they should change the PIN numbers on their mobiles, because journalists could listen to their voicemail messages.\n\nThere was the former intern who told the court he overheard a journalist reassuring Mr Morgan that a story about the singer Kylie Minogue was accurate because it had come from her voicemails.\n\nA former Guardian journalist who said in a statement that Mr Morgan had explained to him most people didn't change the default access code for their voicemails, so they were easy to guess.\n\nAnd the agent for TV presenter Ulrika Jonsson, who couldn't work out why Mr Morgan seemed to know so much about her client.\n\nBut neither side called Mr Morgan to the witness box to defend himself. In civil trials, witnesses only tend to be called if they can help one side or the other. The Mirror Group argued Mr Morgan's appearance would have been an \"unnecessary distraction\" from the issues the judge has to decide.\n\nRemember, a key question was what executives knew. Piers Morgan was not on the board of Mirror Group Newspapers, the company said, and only attended two meetings over nine years.\n\nBut towards the end of the hearings, the judge put Mr Morgan at the top of a list of 29 journalists who hadn't come to court and perhaps \"could and should\" have given evidence.\n\nAfter all, Mr Justice Fancourt pointed out, the former editor had been happy to talk about phone hacking outside court.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: \"I've never hacked a phone, I wouldn't even know how\" - Piers Morgan (interview filmed in March 2023)\n\nMr Morgan recently told the BBC: \"I never hacked a phone. I wouldn't even know how. I never told anybody to hack a phone.\"\n\nHe also insisted he didn't know phone hacking was going on, but also that he couldn't be sure stories hadn't been published which used unlawful methods.\n\nBut will the judge \"draw an inference\" that Mr Morgan not giving evidence suggests he was involved? He could decide he doesn't have to make any ruling at all about the former editor.\n\nSo what else did we learn? The trial lifted the lid on a network of private investigators, or PIs, who specialised in feeding personal information to the tabloids.\n\nFor the first time, a handful appeared in court. Ageing veterans of the information trade, sometimes scoffing at the questions they faced, sometimes confused by them.\n\nBetween 1996 and 2011 the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and People spent at least \u00a39m in payments to PIs. We heard that reporters on the Mirror papers regularly subcontracted the process of obtaining information to these PIs.\n\nA reporter might get one to find an address and phone number from credit reference agencies, or from the Electoral Roll, potentially breaching data protection laws.\n\nIt was claimed journalists might use these details to hack a celebrity's phone themselves, or pass them onto another specialist investigator, who would in turn know the right \"blagger\" able to get more information.\n\nThere were people who would pose as bank customers to get financial records, or NHS staff to obtain someone's medical status. Some were experts at digging through credit records, others at digging through rubbish. Literally, the contents of celebrity bins.\n\nThe information would then be passed back up the chain, and presented to the reporter. The claimants argued this would allow the journalist to say it had been provided by \"sources\", and to deny knowing it had potentially been obtained unlawfully.\n\nQuotes lifted from phone hacking would be written up as the words of anonymous \"insiders\" to disguise their source, the court heard.\n\nMirror Group's barrister, Andrew Green KC, accepted there were some investigators who broke the law - \"rotters\" as he called them several times. But most of the time they were using legitimate databases, he said.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex gave evidence in the hacking trial in June\n\nThe three alleged victims of \"unlawful information gathering\" were chosen as test cases. Prince Harry picked himself as the fourth by simply refusing to settle with the Mirror.\n\nTheir time in the witness box was mainly spent defending their cases against Mr Green. He tried to get them to accept that the stories the newspapers published about them must have come from publicly available sources, from friends, \"insiders\", other newspapers or even interviews they had willingly given.\n\nHe argued the four cases had been \"wildly overstated\" and, in the case of Prince Harry, it was \"entirely speculative\". Unlike the 2015 case, Mr Green added, there was very little evidence phones were hacked or that information was unlawfully obtained.\n\nPrince Harry's approach in the witness box was to suppress his anger and suggest it was for the journalists to explain how they got their stories about him.\n\nPrince Harry's lawyer says newspaper coverage of his client and ex-girlfriend Chelsy Davy meant \"they were never alone\"\n\nAt the time, he didn't read all 33 articles in", "-year trial - announced in April 2022 - would see some asylum seekers sent to Rwanda on a one-way ticket, to claim asylum there.\n\nThey may be granted refugee status to stay in Rwanda. If not, they can apply to settle there on other grounds, or seek asylum in another \"safe third country\".\n\nThe government says the plan will deter people arriving in the UK through \"illegal, dangerous or unnecessary methods\", such as on small boats which cross the English Channel.\n\nA government spokesperson told the BBC: \"Our ground-breaking Migration and Economic Development Partnership will see those who make dangerous and illegal journeys to the UK relocated to Rwanda, where they will be supported to build new lives.\n\n\"Rwanda is a safe and secure country, with a track record of supporting asylum seekers.\"\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese outside Downing Street in March\n\nAustralia PM Anthony Albanese has backed his country's cricket team amid the Jonny Bairstow Ashes controversy.\n\nAustralia won the match after the English batsman left his position in the second test, apparently thinking the over had ended.\n\nBritish PM Rishi Sunak agreed with the England captain's claim that Australia \"broke the spirit of cricket\" in taking the contentious wicket.\n\nBut Mr Albanese said the country stands \"right behind\" its team.\n\n\"Same old Aussies - always winning!\" the prime minister tweeted, referring to the Australian side's two consecutive Test wins so far. His phrase also appeared to be a jibe at English fans who chanted \"same old Aussies always cheating\" after Bairstow was dismissed.\n\nSome of Australia's best-known politicians were also at Lord's Cricket Ground in London that match, including the nation's second longest-serving Prime Minister John Howard.\n\nAustralian team captain Pat Cummins has maintained the Bairstow wicket was fair and within the rules.\n\nBut while his England counterpart Ben Stokes agreed Bairstow was out, Stokes said he would not have wanted to win a match \"in that manner\".\n\nThe debate over the Bairstow wicket has ramped up the consistently fierce rivalry between Australia and England during an Ashes Test series.\n\nEngland fans were criticised for their behaviour at the member's club at Lord's on Saturday when a crowd heckled and yelled abuse at the Australian team players as they filed past after the match.\n\nFollowing complaints from the Australian side, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) - which owns Lord's - issued an apology and said it had suspended three members over the incident.\n\nOn Tuesday, further footage emerged of Australian batsman Usman Khawaja, a Muslim player of Pakistani heritage, being taunted and jeered at by English members in the crowd.\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald newspaper reported Khawaja had been \"repeatedly singled out for abuse\" in the room, and published a video showing Khawaja reacting to the crowd and pointing out hecklers to a security guard.\n\nHe described the comments as \"disrespectful\" and \"really disappointing\".\n\nAustralian captain Cummins also said members were \"quite aggressive and abusive towards some of our players\".\n\nThe Sydney paper reported that sources close to the England Cricket Board have denied any of the MCC investigations into the confrontation relate to racial abuse.\n\nThe incident comes less than a week after a landmark report into British cricket found racism, sexism, classism and elitism \"widespread\" in all levels of the English and Welsh cricket game.\n\nSpeaking after the second test, Australian captain Cummins also accused the English team of hypocrisy in game tactics - as match footage showed Bairstow trying to stump Australian batters in the same manner two days prior to the final day incident.\n\nAustralia has taken a two-nil lead in the Ashes against England, after winning the second test by 43 runs. There are three more tests to go.\n\nVanMoof, the Dutch high-end electric bike-maker, has gone bust after the brothers who founded it were unable to save the firm.\n\nVanMoof, which claims to have 190,000 customers worldwide, was declared bankrupt by the Amsterdam District Court on Tuesday.\n\nThe firm saw demand for its bikes grow during the pandemic and raised millions of dollars to fund expansion.\n\nBut its stores have now been closed and online orders have stopped.\n\nAdministrators are looking at whether VanMoof can be saved by selling its assets or restructuring its debts.\n\nVanMoof was founded in 2009 by Dutch brothers Taco and Ties Carlier who wanted to make \"the perfect city bike\".\n\nThe bikes, which start at around \u00a32,000, are known for their modern, sleek design with a battery built into the frame.\n\nDuring the pandemic, bike sales in general soared and VanMoof as a brand took off.\n\nThe firm raised $128m (\u00a398m) from investors to expand, at the time describing itself \"most funded e-bike company in the world\".\n\nHowever, according to reports there were problems with the firm's newer models and it was struggling to shoulder the costs of repairs.\n\nThere were also reports of long delivery times for bikes and a shortage of parts.\n\nIn an email to staff, published by The Verge, Taco and Ties Carlier said: \"Over the last weeks Ties and I have tried to find a future for VanMoof.\n\n\"We're extremely sorry to have to report that despite our best efforts we did not succeed and we have had to file for bankruptcy.\"\n\nVanMoof, which has around 700 employees, mainly sells its bikes online but also has shops in 20 cities worldwide, and service hubs in 50 cities.\n\nA spokesperson for VanMoof told the BBC: \"The trustees are continuing to assess the situation at VanMoof and are investigating the possibilities of a re-start out of bankruptcy by means of an asset sale to a third party, so that the activities of VanMoof can be continued.\"\n\nThe bankruptcy currently only affects the firm's Dutch business, not its international subsidiaries. VanMoof said it was unsure what would happen to stores outside of the Netherlands but that its \"intention is to keep these entities running as usual\".\n\nIts London and Paris shops are shut, according to its website. It also said:\n\nIt told customers that their e-bikes will not stop working, adding that the firm aimed to keep its app and servers online and secure \"ongoing services for the future\".\n\nIt advised owners to download their e-bike's unique digital key, in case online servers go down.\n\nThe northern Indian state of Himachal Pradesh has been witnessing heavy rainfall over the last few days causing flooding and landslides in the hilly terrain.\n\nThe gushing water is sweeping away bridges, homes and cars, and is causing widespread devastation in the state.\n\nThe neighbouring Uttarakhand state is in a similar situation and water levels of several rivers in the region have crossed the danger mark.\n\nMore than a dozen people have died in the past three days across north India due to the rains.\n\nAerial images show damage caused by a fire underneath the I-95 highway in Philadelphia in the US.\n\nThe blaze was caused by an oil tanker on fire under the bridge according to local officials.\n\nThe partial collapse of the busy elevated freeway affected four lanes.

The impact of the 7.4 magnitude earthquake in Taiwan\n\nWhen disasters happen, particularly when big earthquakes strike, the world's media is drawn like flies to the most dramatic destruction. It is understandable. But it often portrays a distorted picture of what has happened.\n\nYou can see it here in the city of Hualien. Camera teams are crowded around a 10-storey building leaning over at a terrifying angle. It all looks bizarre and scary. But that was only one of a handful of buildings which suffered structurally, in a city of tens of thousands.\n\nA hundred metres away beyond the police cordon, the streets of Hualien look entirely normal. Shops and caf\u00e9s are open, traffic is flowing. Drive through the city and if you didn't know a big quake had struck days ago, you wouldn't guess it.\n\nThe fact that this city has survived largely unscathed has sparked immediate discussion of how and why.\n\nJust over a year ago, we saw earthquakes of about the same magnitudes striking Turkey and Syria, causing the deaths of more than 50,000 people. These countries, of course, had far fewer resources. But when a much smaller 6.7 magnitude quake hit the city of Christchurch in New Zealand in 2011, almost the entire city centre was flattened.\n\nTaiwan is also often on the fault lines, but it has made significant progress in coping with shakes. Many say the wake-up call was Taiwan's 1999 Chi Chi earthquake - the worst in its history. It caused the deaths of more than 2,400 people and destroyed tens of thousands of buildings.\n\nI witnessed the aftermath of that disaster. In the central county of Nantou many apartment buildings had been toppled. What was most striking was how many of them were brand new.\n\nI remember a huge 20-storey building that had snapped off at its foundations and was lying flat on its side - still almost completely intact.\n\nThe catastrophic damage prompted a lot of anger and soul-searching about why so many brand new buildings had failed. Experts said their design was fundamentally flawed. The base pillars were not big enough, the amount of steel in them too small.\n\nTheir findings won't have been entirely a surprise: when I lived in Taipei in the 1990s, there were repeated construction scandals.\n\nThe loss of life in the 1999 earthquake triggered a public outcry and demands for stronger action\n\nA building I lived in as a student was condemned after it was found to have been built with concrete made with sea sand. Sea sand is much cheaper than river sand, but has a much higher saline content. That corrodes the steel reinforcement bars, causing concrete cancer.\n\nWe were told even a medium-level quake could have brought the building down. Another investigation by the Taipei city mayor found old oil cans had been placed inside the concrete pillars of a new building.\n\nThe construction company was accused of using this trick to skimp on concrete and increase its profit.\n\nA lot has changed since then. Following the Chi Chi quake, building codes were changed.\n\nAll new buildings are now required to meet a basic earthquake resistance level that means they can withstand a certain level of shaking without major structural failures.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. BBC Asia Correspondent Rupert Wingfield-Hayes reports on the hundreds of landslides unleashed by the quake\n\nThe government is also constantly revising the quake resistance levels required of buildings - identifying those that need upgrading. After 1999, they carried out a sweep of seismic retrofitting - that typically involved adding a framework of steel beams to a building's exterior, or adding reinforcements like extra pillars. That applied to infrastructure like bridges too.\n\nProf Yih-Min Wu at the National Taiwan University, who has worked in the country's response and prevention departments for decades, says: \"Taiwan is hit so frequently by dangerous earthquakes [that] most of the poor quality buildings are already gone.\"\n\nAnd corrupt construction practices are prosecuted. Following the Tainan earthquake in the island's south-west in 2016, when a 17-storey high-rise collapsed killing dozens, five people involved in the building's construction were prosecuted and jailed.\n\nOf the 10 deaths reported so far this week, only one tragic loss of life occurred due to a collapse of a building - that 10-storey building in Hualien I mentioned earlier. The others were associated with landslides and rockfalls.\n\nAnd that points to another main reason for why Taiwan this time saw limited damage.\n\nLuck played a part. Wednesday's quake began offshore before hitting south of the nearest major population centre, Hualien.\n\nSeismology maps show how the epicentre was 30km (18 miles) to the south of the city, so Hualien and its environs were spared the worst shaking.\n\nThis instead happened in the mountains to the south, west and north, where it unleashed huge rock slides, damaging roads and bridges, and tragically, causing deaths.\n\nWednesday's event contrasts with Nantou in 1999, and Turkey and Syria last year, where earthquakes struck very close to densely populated areas.\n\nStill, the 7.4 earthquake was an incredibly powerful event, shaking not only the island but lands beyond that too.\n\nFortunately for Taiwan, this time it was well-prepared.\n\nWith additional reporting by Frances Mao in Singapore\n\nSage Tod", "recession\" but said more interest rate rises were likely as the Bank of England fights to get inflation under control.\n\nThe Bank has raised rates steadily since December 2021, most recently from 4% to 4.25% in March.\n\nAlex Belfield was jailed for five and a half years for stalking four people, including Jeremy Vine\n\nA former BBC radio presenter convicted of stalking Jeremy Vine has agreed to pay damages to the broadcaster.\n\nAlex Belfield was jailed in September for five and a half years for harassing four people online.\n\nThis included the BBC Radio 2 presenter, who launched separate civil action over Belfield's \"campaign of harassment\", the High Court was told.\n\nVine's lawyer said Belfield made false allegations in nine YouTube videos and eight tweets, published in 2020.\n\nGervase de Wilde told Mrs Justice Steyn that Belfield - a former BBC Radio Leeds presenter - posted \"entirely false\" allegations between May and August of that year.\n\nThis included the false claim that Vine was \"seriously and demonstrably dishonest\", because he had \"publicly and repeatedly lied\" about his knowledge of the circumstances in which the BBC donated \u00a31,000 towards a memorial fund for radio executive John Myers.\n\nMr Myers, who died in June 2019, was one of Vine's \"closest friends\", the court was told.\n\nMr de Wilde said Belfield also sought to obtain \"private information concerning [Vine]\", including the phone numbers of family and friends, \"for the purposes of publishing and disclosing that information online\".\n\nThe court heard Belfield also encouraged members of the public to contact Vine during his broadcasting work and during \"his day-to-day life\".\n\n\"[Vine] was also made deeply upset and anxious by the defendant's harassment of him, and he became concerned for the safety of his family,\" Mr de Wilde said.\n\nVine allowed Belfield to cross-examine him during the criminal trial\n\nGiving evidence during Belfield's separate criminal trial, Vine said \"the saddest thing\" was when one of Belfield's followers called him a \"thieving toe-rag\" under a Facebook tribute to his late father, who died with Parkinson's disease in 2018.\n\nVine described the harassment as \"like an avalanche of hatred you get hit by\", and \"absolutely Olympic-level stalking, even for broadcasting\".\n\nBelfield was convicted of stalking BBC Radio Northampton presenter Bernard Spedding, known as Bernie Keith, and videographer Ben Hewis.\n\nIn relation to Vine and theatre blogger Philip Dehany, Belfield was found guilty of two lesser offences of \"simple\" stalking, which does not require serious alarm or distress to be proved.\n\nBelfield was found not guilty of stalking Rozina Breen, Liz Green, Helen Thomas and Stephanie Hirst.\n\nMr de Wilde said following Belfield's criminal conviction, Belfield accepted \"the defamatory and seriously harmful allegations of dishonesty which he made against [Vine] are entirely false\".\n\nBelfield, he said, had \"agreed to pay [Vine] substantial damages, as well as his legal costs, and to give undertakings subject to a penal notice in respect of future publications and conduct concerning [Vine]\".\n\nThe exact amount has not been disclosed.\n\nAlan Robertshaw, representing Belfield, originally from Mapperley in Nottingham, added: \"He wishes to apologise unreservedly for the damage and distress caused to [Vine] and his reputation by his publications and express his profound and unreserved regret for all of the harm for which he is responsible.\"\n\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

Talks over a bout at Wembley Stadium on 29 April have broken down, despite a late bid to salvage the situation. Usyk had agreed a 70/30 purse split in Fury's favour with terms for a rematch the only outstanding issue. But Warren said the fight is now a \"dead duck\" and suggested Usyk had looked \"for a way to get out\". \"They said the fight must take place before 29 April and if it goes later they want different splits,\" Warren said. \"The reason they did that was they didn't think Tyson would be ready for the 29th and suddenly Tyson was ready for it. \"He has been in training camp for two and a half weeks, got trainers in from America and they looked for a way to get out.\" Fury currently holds the WBC heavyweight belt while Ukraine's Usyk, who beat Britain's Anthony Joshua for a second time last year, has the others in the division. Warren said Fury had agreed to the principle of a rematch but terms around the deal, and whether it would again be for all of the belts, had not been finalised. He said Usyk's camp have also been \"turned\" by potential earnings by fighting in Saudi Arabia later this year by which time Usyk would have to fight other mandatory challengers. \"There is an established rota of who Usyk has to defend against,\" Warren said. \"That's why after the 29th it goes away.\" Both parties have until 1 April to agree a deal after the WBA said it would wait until that date before ordering Usyk to fight mandatory challenger Daniel Dubois. A breakthrough in talks, followed by another obstacle When Fury, 34, beat Derek Chisora in December to retain his WBC title, he said agreeing a deal with Usyk and his team for an undisputed fight would be easy - but that has not proven to be the case. After months of back and forth, Fury publicly declared 12 days ago he would not accept anything less than a 70/30 purse split in his favour. Usyk surprised everyone by accepting that offer, despite holding three of the four world titles, and subsequently informed governing body the WBA that terms had been reached.\n\u2022 None Are Prince Naseem Hamed's sons coming for his crown?\n\u2022 None Is Ricky Gorman the next Tyson Fury? However, Fury then said he would not sign any deal that included a rematch clause - leading to a conference call on Sunday morning between all parties. Warren said \"six or seven\" outstanding issues were ironed out and he had managed to convince Fury to accept a rematch. The WBC champion agreed and the call ended with Team Fury optimistically preparing an official statement to announce the fight. Warren teased on Twitter on Sunday that news was imminent, but the two sides again clashed over the proposed terms of a rematch. According to Warren, Fury was against an immediate rematch in part as he did not want to be tied into two fights against Usyk as he was with Deontay Wilder, which meant he could not fight British rival Anthony Joshua. The purse splits for a proposed rematch appear, however, to be the key unresolved issue to unlocking Fury v Usyk. 'Why are we even talking about rematches?' Usyk, the WBA (Super), IBF, WBO and Ring magazine champion, would like a proposed rematch to happen in November or December, but there are fears among Team Fury that the four belts would have fractured by then. WBC president Mauricio Sulaiman contacted the Fury camp on Wednesday to say the governing body could not guarantee its support for an immediate rematch. Usyk, 36, wants a rematch clause like the one Joshua activated when they fought in 2021. The Briton was given the chance to immediately regain the titles and Usyk would want the same opportunity if he was beaten by Fury. But if the Ukrainian overcame Fury in their first fight, he would also expect an improved purse split in a rematch. There has not been an undisputed heavyweight champion since 1999 when Lennox Lewis beat Evander Holyfield - and never been one in the four-belt era.\n\u2022 None Enter the world of the social media personality\u2019s multi-level marketing scheme and webcam business\n\u2022 None The rise and fall of the jeweller-", "\u2022 None First images of Titan sub as it is brought ashore\n\nNew evidence of China's spy balloon programme - including flights over Japan and Taiwan - has been uncovered by BBC Panorama.\n\nJapan has confirmed balloons have flown over its territory and said it's prepared to shoot them down in future.\n\nChina has not directly addressed the evidence presented by the BBC.\n\nUS-China relations were thrown into turmoil earlier this year, when an alleged Chinese spy balloon was shot down off the US coast.\n\nChina claimed the balloon seen over north-western US in late January was a civilian airship, used for scientific research such as meteorology - and that it was an unintended and isolated event.\n\nJohn Culver - a former East Asia analyst for the CIA - told Panorama that this \"had been not just a one-off, but a continuing effort dating back at least five years.\" He said the Chinese balloons were \"specially designed for these long-range missions\" and some had \"apparently circumnavigated the globe\".\n\nFebruary 2023: US Navy personnel recover the debris from a suspected spy balloon in the North Atlantic\n\nWorking with Synthetaic, an artificial intelligence company which sifted through huge amounts of data captured by satellites, the BBC has found multiple images of balloons crossing East Asia.\n\nThe company's founder, Corey Jaskolski, found evidence of one balloon crossing northern Japan in early September 2021. These images have not been published before.\n\nMr Jaskolski also believes the evidence points to this balloon having been launched from deep inside China, south of Mongolia. The BBC has been unable to confirm this.\n\nJapan is a close ally of the US and more American forces are stationed there than in any other foreign country.\n\nYuko Murakami, from the Japanese ministry of defence, told the BBC that the government was \"taking all precautions to monitor the situation on a daily basis\" and would even be willing to shoot down balloons to protect the \"lives and property of people in the territory of Japan\".\n\nThe US State Department says it believes the Chinese balloons are equipped to gather signals intelligence. It says the aircraft it discovered over the US had \"multiple antennas, likely capable of collecting and geo-locating communications\".\n\nTo investigate whether China had launched other balloons, the Panorama team first searched social media and press reports across the region for sightings of UFOs in the sky.\n\nThey found two photographs taken by Taiwan's weather service, appearing to show a balloon over the capital, Taipei, in late September 2021.\n\nMr Jaskolski then cross-referenced them with satellite imagery. \"Within 90 seconds, we found the balloon off the coast of Taiwan,\" he says.\n\nFrom spy balloons to secret police stations and dissidents on the run, Panorama investigates China's global surveillance operation.

He then fed this outline into his AI software, together with rough coordinates of where it was last seen.\n\nHe also analysed wind models to trace the balloon's path and find its origin.\n\nWorking with satellite images provided by the company Planet Labs, Corey fed all the information into his software, known as RAIC (rapid automatic image categorization), to locate the balloons.\n\nSurveillance balloons are huge - the size of several buses - and carry sophisticated equipment capable of collecting large amounts of data on targets below.\n\nBut photographed by a satellite from space, they appear to be just small white blobs.\n\nMr Jaskolski's research shows that the balloon which flew over the US in February was at one point about 80 miles (130 km) from a nuclear air force base in the state of Montana.\n\nHe also plotted the flight path of the balloon back to its most likely launch site - Hainan Island in the South China Sea.\n\n\"It looks like on the\u2026 launch there was cloud cover,\" he says. \"And if I were going to launch a balloon, I would have chosen a cloudy day in order to minimise that chance of detection.\"\n\nCorey Jaskolski traced the path of the balloon through satellite images such as this one\n\nIn a statement, the Chinese Embassy in London accused the US of itself releasing a large number of high-altitude balloons, which have continuously circled the globe and illegally flown over China's airspace.\n\nIt said that \"China is a responsible country\" which always acts \"in strict compliance with international law and respects all countries' sovereignty and territorial integrity\". It added that it rejects \"unfounded allegations to denigrate and attack China\".\n\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.\n\nLast updated on .From the section Tennis\n\nCoverage: Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. More coverage details\n\nAmerican veteran Venus Williams says a dramatic fall that ruined her hopes of a notable Wimbledon win was \"painful\" and has left her \"in shock\".\n\nWilliams, 43, slipped early in the first-round match against Ukraine's Elina Svitolina, leading to fears she might have to retire injured.\n\nThe five-time champion did continue and pushed Svitolina before losing 6-4 6-3.\n\n\"It was bad luck for me,\" Williams said. \"I can't believe it happened.

Some Israeli media commentators called for Israelis to boycott the airline if an apology was not made.\n\nMr Wilson said that Israel was an \"important partner\" for Ryanair, adding that it was Israel's second-largest airline.\n\n\"We plan to invest in Israel to grow traffic and connectivity both for Israelis travelling to Europe and also to bring much-needed inbound tourism to Israel,\" he said.\n\nIn a letter to Ryanair, the Simon Wiesenthal Center said it had received \"numerous complaints\" about the incident.\n\nIt said after the announcement passengers had asked for a correction, which was refused.\n\nRabbi Abraham Cooper, Simon Wiesenthal Center associate dean, said: \"How would Ryanair react if their flight attendant on a flight to Dublin announced multiple times that passengers would soon be arriving in the UK?\"\n\nHe added: \"Everyone is entitled to their opinions but not to alternative facts.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nVernon Kay began his first day as host of BBC Radio 2's coveted mid-morning slot promising \"more of the same\".\n\n\"Nothing has changed apart from the voice behind the microphone,\" he told BBC Breakfast.\n\nKay, 49, has taken over from veteran broadcaster Ken Bruce, who hosted the weekday programme for 31 years.\n\nBruce's Radio 2 show was the most listened to show in the UK, regularly attracting more than eight million listeners.\n\nHe announced his departure from the BBC in January and started his new mid-morning show on Bauer's Greatest Hits Radio in April.\n\nKay, a former BBC Radio 1 presenter who is married to Strictly Come Dancing host Tess Daly, began the show with U2's Beautiful Day.\n\nHe followed it with Good Times by Chic, which he said he hoped would be a sign of things to come.\n\nVernon Kay started his first show as the mid-morning host on Radio 2\n\nIn his first words to his audience he said that despite broadcasting from London, the city would not be the focus of the show.\n\n\"This show's for you, it's not just about the capital, it's about what's going on in your world,\" he said.\n\nKay also hosted Ten To The Top -

Now the EEFIT team is carrying out technical evaluations of the performance of buildings in the area.\n\nStructural engineers from Turkey, who are working with the team, have already found some problems.\n\nSamples of concrete taken from a collapsed building in Adiyaman have revealed that it contains 6cm-long stones. They have come from a nearby river and have been used to bulk out the concrete.\n\n\"That has some serious implications on the strength of the concrete,\" says Prof So.\n\nSteel reinforcements were smooth not ridged, which weakens the concrete\n\nAnd steel bars inside the concrete, which should reinforce it, have been found to be smooth instead of ridged.\n\nThis means the concrete doesn't cling to them, again weakening the structure.\n\nIn Turkey, many older buildings collapsed during the quake, but some modern ones also failed.\n\nNew building codes were brought in after a major earthquake in Iznit in 1999, and Prof So says newer buildings should have fared better.\n\n\"I think it's really important that we recognise those and actually do the testing, to find out why these new buildings, which would have been built to code, have failed in such a way,\" she told BBC News.\n\nThe EEFIT team is also analysing the nature of the quake.\n\nDr Yasemin Didem Aktas, co-leader of the", "responsible for the content of external sites.\n\nUkrainian refugees living on a cruise ship in Leith have been moved into new accommodation.\n\nMore than 1,000 Ukrainian refugees had been housed on the MS Victoria however, the Scottish government\u2019s contract with Forth Ports ended on Tuesday.\n\nA lack of sufficient accommodation meant that not all people on board could stay in Edinburgh.\n\nPeople without a home to move to will be temporarily housed in hotels, supported by the Scottish government.\n\nOne of the residents, Natalia Pidruchna, told BBC Scotland how she was feeling about the move.\n\nDominic Raab's replacement as deputy PM has insisted that ministers must be able to demand the \"highest standards\" from civil servants.\n\nOliver Dowden said Mr Raab's exit after a bullying inquiry should not stop ministers holding officials to account.\n\nBut he distanced himself from claims from Mr Raab that civil servants were frustrating the work of government.\n\nAnd he admitted the process for dealing with complaints needed to be \"fairer\".\n\nMr Raab stood down on Friday after a report written by lawyer Adam Tolley KC found he was \"intimidating\" and \"aggressive\" towards officials.\n\nHowever, he hit out at the report's findings, saying they set \"a very dangerous precedent\" and would have a \"chilling effect\" on how minsters work.\n\nHe also claimed there was a risk \"a very small minority\" of officials \"with a passive aggressive culture\" were trying to block reforms they did not like.\n\nAsked about Mr Raab's comments on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Mr Dowden said ministers had all \"experienced frustrations\" during their time working with officials in government.\n\nBut he told the show: \"It has not been my experience working with civil servants that we can't work together in a constructive way. I haven't experienced that.\"\n\nHe added: \"What I would not want to become the outcome of this is there is some kind of diminution in the ability of ministers to expect the highest standards\".\n\nHe also said that the government wanted to look at the process for how officials can raise complaints about the behaviour or ministers, saying there was a need to make it \"simpler, fairer and less complex\".\n\nMeanwhile, a Tory peer who is leading a government review of how the civil service operates has called for a more \"robust culture\" in Whitehall.\n\nWriting in the Observer, Lord Maude, a former Cabinet Office minister, raised the prospect of civil servants being able to have more open political affiliations.\n\nHe said ministers have limited authority to put in place officials of their choice despite relying on them and being accountable for what they do.\n\nHe suggested that ministers could be given more say about appointments while preserving impartiality.\n\n\"The UK is now an outlier, and a better balance needs to be struck,\" he said, adding that without change, \"there will be more cases like Raab's when frustrations boil over\".\n\nHe said that other governments with similar systems, such as Australia, New Zealand and Canada, \"manage it better than us\".\n\n\"In France, permanent civil servants often have overt political affiliations, and it causes few problems,\" he added.\n\nLord Maude said that without change there would be more cases like that of Mr Raab\n\nMr Tolley's inquiry looked at eight formal complaints about Mr Raab's behaviour during his previous stints as justice secretary, foreign secretary and Brexit secretary.\n\nHis report concluded Mr Raab's conduct involved \"an abuse or misuse of power\", and that he \"acted in a manner which was intimidating\" and \"persistently aggressive\" towards officials.\n\nThe FDA union, which represents civil servants, dismissed Mr Raab's comments that some officials were frustrating the work of government, accused him of peddling \"dangerous conspiracy theories that undermine the impartiality and integrity of the civil service\".\n\nOn Sunday the Liberal Democrats, who have already called on Mr Raab to step down as an MP, said Prime Minister Rishi Sunak should suspend him as a Conservative MP.\n\nAngela Bassett at the 2023 Oscars, where she lost out on the best supporting actress award to Jamie Lee Curtis\n\nBlack Panther star Angela Bassett will receive an honorary Oscar, 30 years after she was first nominated.\n\nThe actress was nominated for best actress for playing Tina Turner in 1993's What's Love Got to Do with It.\n\nThen this year, she was up for best supporting actress for her role in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever - but looked unimpressed when she lost.\n\nAcademy President Janet Yang said she had given \"transcendent performances that set new standards in acting\".\n\nBassett played Queen Ramonda in the Black Panther films, and is also known for her appearances in films like Boyz N the Hood, Malcolm X, Music of the Heart and Mission: Impossible - Fallout.\n\nHowever, some fans pointed out that she deserved to have won a competitive Oscar. Writing in The Root, Shanelle Genai questioned whether the honorary award was \"some sort of consolation prize\".\n\n\"Angela Bassett has quite literally been out-acting and acting circles around nearly everyone for the last few decades,\" she said.\n\n\"She's your favorite actor's favorite actor, for crying out loud... She deserves more than an honorary anything. She deserves the real thing. She's earned the real thing.\"\n\nJournalist Jerome Trammel said the honorary Oscar was \"insulting\". He wrote on Twitter: \"They're trying to clean up the fact that racism runs deep in that show's process. Calling it honorary leaves a stain that she didn't get it by 'their' standards.\"\n\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences says honorary awards are given for lifetime achievements, exceptional contributions to film, and outstanding service to the Academy.\n\nThe Producers writer and director Mel Brooks will also receive an honorary award\n\nAlso receiving honorary Oscars will be comedy legend Mel Brooks and ET film editor Carol Littleton.\n\nActor, writer and director Brooks, 96, earned his only competitive Oscar to date for best original screenplay for The Producers in 1969. His other hit comedies include Blazing Saddles, High Anxiety and Robin Hood: Men in Tights.\n\n\"Mel Brooks lights up our hearts with his humour, and his legacy has made a lasting impact on every facet of entertainment,\" Ms Yang said.\n\nLittleton's editing credits include Body Heat, The Big Chill, Places in the Heart and The Manchurian Candidate.\n\nThe recipients will be presented with their statuettes at the Governors Awards in November.\n\nThe Sundance Institute's Michelle Satter will also receive the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award for fostering the careers of many film-makers from underrepresented communities.\n\nThe Academy said all four were \"trailblazers who have transformed the film industry and inspired generations of film-makers and movie fans\".\n\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

To be clear, if we are instructed to take to the court to play the 0.3 seconds, we will refuse to do so.\"\n\nThe Panthers were initially told by the National League Committee (NLC) the result would stand as a referee's decision cannot be retrospectively overturned.\n\nHowever, they were given the option to appeal to the National Appeals Committee (NAC).\n\nThe NAC ruled the match should be replayed in its entirety, but Basketball Ireland subsequently said the option to appeal was \"granted in error\".\n\nThe NLC then ruled the fixture would not be replayed in full, but that the remaining 0.3 seconds should be played with the Eagles leading 80-78.\n\n\"We would like to sincerely wish Limerick Sport Eagles, UCD Marian and Tolka Rovers the very best of luck for the remainder of the play-offs,\" added the Panthers.\n\nBasketball Ireland released a statement later on Wednesday confirming \"the matter is now closed\".\n\nMould and a broken toilet were just some of the problems Chiara said she and her family faced in their rented home over the past two years.\n\nBut when the teacher complained to her landlord, she said they responded with a no-fault eviction notice.\n\nIt comes as a survey found tenants in England who complain to landlords were more than twice as likely to get an eviction notice than those who do not.\n\nIt has renewed calls to scrap no-fault evictions, known as Section 21 notices.\n\nThe government pledged to ban the use of Section 21 orders in England last June, but since then the number of households threatened with homelessness because of such notices has increased by 34%.\n\nShelter, a major housing charity, said that scrapping no-fault evictions was more urgent than ever, especially with the number of homes available to rent in the UK dropping by a third over the past 18 months.\n\nChiara told the BBC that she, her husband Ben and their three-year-old daughter Maggie had \"lived with disrepair for two years\" in a flat in Leyton, London.\n\n\"We had moths in the carpet, the cellar was flooded, we had no bath, the toilet broke so we had no toilet,\" she said.\n\nWith mould and damp also causing problems, Chiara complained about the state of the flat to her landlord.\n\n\"They responded with a Section 21, giving us two months' notice to vacate the property,\" she said.\n\n\"We were kicked out because we complained.\"\n\nChiara, who is a teacher in Walthamstow, said that after they got the notice in January, the family experienced a frantic search to find a new home, finally moving into a new place two weeks ago.\n\nShe said while searching they discovered that rents had surged.\n\nChiara said it made it \"pretty much impossible\" for them to find another two-bed flat with a garden, so now the family has moved into a one-bed.\n\nAccording to a YouGov survey of just over 2000 private renting adults in England commissioned by charity Shelter, tenants facing issues with properties who then complained about disrepair to their landlord were more than twice as likely to be handed an eviction notice than those who had not.\n\nThe research found that 76% of private renters in England have experienced disrepair in the last year, and a quarter of renters have not asked for repairs to be carried out due to fear of eviction.\n\n\"We just need to get rid of Section 21,\" said Polly Neate, Shelter's chief executive.\n\nShe added there needed to be a \"situation where landlords can evict people for legitimate reasons, and can't evict them just because they complain about the poor condition of their home\".\n\nDavid and Samira from Richmond in North Yorkshire have had a similar experience to Chiara and her family.\n\nThe couple were issued with a no-fault eviction just before Christmas after complaining about damp.\n\nSamira was six months' pregnant at the time.\n\nDavid said the eviction was \"really unfair\" and caused a lot of stress for the parents-to-be.\n\n\"Looking at the options we had as tenants there was very little we could do. It was just really baffling, really confusing, it doesn't seem like a fair process,\" David added, after being outbid or rejected for more than 30 properties they had viewed.\n\n\"Soul destroying is the term I'd use for it, it was just rejection after rejection after rejection.\"\n\nDavid and Samira managed to find a new home just in time for the arrival of their daughter Aila last week.\n\nThe government is due to introduce a Renters' Reform Bill before the summer, which it has said will redress the balance in the market and provide more security for tenants.\n\nHousing rules are different in each of the devolved nations, and Scotland and Wales have already banned no fault evictions.\n\nThe Wagner Group is still recruiting fighters across Russia, days after staging a mutiny that led Vladimir Putin to raise fears of civil war.\n\nUsing a Russian phone number, we called more than a dozen recruitment centres saying, if asked, that we were inquiring on behalf of a brother.\n\nAll those who replied confirmed that it was business as usual.\n\nFrom Kaliningrad in the west to Krasnodar in the south, no-one believed the group was being disbanded.\n\nIn the Arctic city of Murmansk, a woman at the Viking sports club confirmed that she was still signing up fighters for Ukraine.\n\n\"That's where we are recruiting for, yes. If someone wants to go, they just have to call me and we'll set a day.\"\n\nWagner's long list of contact points are mostly based at fight clubs, including martial arts schools and boxing clubs.\n\nSeveral people who picked up the phone stressed that new members were signing contracts with the mercenary group itself, not the Russian defence ministry.\n\nContacts for Wagner's recruitment offices are still online and insisting it is business as usual\n\n\"It's absolutely nothing to do with the defence ministry,\" a man at the Sparta sports club in Volgograd was adamant. \"Nothing has stopped, we're still recruiting.\"\n\nThe demand for the mercenaries to transfer to the defence ministry, thus bringing the Wagner Group and its boss Yevgeny Prigozhin to heel, was at the root of the fierce feud that exploded into last weekend's armed uprising.\n\nIt was the biggest challenge to President Putin's authority in his more than 20-year rule, despite the Kremlin's scrambling ever since to redefine his response as strong and decisive.\n\nAnd yet the criminal case against the mutineers has been dropped, in a country where multiple opposition activists are serving long prison sentences just for speaking out against Russia's war on Ukraine.\n\nEven Wagner's leader has been allowed to go free, apparently moving to Belarus - although Prigozhin's private jet was tracked flying back to Russia on Tuesday night.\n\nAnd his army, which marched on Moscow and shot helicopters and a plane out of the sky, has still not been disbanded.\n\n\"We are working. If something had changed, they'd have told us. But there's nothing,\" a female recruiter in Krasnodar, southern Russia, was clear.\n\nA Wagner fighter's salary remains a generous 240,000 roubles (\u00a32,175) a month; the contracts are for six months.\n\nOn Thursday, the chair of the defence committee in Russia's parliament said that Prigozhin had been warned earlier that the deadline for Wagner to be subsumed by the defence ministry was non-negotiable.\n\n\"The defence ministry said all groups\u2026must sign contracts, and they all began doing that. Everyone except Mr Prigozhin,\" Andrei Kartapolov commented, referring to his mutiny as an act of treason.\n\n\"He was informed that Wagner would not participate in the Special Military Operation,\" he used Russia's euphemism for its war on Ukraine. \"It also would get no", "was frozen and stored in New York.

It is often, but not always, done in exchange for money.\n\nThe baby, named Ana Sandra, will be registered at the Spanish consulate before they fly to Madrid, Ana Obreg\u00f3n explains, and she refuses to rule out providing her granddaughter with a brother or sister.\n\nWhile \u00a1Hola! magazine's front page carried a picture of the TV actress and the new baby, another Spanish magazine, Lecturas, featured the surrogate mother who bore Ana Sandra.\n\nEthically, adoption by a grandmother could potentially become a problem under Spain's civil code because under Article 175 you are not entitled to adopt \"a descendant\", however Ana Obreg\u00f3n makes clear that legally she is the baby's mother, even if she is biologically her grandmother.\n\nWhile a dead man's semen is regularly used for insemination in assisted reproduction in Spain, it is allowed only within 12 months of a man's death and would involve a widow.\n\nSocial philosophy commentator Gonzalo Velasco said there was nothing illegal about it as far as he knew, but he believed there was an ethical issue.\n\n\"Ana Obreg\u00f3n has taken it upon herself to interpret her dead son's wishes and that is going too far,\" he told radio station Cadena SER. \"No child is ever the property of his parents and neither is a dead child.

A big rally has been banned in Leipzig.\n\nOther Germans were angered by the decision to release Lina E - criminal defendants' second names are not made public - after two and a half years in custody - believing this sends a signal to the left that violence against the extreme right is acceptable.\n\nThe judge, Hans Schl\u00fcter-Staats, said Lina E would be allowed out pending the result of her appeal. She is said to be unwell and has had to hand in her identity card and passport.\n\nDelivering his verdict, the judge said that \"opposing right-wing extremists is a respectable motive\", but use of force was only for the state and her actions were still \"serious criminal acts\". He criticised her defence lawyers' argument that the case was politically motivated.\n\nLina E was seen as the ringleader of her far-left group which waged a brutal campaign of violence against the extreme right for several years - using hammers, iron bars and baseball bats.\n\nLeft-wing protesters took to the streets targeting police with bottles and fireworks after the verdict\n\nIn one attack in 2019, the gang attacked a well-known neo-Nazi pub called the Bull's Eye in the town of Eisenach, beating its owner Leon R.

Watch: The latest on the Titanic sub... in 70 seconds\n\nThe huge search for a missing submersible vessel near the wreck of the Titanic has entered a critical stage, as fears mount over the oxygen levels that may be on board.\n\nIf the sub is still functional and intact, it may only have low levels of oxygen left based on earlier estimates.\n\nIt went missing in a remote area of the North Atlantic on Sunday with a four-day oxygen supply for its crew of five.\n\nAnd on Thursday many questions remained over how it could be recovered.\n\nThe minivan-sized submersible, which was owned and operated by the private company OceanGate Expeditions, is yet to be located. If it is found, it will need to be reached by complex rescue equipment and then brought to the surface in an operation that would likely take hours.\n\nThat would need to happen before the oxygen supply runs out and without damaging its structure or endangering those on board.\n\nThe condition of the vessel and its crew of five is unknown, but the US Coast Guard said the operation remains a rescue mission. \"This is a search-and-rescue mission, 100%,\" Captain Jamie Frederick told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nThere appeared to be a glimmer of hope after officials said undersea noises had been detected by Canadian search planes on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nBut it is still unclear what these were, and officials said they may not have come from the submersible. Remote-controlled underwater search vehicles (ROVs) were deployed to the area where the sounds were detected but are yet to find anything.\n\nOne of the ROVs, deployed from the Canadian vessel Horizon Arctic, reached the ocean floor early Thursday morning. Several more were expected to arrive at the site later in the day, along with more multi-national support.\n\nA French research ship, the Atalante, also arrived in the area on Thursday morning and deployed its own ROV, the US Coast Guard said. That robot is capable of researching depths below the Titanic wreck, which lies about 12,500 ft (3,810m) below the surface, and has experience of surveying the Titanic.\n\nThe overall area of sea being scoured is about 26,000 sq km (10,000 sq miles), twice the size of the US state of Connecticut. The area is prone to stormy conditions and poor visibility which makes search operations more challenging, experts say.\n\nOn board the 21-foot vessel is British businessman Hamish Harding, British-Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman, former French navy diver Paul-Henry Nargeolet and the CEO of OceanGate - which operates the submersible - Stockton Rush.\n\n\"One of the factors that makes it hard to predict how much oxygen is left is that we do not know the rate of the consumption of oxygen per occupant on the sub,\" Rear Admiral John Mauger from the US Coast Guard told the BBC.\n\nDr Ken LeDez, a hyperbaric medicine expert at Memorial University in St John's, Newfoundland, told the BBC it was possible the crew could survive even as oxygen supplies dwindle, depending on the crew's fitness and the conditions in the submersible.\n\nWhile it is impossible to know the exact conditions inside, Dr LeDez said the crew will likely be facing increasing levels of carbon dioxide and could also be dealing with cold temperatures, along with the declining levels of oxygen.\n\nA combination of these factors could lead to hypothermia and a loss of consciousness, he said. But these conditions aren't necessarily deadly and their metabolisms slowing down because of the cold could help them survive longer, he added.\n\n\"They're very smart... very accomplished people in there,\" he said. \"If anybody can survive\" in it, \"it's these individuals.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nWizz Air operates short-haul flights from eight UK airports including Birmingham, Edinburgh, Gatwick and Luton\n\nWizz Air was the worst major airline for flight delays from UK airports for the second year in a row, new figures show.\n\nThe Hungarian carrier's UK departures were an average of 46 minutes and six seconds behind schedule in 2022.\n\nIt is based on analysis of Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) data by the PA news agency.\n\nThat was more than three times longer than the previous year, when it was also ranked last for punctuality.\n\nThe analysis took into account all scheduled and chartered departures from UK airports by airlines with more than 2,500 flights.\n\nThe average delay for all these flights was 23 minutes.\n\nAfter Wizz Air, Tui ranked second with an average delay of 40 minutes and 18 seconds, and Qatar Airways third with 31 minutes and 48 seconds.\n\nNorwegian Air Shuttle recorded the best performance with an average delay of just 13 minutes and 42 seconds.\n\nMay and June were the worst months for punctuality as the aviation sector failed to recruit and train enough staff to cope with a surge in demand for holidays following the ending of the UK's Covid-19 travel rules.\n\nRory Boland, editor of magazine Which? Travel, said: \"These figures are worrying, but will be no surprise to passengers who've had to endure shoddy treatment from airlines for years.\"\n\nThe CAA has civil powers to take enforcement action against airlines, but court cases typically take several years to be concluded.\n\nGovernment proposals to give the regulator more powers were consulted on in early 2022, but no changes have been made.\n\nCAA consumer director Paul Smith claimed \"too many passengers faced disappointing levels of delays\" last year.\n\n\"The CAA has regularly asked for stronger consumer enforcement powers, including the ability to impose fines on airlines,\" he said.\n\n\"When things do go wrong, we expect airlines to proactively provide passengers with information about their rights when flights are disrupted, as well as offer timely support and assistance.\n\n\"We've already raised concerns about Wizz Air and are working closely with the airline to improve outcomes for consumers.\"\n\nIn February the airline ended its service in and out of Wales, citing running costs and the current", "who seems to be more convincing, the Mirror Group or Prince Harry and other claimants - and it's quite possible that the result won't be known until the autumn.\n\nIf he FaceTimes his family in California, as he said yesterday, it might be more relaxed this evening.\n\nBut given the number of other legal claims involving Prince Harry, this could be the first of a number of courtroom appearances. From the royal court to the law court.\n\nPolice officers in England will no longer respond to concerns about mental health if there is no risk to life or crime being committed, under new plans.\n\nThe government says the policy could save a million hours of police time every year.\n\nSenior officers say forces have \"lost their way\" by dealing with less serious mental health problems.\n\nBut mental health charities say they are \"deeply worried\" at what could be a \"dangerous\" change.\n\nAt the moment, some police forces in England and Wales attend 80% of so-called health and social care incidents.\n\nIt is expected this will be reduced to between 20 and 30% within the next two years, under the plans.\n\nThe government says it is providing an extra \u00a31bn a year, including \u00a3150m for facilities to replace police officers, including:\n\nAnd 999-call handlers are being trained to assess a request for officers to attend and decide whether:\n\nBut Mind chief executive Dr Sarah Hughes said mental health services were \"not resourced to step up overnight\".\n\nDr Hughes told BBC Breakfast that the system wasn't \"ready\" and that mental health services were \"not fully equipped\" to help the number of people in need.\n\n\"We're nowhere near a situation where services are in a strong enough place to pick up the slack,\" she added.\n\nThe additional funding had been announced in 2021, the charity said, so there was no new money to pay for additional referrals from the police, at a time of growing demand for mental health services.\n\nHowever, the government's policing minister Chris Philp told the BBC's Today programme he was \"confident it will be safe\".\n\n\"We do need additional mental health capacity,\" he acknowledged, adding that the government was investing more in mental health provisions.\n\nMr Philp said the plans won't be rolled out with a \"big bang\" on day one, but instead will be decided in \"discussion with police and the local health partners\".\n\nHaving tested the policy during the past three years, Humberside Police said it had saved an average of 1,441 hours of police time a month.\n\nThree other forces, Hampshire, Lancashire and South Yorkshire, are also starting to introduce the policy, to be implemented across England within three years.\n\nIn Sheffield, 999-response officer PC April Clark was recently called to a man trying to throw himself from a first-floor window.\n\n\"It is quite literally in my hands,\" she said.\n\n\"You can't let them go. You can't let anything happen to them. You've got to do what you can for them and their family until the right help comes along.\"\n\nShe has also dealt with a young mother's suicide.\n\nThese are both cases in which officers would still attend.\n\nBut PC Clark said she also regularly handled calls from NHS staff and members of the public \"going home for the weekend in their nine-to-five jobs\", asking the police for a ''welfare check\" on someone with mental health issues.\n\nOfficers can end up sitting with patients for 12 hours and more in hospitals, because no-one else is available and NHS staff are concerned about the risk to the patient, staff or public.\n\nAn early assessment of the impact of the changes in Humberside Police concluded that police turned down requests to carry out welfare checks, or look for patients who had gone \"AWOL\". They also handed over the care of patients more quickly to the health service.\n\nThis meant more patients were seen by health service staff with appropriate training rather than police officers.\n\nDeputy Chief Constable Rachel Bacon, from the National Police Chiefs' Council said the new approach would be better for people in mental health crises who tended to \"feel criminalised\" when officers turned up to help them. Some mistakenly believed they were under arrest.\n\nCurrently, officers are sometimes required by law when someone is detained under the Mental Health Act, allowing them to be taken to a place of safety, possibly against their will.\n\nBut the National Police Chiefs' Council plans to ask the government to change this.\n\nHow do you think urgent mental health issues should be dealt with?

I guarantee it.\"\n\nWhen asked if this included central government in London, he said: \"I'm quite sure the UK government wants to help. But we will work with all partners to deliver the Casement Park stadium.\"\n\nAsked how much money the UK government was willing to contribute, he said: \"I don't actually know how much the whole thing is going to cost. We've seen different estimates. But let's win the bid first.\n\n\"Once we win the bid, we'll sit down round a table and the money will get sorted out.\"\n\nA decision on who will host the 2028 Euro finals is expected to be made by Uefa's executive committee in September.\n\nDublin's Aviva Stadium was also included in the final list of 10 grounds in the UK/Ireland application.\n\nGlasgow's Hampden Park, Cardiff's Principality Stadium and Wembley in London are on the list too.\n\nThe funding of the Casement Park stadium is complicated by the fact that the Northern Ireland Executive at Stormont is currently not functioning.\n\nThe GAA agreed to pay \u00a315m towards the initial cost of the stadium, saying it was their maximum contribution.\n\nIn spite of the ongoing financial and political difficulties, Mr Heaton-Harris remains upbeat about the chances of the west Belfast redevelopment going ahead.\n\nMr Heaton-Harris said: \"I've seen from London 2012 (Olympics) what having a big stadium built in a locality can do to change the environment and the positive legacy you get from that, and I think that would be brilliant for Northern Ireland.\n\n\"It is a vital part of the bid to have games across the four nations of the United Kingdom, and in Ireland as well. And it is a really, really strong bid. We're bidding against strong opponents in Turkey, and everybody wants it to work.\"\n\nChris Heaton-Harris said having a big stadium can bring positivity to Northern Ireland\n\nThe secretary of state was speaking in south Antrim as he announced a total of \u00a3600,000 of funding for 28 local sports facilities in Northern Ireland, in conjunction with the Irish Football Association (IFA).\n\nAmong the clubs to benefit are Crewe United in south Antrim, Enniskillen Rangers FC,", "booing - I don't see how you come back from that. Chelsea's owners thought 'let's do it now.'\n\n\"Some managers are better suited to managing the underdogs who have to punch above their weight and I think Potter could be that.\"\n\nPotter's dismissal is Chelsea's 17th managerial change this century and, of the full-time incumbents of the role, his reign was by far the shortest.\n\nOnly Luis Felipe Scolari (36), Andre-Villas Boas (40) and Roberto Di Matteo (42) failed to reach the 50-game mark and even interim manager Rafael Benitez (48) lasted longer than Potter.\n\nChelsea paid Brighton in excess of \u00a321m in compensation for Potter to bring him to Stamford Bridge. Boehly said at the time that he fitted \"our vision\" and had \"skills and capabilities that extend beyond the pitch which will make Chelsea a more successful club\".\n\nThat indicated Chelsea were looking to pursue a long-term approach in the dugout after sacking Tuchel.\n\nAfter a promising start of nine games unbeaten, including five successive victories and comfortable qualification for the knockout stages of the Champions League, things began to unravel just before the break for the World Cup.\n\nThe slide began with a 4-1 humbling at his former club Brighton, followed by defeats against Arsenal and Newcastle and a Carabao Cup exit at Manchester City.\n\nThey returned from the World Cup break with a 2-0 victory over Bournemouth, but won just three of their next 13 league matches.\n\nPotter's side were also thumped 4-0 at Manchester City in the FA Cup third round in January, but overturned a first-leg deficit against Borussia Dortmund last month to reach the Champions League quarter-finals.\n\nIn February, Potter says his mental health suffered after he and his family received anonymous abuse following the club's poor run of form.\n\nFirst sacking for manager with previous record of success\n\nUntil his brief reign at Chelsea, Potter had enjoyed managerial success at each of the three clubs he had served.\n\nHe led Swedish side Ostersunds from the fourth tier into the top flight with three promotions in five seasons and won the 2017 Swedish Cup, earning a spot in the Europa League and reaching the knockout stages of that competition.\n\nIn his one subsequent season with Swansea City in 2018-19, they finished 10th in the Championship following relegation from the top flight and reached the FA Cup quarter-finals where they led Manchester City 2-0 before losing 3-2.\n\nPotter was then recruited by Brighton and, after three seasons of steady progress, led them to their highest-ever Premier League finish of ninth last term as well as collecting plenty of praise for their style of play.\n\nThey sat fourth in this season's table when he left for Chelsea in September.\n\nSince his departure, Brighton have continued to thrive under new manager Roberto de Zerbi and are pushing for a European place.\n\u2022 None Our coverage of Chelsea is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment\n\u2022 None Everything Chelsea - go straight to all the best content\n\nNoel Clarke has appeared in films including Kidulthood and TV Shows like Doctor Who\n\nNoel Clarke is seeking approximately \u00a310m damages from the Guardian over articles about his alleged behaviour towards several women, according to court documents seen by BBC News.\n\nIn the eight articles, 20 women who worked with Mr Clarke over a 15-year period made misconduct allegations.\n\nThe actor and producer, who denies the allegations, says the articles have had a \"catastrophic\" effect on his career.\n\nShould he win his case, a judge will decide what damages he is entitled to.\n\nAccording to documents lodged at London's High Court as part of a defamation claim against the Guardian, as well as claiming for general damages which cover harm to reputation, Mr Clarke is seeking special damages which cover specific financial losses.\n\nMr Clarke's claim says \"the impact on him financially has been devastating\".\n\nThe claim adds that as well as \"every existing or upcoming contract\" being cancelled, Mr Clarke has \"not had one single work contract\" since the first Guardian article about him was published in April 2021.\n\nChannel 5 TV show Highwater (a greenlit show which he says would probably have begun shooting in winter 2021)\n\nBBC TV show Crongton (a greenlit show which he says was likely to be shot around late summer 2022)\n\nStudioCanal movie Something in the Water\n\nLegal fees on dealing with Guardian allegations when first published, involving two law firms\n\nThe total approximate figure, excluding VAT, comes to\n\nMr Clarke is also claiming aggravated damages, for what his lawyers describe as the \"relentless, targeted, vicious and persistent nature of the wholly unjustified defamatory campaign\" launched against him by the Guardian.\n\nThe next significant stage due in the case is a hearing at the High Court to determine the exact meaning of the articles, whether they are defamatory and whether they are statements of fact or opinion.\n\nThis was scheduled to take place this week on Thursday 20 July.

She will be back in this studio in two weeks, on Monday 5 June.\"\n\nHowever, on Thursday's programme, Willoughby said \"see you Monday\" to viewers - suggesting her absence this week was not planned and her half-term holiday has been brought forward.\n\nSchofield and Willoughby picked up the best daytime prize at the National Television Awards in 2019\n\nFormer This Morning presenter Eamonn Holmes, who was dropped in 2021, was less complimentary about Schofield on his GB News breakfast show on Monday.\n\nDuring the newspaper review, when Holmes' co-host Isabel Webster said Schofield was \"stepping down\", Holmes replied: \"Oh please just stop this. He was sacked. All this nonsense of 'I've decided to step down'. I'm sure you did - 'Here's your P45, now step down'.\"\n\nHe went on to quote Willoughby's statement about Schofield's departure, commenting: \"And she says, 'Oh, the couch will not be the same without him being there'. Well she wanted him not there. So what is she moaning about? They deserve each other, I suppose.\"\n\nHolmes described her statement as \"stabbing in the back\" and said his phone was \"full of people who are glad to see the back of the two of them\".\n\nMeanwhile Piers Morgan, who left ITV's Good Morning Britain in 2021 following an on-air clash with the show's weather presenter, said he had \"sympathy\" with Schofield, who he believes was entitled to a \"better send-off\".\n\n\"Anyone who thinks that daytime telly is full of smiley, nicey, happy clappy people, I think they are beginning to realise it is infested by a pack of savages,\" Morgan told Times Radio.\n\nFormer ITV host Piers Morgan said he felt Schofield was entitled to a better send-off from This Morning\n\n\"There is nothing more ruthless than the way that talent, as we [presenters] so laughably get called in television, get treated when the plug gets pulled.\n\n\"So I have some sympathy with Phillip Schofield, who actually I do think after 20-odd years on This Morning, winning awards every year, doing great...

The London-born singer has sold more than 100 million albums, and earlier this year she announced that her lavish Las Vegas residency would be extended. Reportedly, this pays \u00a3500,000 per show.\n\nHarry Styles had the biggest-selling UK album last year with \"Harry's House\", and is currently on tour in the UK. The 29-year-old's wealth is pegged at \u00a3150m.\n\nSitting on top of the main Rich List is Gopi Hinduja and family, who own a vast conglomerate of businesses across the world and whose combined wealth is \u00a335bn, up from \u00a328.4bn last year.\n\nSir Jim Ratcliffe makes a return to the top 10 of Britain's richest people after two years down the ranks.\n\nNow worth \u00a329.6bn, Sir Jim is perhaps best known at the moment for his battle to buy Manchester United, his football team since boyhood. He made his fortune through Ineos, a chemicals and raw materials business.\n\nWhile the Rich List is made up of the uber-wealthy, this is the first year that the number of billionaires has fallen since the global financial crisis in 2008 when the banking industry nearly collapsed.\n\nThere are now 171 billionaires listed, down by six from the previous year. The economic impact of Covid, high inflation and rising interest rates - which make it more expensive to borrow money - have weighed on the fortunes of the rich.\n\nSir Richard Branson, who recently told the BBC he feared losing everything during the pandemic, has seen his wealth almost halve to \u00a32.4bn. The man behind the airline Virgin Atlantic said he lost \u00a31.5bn as Covid lockdowns grounded flights and kept his hotels and health clubs shuttered.\n\nMr Sunak and his wife Ms Murthy have also seen their fortunes fall by \u00a3200m, from the \u00a3730m they were worth last year to \u00a3529m.\n\nUK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his wife Akshata Murthy are worth \u00a3529m\n\nThe majority of their wealth comes from Ms Murthy who owns a sizable stake in her father's IT business Infosys.\n\nThe newly-crowned King Charles III has the relatively low ranking of 263 on the Rich List with a fortune of \u00a3600m. However, he is wealthier than his late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, who was worth \u00a3320m, according to last year's list.\n\nConsiderably richer is JK Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter books. She is worth \u00a3875m, a rise of \u00a325m from the previous year. She could become wealthier still - the writer is reportedly in talks with the TV network HBO about making her most famous creation into a series.\n\nMeanwhile, two of the stars of the Harry Potter films are on the list of the richest under 35s. Daniel Radcliffe, 33, is worth \u00a392m while Emma Watson, also 33, has an estimated wealth of \u00a360m.\n\nClaimants stand outside the High Court ahead of a hearing in the Primodos legal action in May\n\nClaims for damages by more than 170 people who say they were affected by hormone-based pregnancy test drugs have been thrown out by a High Court judge.\n\nThe drugs, including Primodos, were given to women to test if they were pregnant from the 1950s to 1970s and alleged to have caused birth defects.\n\nBut the judge ruled there was no new evidence linking the tests with foetal harm", "that is not likely to be ready for another three years and they will first have to spend an estimated \u00a310m renovating their comparatively dilapidated back-streets Kenilworth Road home.\n\nThey will still have the smallest ground capacity in the top flight next season, but it is all still a far cry from when they dropped out of the Football League in 2009, before taking five seasons to get back in 2014, eventually under John Still.\n\nThey took the next two steps under Jones, with back-to-back promotions in 2018 and 2019 before he moved on to Stoke.\n\nHaving returned for a second spell to establish the Hatters as Championship promotion contenders, Jones then moved on again.\n\nBut, since Edwards took over, he has presided over 18 wins and just six defeats from his 35 matches in charge.\n\nDefeat for Coventry for the first time in a Wembley final was particularly cruel.\n\nTheir fans have had a tortuous time since being relegated from the Premier League in 2001.\n\nIn 2005 they were forced to leave their Highfield Road home, then two years later they were saved from potential extinction by just minutes following Sisu's late takeover.\n\nIn 2013 they sought refuge from their ongoing rent row with the local council by moving to Northampton.\n\nThey moved back to their home at the Ricoh Arena the following year, with fellow tenants Wasps now their new landlords.\n\nBut in 2019 they had to move again, with two seasons spent at Birmingham City's St Andrew's.\n\nThey then found themselves bottom of the league, without a pitch, at the start of this season, when they had to postpone four home games, playing six of their first seven away.\n\nThey were then even briefly without a ground too, when they were served with the threat of an eviction by the stadium's new owners.\n\nBut boss Mark Robins and his assistant manager Adi Viveash, both rewarded in the past fortnight with new four-year contracts, did a brilliant job turning their season round - and the club were put even more firmly back on the rails when new owner Doug King took over in January.\n\nIn the short term, failing to go up might yet cost them the services of their much-admired star striker Gyokeres, who failed to score in the Sky Blues' final five games, and Brazilian playmaker Hamer.\n\nBut Robins and his team have crucially won back the Coventry fans - and they will start next season among the Championship promotion favourites.\n\n\"We lost Tom Lockyer, but recovered really well after that and showed a lot of emotional strength and character.\n\n\"We lost our captain and best player. All I've been thinking about since the final whistle is that. Health is more important than anything.\n\n\"The performance in the first half was excellent. They had the first 20-25 minutes of the second half and got the goal, but we started wrestling back some momentum and then obviously it was tight.\n\n\"I'm so proud to be a part of this club. The players, the staff, the board, the supporters, they deserve to enjoy this - they've been through a lot.\"\n\n\"It was very tight. First half we didn't really show up. Second half, we were much better. We got back into it, Gustavo Hamer scored and it looked like there was only going to be one winner. They were rocking.\n\n\"But the fact that Gustavo got injured and we then had to take him off swung the impetus back in their favour a bit. He landed on his ankle badly and had to come off.\n\n\"When their goal was disallowed, I thought maybe it was going to be our day, but then it was penalties.\n\n\"The first 10 were outstanding.

West Midlands Police is appealing for help to find the bike.\n\nHer mother, Tsvetelina Selezneva, said: \"My heart is bleeding, my soul is aching.\"\n\nIn a tribute posted on Facebook, Ms Selezneva added: \"God took her away too young and fragile.\n\n\"I don't have strength and I don't want to say goodbye to you, my star.\"\n\nThe 14-year-old was detained within two hours on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and remained in custody, police said.\n\nThe seven-year-old girl was found in a critical condition and later died in hospital\n\n\"This is an absolutely tragic event which has resulted in the death of an innocent child,\" said Det Sgt Paul Hughes of the West Midlands force.\n\nTwo bikes were recovered close to the Turnstone Road scene in Bloxwich, police said, but neither had been identified as the one involved.\n\n\"I know someone out there in the local community knows where the bike is,\" Det Sgt Hughes said.\n\nThe girl was hit and fatally hurt in Turnstone Road on Thursday evening\n\nCrowds of people, including children, gathered at the scene on Friday to leave flowers, toys and other tributes, many of them in a state of shock.\n\nOn Facebook, Ms Selezneva commented on the outpouring, saying: From acquaintances and strangers, everyone cries, everyone comes to leave something and express their sorrow", "for a cigarette.\n\nAbove him, colleagues in a cherry picker are hard at work, hauling a new high voltage line up to a pylon.\n\n\"Sometimes we go on trips to restore power in an area. Then they shell us and we have to go back. It's a race.\"\n\nFor all the hardship we observe during two weeks on the road in Ukraine, it's a race the engineers seem to be winning. People grumble, for sure, when the lights go out, their apartments grow cold and the water stops flowing. Hospitals have reported higher numbers of road traffic accidents as motorists move around darkened city roads.\n\nBut away from the front lines, people have adjusted to the lack of electricity much as they have to the air raid sirens and occasional explosions: with pragmatism and ingenuity.\n\nOn city streets, in the middle of a blackout, portable generators churn away on pavements and down alleyways. In Kyiv, for all the midwinter gloom, shops are open, restaurants full. Walk into any motorway service station and the same scene greets you every time: brightly lit, well-stocked shelves, muzak playing and the hand-driers in immaculate toilets blasting out hot air.\n\nYou could be forgiven for thinking you were anywhere else in Europe. And that's the way those in charge of Ukraine's energy grid would like it.\n\n\"It was our aim for many years, to integrate into the European grid,\" says Oleksandr Kharchenko, EIRC's director. \"And now it's happened.\"\n\nRussia's energy war, just like its military campaign, is having the exact opposite of its desired effect. Far from separating Ukraine from Europe, it's binding it ever closer, in a process that mirrors the country's gradual integration into the Western military alliance, Nato.\n\nUkraine officially declared its desire to join the European grid in 2017. It's typically a lengthy process - it took Turkey 11 years - but when Vladimir Putin decided to invade last year, the process accelerated dramatically. In February last year Ukraine disconnected itself from the Russian grid for the first time, to test the country's ability to manage in \"isolated mode\" during the winter months, when demand for electricity peaks.\n\nThe disconnect, the first of two, was due to take place on the 18th and last just three days. The Russians requested a delay. It eventually happened at 01:00 on 24 February.\n\n\"We disconnected four hours before the invasion started, from this very building,\" Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, CEO of Ukrenergo, told me at his Kyiv headquarters.\n\n\"When the invasion started, it became obvious we would not reconnect.\"\n\nWas the invasion timed to coincide with Ukraine's moment of maximum isolation?\n\n\"I absolutely believe the war started on the 24th just because of this,\" Kharchenko says.\n\nInfrastructure was targeted in the early days, but not enough to plunge the country into chaos.\n\n\"They thought we would have a national blackout,\" Kharchenko says. \"That this would cause panic, no connection, no government, no-one knows where the president is, how to connect with your siblings, your parents.\"\n\nAmid mounting speculation about Moscow's intentions in the weeks before 24 February, the company had quietly moved the grid's main control room to an undisclosed location further west. A second experimental disconnect was scheduled for June, when demand is typically low. If everything went according to plan, Ukraine would finally join the European grid in October 2023.\n\nBut with industry shutting down and millions of Ukrainians fleeing the country, electricity consumption plummeted by 40% within three days of the invasion. Ukrenergo asked its European partners if it could bring forward the second test.\n\n\"They looked at us like we were crazy,\" Kharchenko, who advises Ukrenergo, recalls.\n\nBut by 16 March, it was all done. With Russian troops still menacing the capital, Ukraine connected to the European grid, a year-and-a-half ahead of schedule. For a few months, Ukraine was even able to export its excess electricity.\n\nThat all stopped in October. Since then, the country has had to make do with half the electricity it had before 24 February.\n\n\"I think the reason is the same why they cannot win on the battlefield,\" Kudrytskyi says. \"Because we were prepared and we were resolved to win this particular battle.\"\n\nUkraine has fought many battles over the past year.\n\nIn a sprawling, hilltop cemetery on the edge of the eastern city of Dnipro, hundreds of blue and yellow Ukrainian flags flap noisily in the stiff breeze. Rows of freshly dug graves await the latest casualties from the front, 100 miles to the east. Each cross, unmarked grave and rippling flag drives home the desperate cost of this war.\n\nBut overhead, rising against a fiery sunset, pylons march away across the landscape.\n\nThe edition is a close replica of a King James Bible from 1611\n\nAn academic who was tasked with editing the Bible on which King Charles will swear his Coronation Oath has spoken about why he decided to include hundreds of misprints.\n\nProf Gordon Campbell, from Leicester, edited the book the monarch will rest his hand on when he recites the oath at Westminster Abbey on Saturday.\n\nThe original text of the King James bible dates back to 1611.\n\nProf Campbell said he had wanted his version to be close to the original.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury commissioned Oxford University Press (OUP) to produce a special hand-bound edition, decorated in gold leaf, for the Coronation.\n\nProf Campbell, emeritus professor and fellow in Renaissance studies at the University of Leicester, prepared the edition to mark its 400th anniversary in 2011 but said he was surprised it was chosen for use in historic ceremony.\n\nThe King will be given a personal copy to keep\n\nHe said: \"Over the centuries the King James Version has been quietly updated, with spelling modernised and cross-references added.\n\n\"I decided to publish an edition that was as close to the original as possible, but in roman type, which is much easier to read than the black letter gothic type of the original.\n\n\"I therefore reproduced the original pagination and a text, with all its 350 misprints, that was line by line, word by word and letter by letter the same as the 1611 Bible.\n\n\"It is as close as one could possibly get to the 1611 text.\n\n\"It has for centuries been the traditional and much-loved Bible of the Church of England and the people of England.\"\n\nThe bible used in the service will be kept by the Archbishop of Canterbury and placed in Lambeth Palace's archive.\n\nOUP will produce three identical copies, one as a personal gift to King Charles and a further two to be placed in the archives of Westminster Abbey and OUP's head office in Oxford.\n\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, or on Instagram.

Semenya has twice failed in legal battles to overturn the decision.\n\nHowever, the case at the ECHR was not against sporting bodies or DSD rules - but specifically against the government of Switzerland for not protecting Semenya's rights and dates back to a Swiss Supreme Court ruling three years ago.\n\nIn a lengthy judgement published on Tuesday, the ECHR found the Swiss government did not protect Semenya from being discriminated against when its Supreme Court refused to overturn a decision by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas), which upheld the World Athletics rules.\n\nCas has previously ruled that testosterone rules for athletes like Semenya, were discriminatory - but that the discrimination was \"necessary, reasonable and proportionate\" to protect \"the integrity of female athletics\".\n\nWhile the judgement would appear to vindicate Semenya's long-held view that she has suffered discrimination, it's uncertain if or how the court's decision will impact the current restrictions on DSD athletes.\n\nWorld Athletics has doubled down on its position in its efforts to protect fair competition in the female category, and is also keen for the Swiss courts to challenge the ECHR verdict.\n\nThere is a three-month window to lodge an appeal. In terms of competing - if that's what she wants - that leaves Semenya in a similar position to where she was before the ECHR ruling, unless she takes medication to suppress her testosterone or World Athletics is forced to change its position on DSD athletes, and it's not clear how that could happen.\n\nAs it stands, she still cannot compete in female track events.\n\nAn ECHR statement said Semenya \"had not been afforded sufficient institutional and procedural safeguards in Switzerland\" to allow her to \"have her complaints examined effectively, especially since her complaints concerned substantiated and credible claims of discrimination as a result of her increased testosterone level caused by differences of sex development.\"\n\nThe EHCR ruling suggests that the World Athletics' DSD regulations were \"a source of discrimination\" for Semenya \"by the manner in which they were exercised and by their effects\", and the regulations were \"incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights\".\n\nThe decision, made by a panel of seven people at the ECHR, was split 4-3 in favour of Semenya and may allow her to challenge the Swiss Supreme Court or Cas rulings.\n\nWorld Athletics described the ECHR chamber as \"deeply divided\" and said it will ask the Swiss government to refer the case to the ECHR Grand Chamber for a \"final and definitive decision\".\n\nWorld Athletics said: \"We remain of the view that the DSD regulations are a necessary, reasonable and proportionate means of protecting fair competition in the female category as the Court of Arbitration for Sport and Swiss Federal Tribunal both found, after a detailed and expert assessment of the evidence.\n\n\"We will liaise with the Swiss government on the next steps.

Today's judgment is testament to her resilience and courage. This important personal win for her is also a wider victory for elite athletes around the world.\n\n\"It means that sporting governance bodies around the world must finally recognise that human rights law and norms apply to the athletes they regulate.\"\n\nA statement from Athletics South Africa said the ruling \"vindicated\" its belief that the existing DSD rules were \"ill-conceived\" - and that it would seek legal advice about the consequences for Semenya's potential future participation in athletics.\n\nUnder regulations introduced in 2018, athletes with DSD were only allowed to compete in track events between 400m and the mile if they reduced their testosterone levels.\n\nHowever, in March World Athletics ruled that DSD athletes must now have hormone-suppressing treatment for six months before being eligible to compete in all events.\n\nSemenya ran in the 5,000m at last year's World Championships in Oregon but failed to qualify for the final.\n\nShe has argued that taking testosterone-reducing medication could endanger her health and that the ruling denied her and other athletes with DSD the right to rely on their natural abilities.\n\nBecause of the ruling, she could not defend her 800m title at the Tokyo Olympics, which took place a year later than planned in 2021.\n\nSemenya, who has always been legally identified as female, has said she should be able to compete in women's events even if her testosterone levels are higher than her competitors.\n\nIn 2019 she told BBC Sport she had been \"crucified\" but will \"never stop fighting\" against the regulations brought in by World Athletics, then known as the IAAF.\n\nYsbyty Gwynedd in Bangor is one of the hospitals administered by the health board\n\nA troubled health board has failed to recruit a new chief executive, despite \"an intensive search\" and offering a salary of \u00a3225,000.\n\nBetsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, covering north Wales, has had four leaders in the past four years.\n\nThe Welsh government put it back into special measures in February over patient safety concerns.\n\nBut management said a search for a new chief executive has so far proved unsuccessful.\n\nConcerns were raised in February 2023 about the way the Betsi Cadwaladr health board was being run.\n\nA report by Audit Wales said that evidence \"points to dysfunctionality and factions\" within the senior executive team, and \"the whole team is not united\" around the then interim chief executive.\n\nIt highlighted \"clear and", "said it was liaising with the Driver and Vehicle Agency (DVA) Northern Ireland and the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).\n\nDonald Trump told the meeting of Republicans he was the only candidate who can win the 2024 presidential election\n\nRepublican presidential hopefuls have shared a stage for the first time in the 2024 White House race at an Iowa campaign event.\n\nAll 13 candidates were given 10 minutes to speak during the event.\n\nPolls show Mr Trump holds a lead over his rivals even as his legal woes mount.\n\nHe told attendees that he was the only candidate who can win next year's election and suggested this was the only reason he faces a raft of criminal and civil charges.\n\nMr Trump has already insisted he will still run for the White House, even if he is convicted.\n\nThere were more than 1,200 people in the huge ballroom - all of whom have an outsize influence on who will be the Republican nominee.\n\nMany said they have a genuinely open mind about who they will vote for, but there was no shortage of Trump stickers among the crowd.\n\nThere was no fun to be had watching the different candidates interacting with each other.

They separated in 2020 after he came out as gay.\n\nSchofield said he was \"so, very, very sorry\" for being unfaithful to his wife, and for lying to his colleagues, agents, employers, friends, the media, the public and his family about the relationship.\n\nHe continued: \"Contrary to speculation, whilst I met the man when he was a teenager and was asked to help him to get into television, it was only after he started to work on the show that it became more than just a friendship.\"\n\nHe also said he would \"reflect on my very bad judgement in both participating in the relationship and then lying about it\".\n\nIt followed rumours circulating on social media over several months about Schofield's personal relationships.\n\nSchofield was married to Stephanie Lowe at the time of the affair\n\nThe 61-year-old's exit from ITV means he will no longer present the British Soap Awards next month.\n\nHe will also not front a new prime-time series which the network originally said last week they were developing with him.\n\nDermot O'Leary, who has been covering for Schofield on This Morning since his exit, declined to discuss the matter on Saturday.\n\n\"I don't think it's appropriate for me to comment, especially without any knowledge,\" he told reporters outside BBC Radio 2, where he presents a weekend show.\n\nSchofield left his role at This Morning last week following reports", "2023 Women's World Cup by beating Haiti in Group D, despite playing for more than an hour with only 10 players.\n\nThe win for China means England, who beat Denmark 1-0 earlier on Friday, have not qualified for the last 16 yet.\n\nMidfielder Zhang Rui was sent off after 29 minutes for a dangerous knee-high challenge on Haiti's Sherly Jeudy.\n\nBut Wang Shuang scored the only goal, converting a 74th-minute penalty after Ruthny Mathurin fouled Zhang Linyan.\n\nEngland would have advanced to the knockout stages with a match to spare if China had drawn or lost to a Haiti side ranked 53rd in the world.\n\nThe last matches in the group take place on Tuesday, with leaders England, on six points, playing against China, while Denmark face Haiti at the same time.\n\nChina and Denmark both have three points, while Haiti, playing at their first World Cup, have zero points but can still qualify if they beat Denmark and China lose to the Lionesses.\n\u2022 None Quiz: What do you know about past 24 hours at World Cup?\n\nThis was a missed opportunity for Haiti to capitalise on their player advantage and secure what would have been the country's first World Cup point at their debut finals.\n\nMelchie Dumornay's shot was tipped over by Zhu Yu as they pushed for a goal, and that proved to be the Caribbean nation's only shot on target in the 90 minutes, but there was almost a dramatic twist.\n\nIn the second minute of additional time at the end of the second half, referee Marta Huerta de Aza awarded Haiti a penalty following what looked like a clear foul by Wu Chengshu on Roseline Eloissaint.\n\nBut, following a check from the video assistant referee, Huerta De Aza reviewed that decision on a pitchside monitor and changed her mind.\n\nHaiti's frustrations were evident and they had another shout for a penalty when Dumornay was blocked off by Li Mengwen, only for the referee to again not give the decision Haiti's way.\n\nIn the 13th minute of added time, Haiti coach Nicolas Delepine was booked for disputing the decisions against his team.\n\nChina, World Cup runners-up in 1999, had lost 1-0 to Denmark in their opening match but will now be hoping to beat England on 1 August.\n\nIf China and Denmark both win, they along with England will each have six points, with goal difference deciding which two teams advance to the knockout stage.\n\u2022 None Delay over.

But I've never cheated and I never will. That's just not something I would do.\"\n\u2022 None June fight for Eubank-Benn 'definitely not signed'\n\nKhan says he has \"no idea\" how the banned substance ended up in his system.\n\n\"I have to take some sort of responsibility. End of the day it's been found in my system. I can honestly say this is something I would never ever do [cheating].\n\n\"It was such a tiny amount, it was no benefit at all. I should have maybe taken more precautions.\n\n\"I don't want to remembered for something like this,\" he said. \"That'll hurt me.\"\n\nThe UK Anti-Doping (Ukad) website states ostarine is a drug designed to have similar effects to testosterone.\n\nKhan tested positive for the drug in a Ukad test taken on 19 February 2022, the night he lost to Brook.\n\nUkad says it informed Khan, the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC) and the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) on 6 April 2022 of a potential four-year ban. Brook and event promoters Boxxer were not told.\n\nKhan accepted two doping violations but insisted he was innocent of \"intentional doping\", which led to the case being referred to the National Anti-Doping Panel.\n\nThe case was not heard by an independent tribunal until 24 January 2023, with a written decision handed down on 21 February.\n\nIn the meantime, Khan announced his retirement from boxing on 13 May 2022, just three months after his loss to Brook and less than a month after he was told of his positive test.\n\nUkad rejected Khan's defence that the ostarine was transmitted by a tainted supplement or human contact, but did decide the dose was too small to be intentional or give any performance advantage.\n\n\"This case serves as a reminder that Ukad will diligently pursue anti-doping rule violations in order to protect clean sport,\" Ukad chief executive Jane Rumble said.\n\nBoxxer, which promoted the Khan-Brook event, said it was \"disappointed\" to learn about Khan's ban via social media on Tuesday, adding it is \"vehemently against any use of any illegal or performance-enhancing substances taken by athletes\".\n\nPromoter Ben Shalom says Boxxer was not informed of the positive drugs test and that the BBBoC was only told on Monday, which Ukad has denied.\n\n\"Ukad has an obligation to inform parties of any adverse analytical findings in accordance with the UK anti-doping rules,\" a Ukad spokesperson said. \"In this case, this means Ukad was required to and did notify Mr Khan, the BBBoC and Wada.\n\n\"It is a matter for Mr Khan thereafter as to whether he wished to divulge details of his finding to any athlete support personnel he was working with.\"\n\nThe ban from all sport runs from 6 April 2022 until 5 April 2024.\n\n'Athletes are ultimately responsible for what they ingest'\n\nLast October, British sprinter CJ Ujah was banned for 22 months after he tested positive for two banned substances, including ostarine, at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nLike Khan, Ujah denied intentionally doping but received a lengthy ban due to strict liability.\n\n\"Strict liability means athletes are ultimately responsible for what they ingest and for the presence of any prohibited substances in a sample,\" Rumble explained.\n\nFellow Briton Conor Benn failed two voluntary drug tests for female fertility drug clomifene before his cancelled bout with Chris Eubank Jr in October.\n\nBenn was allowed back into the World Boxing Council rankings after it ruled his failed drug test was not intentional and could have been caused by a \"highly elevated consumption\" of eggs.\n\u2022 None Eubank-Benn fight 'definitely not' close to being rescheduled for June\n\nHowever, he remains under investigation by Ukad and the BBBofC, and is unable to fight in the United Kingdom as he does not currently have a boxing licence.\n\n", "comes after a ten-year campaign by human rights group, Reprieve.\n\nDistinctive footwear he was allegedly wearing had been presented as crucial evidence at his 2013 trial and used to link him to the scene.\n\nBut in February 2023, at an appeal supported by Reprieve, Kenya's director of public prosecutions decided his conviction had been based on hearsay evidence about him wearing the shoes, and presented to the court without disclosure of where the information had come from.\n\nMr Kololo was then freed from Mombasa's Shimo La Tewa maximum security prison where he had been held for 11 years, pending today's judgment, which formally quashed his conviction.\n\nIn 2022 the BBC also revealed that a senior Metropolitan police officer who assisted the Kenyan investigation \"omitted key forensic evidence\" in Mr Kololo's trial.\n\nThe UK's Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), which had been investigating Det Ch Insp Neil Hibberd's role in the case since June 2018, had concluded that \"had the officer still been serving, he would have had a case to answer for gross misconduct\". The IOPC had not made public its findings.\n\nNeil Hibberd, who retired in 2017, \"absolutely disagrees with the [IOPC] findings\", his lawyer told the BBC at the time.\n\nHowever, speaking following Mr Kololo's exoneration, Mrs Tebbutt said she was \"very concerned that the British police have been deeply implicated in this travesty of justice.\"\n\nAt his trial, Mr Kololo did not have a lawyer until after the prosecution had set out its case and, despite speaking no English, had to cross-examine prosecution witnesses, including Neil Hibberd. He was later represented by pro bono lawyer, Alfred Olaba, who said the pleasure of seeing Mr Kololo reunited with his family was mixed with sadness.\n\n\"It is hard to talk of justice when an innocent young man has lost 11 years of his life to a rigged investigation and unfair trial,\" Mr Olaba said. \"But today, Kenyan courts finally began to right this terrible wrong.\"\n\nMaya Foa, director of Reprieve, said it was \"a tragedy that it took so long to reach this point\", adding: \"Ali Kololo's trial was one of the most unfair imaginable.\n\n\"The imbalance of power in the courtroom was staggering, between the senior Metropolitan Police detective testifying for the prosecution and the illiterate defendant, being tried in a language he did not understand, without the aid of a lawyer for most of the trial.\"\n\nThreads will add an alternative home feed of posts as part of a series of updates to the new social media app after users complained.\n\nInstagram boss Adam Mosseri said a feed for Threads showing posts in chronological order is currently being worked on.\n\nUsers want to see posts from accounts they follow rather than chosen by Threads' algorithm.\n\nMr Mosseri said the new feed was \"on the list\" of changes to Threads.\n\nMeta, which owns Threads, Instagram and Facebook, launched the social media app last week and more than 100 million users have signed up to use it.\n\nMr Mosseri said Mark Zuckerberg, Meta's chief executive, had given an alternative feed a \"thumbs up\", after a number of users expressed frustration at not being offered a feed of posts from people they followed, in the order in which they were posted.\n\nOther features \"on the list\", according Mr Mosseri, include:\n\nWhile it is possible to view Threads on the web, via Threads.net, there is no desktop interface - posts can be made only via the app - and that too was something the company was \"working on\", according to Mr Mosseri.\n\nThere is also no search function. When it announced the app's launch, the company said it would add a \"more robust search function\" along with improvements to the selection of recommended posts.\n\nMeanwhile the only way currently to fully delete a Threads profile is to delete the associated Instagram account, which many users would be reluctant to - another issue the company is looking to fix.\n\nWhen Threads was launched, Meta announced it planned to allow it to communicate with other social-media platforms, such as Mastodon, using something known as the fediverse.\n\nBut this suggestion while welcomed by some, has met opposition.\n\nThe idea of the fediverse is it is like email. Someone on Gmail can exchange emails with someone using Hotmail, for example, and the fediverse could be described as that idea applied to social media.\n\nAt some point in the future Meta wants users to be able to use their Threads account to interact with other social-media platforms using ActivityPub - a protocol with the necessary programming code - such as Mastodon, WordPress or Reddit-alternative Lemmy.\n\nBut some worry Threads threatens the idea of this system altogether, because of a practice big tech companies have utilised in the past - \"embrace, extend and extinguish\", when a company with a lot of resources extends what is possible from a new technology so drastically it becomes the new standard, leaving people with no choice but to use its platform.\n\nMastodon chief executive Eugen Rochko dismissed these fears, saying Meta joining Threads was \"validation of the movement towards decentralised social media\" and \"a clear victory for our cause\".\n\nBut concern among users has grown with over a hundred Mastodon communities joining what they call the \"fedipact\" - an agreement to block Meta from being able to access their community under any circumstances - so even when Threads does begin to support ActivityPub, users will not be able to access everything on the fediverse.\n\nOne other feature coming to Threads at some point may also receive mixed reviews. There is no advertising on the platform - for now.\n\nThe former BBC Newsline presenter claimed she was discriminated against on the basis of age, sex and disability\n\nThe employment tribunal case between Donna Traynor and the BBC in Northern Ireland and its director Adam Smyth has been settled.\n\nThere was no admission of liability.\n\nMs Traynor, a former BBC Newsline presenter, had claimed she was discriminated against on the basis of age, sex and disability.\n\n\"The parties are pleased that this matter has been brought to a conclusion and intend to put it behind them,\" an agreed joint statement said.\n\n\"The dispute between Donna Traynor and the BBC and Adam Smyth has ended, without any admission of liability on the part of either respondent.\n\n\"Donna Traynor acknowledges the BBC and Adam Smyth continue to refute strongly all the allegations made against them, including the claims made on the opening day of the tribunal.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

He behaved badly, the board behaved badly. He covered up and people suffered for years,\" he told the court.\n\nWhen speaking to \"journalistic friends\", he said giving evidence: \"It was like turning on a tap as soon as I spoke to them about this, it all poured out.\"\n\nThe group's legal director, Paul Vickers, was described to him as the \"villain of the piece\" because he was involved in the cover-up\", which chief executive Sly Bailey \"orchestrated\".\n\nHe also claimed he was told the publisher's legal director Marcus Partington once joked that he had left his mobile phone at home but could ask a journalist if there were any messages, because phone hacking was rife.\n\nMr Basham claimed he detailed his findings at lunch with company chairman Mr Grigson in 2012.\n\nDuring cross-examination, Andrew Green KC, on behalf of MGN, suggested Mr Basham had based his view of the company on unnamed informants.\n\n\"You were defaming a wide number of people to Mr Grigson in the hope he would pay you money to sort out the problem,\" Mr Green suggested.\n\n\"That is entirely untrue,\" Mr Basham said.\n\nPrince Harry is expected to give evidence at the trial in June.

Obviously, Hamas is not the best partner to negotiate with, but we want them back, and we want them back alive.\"\n\nNaama is pained by what Itai went through in his final months - witnessing the killing of his mother, Orit - a peace activist - on 7 October, and then languishing in captivity. And she's pained by a sense that Israel is getting used to the hostage crisis.\n\n\"I'm very worried about it,\" she tells me. \"I am worried about the nature of humankind to accept situations. I am disappointed from Israeli society. I am disappointed from the whole world that is sitting quiet and letting this happen.\"\n\nThen she leaves us to rejoin the marchers on the road to Jerusalem.\n\nDays later, relatives gather on the roadway at dusk - forming a tight circle of loss - and bringing traffic to a standstill outside Israel's defence ministry in Tel Aviv.\n\nMost carry posters with photos of sons, or daughters, or parents they have not seen or held since 7 October, when Hamas dragged them into Gaza.\n\nThen comes a sombre count (in Hebrew) \"one, two, three\" and onwards - a tally of the number of days their loved ones have been gone.\n\nThat number is now 163 (as of 17 March).\n\nEach word from the loudhailer resounds like an accusation directed at Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Signs read \"Deal refusal = Hostages' death sentence\".\n\nAmong the protesters we meet Amit Shem Tov, who wants his brother Omer back. He was taken from the music festival like Hersh Goldberg-Polin.\n\nAmit Shem Tov's brother, Omer, is among the hostages still believed to be in Gaza\n\n\"As beautiful as he is from the outside, he is more beautiful from the inside,\" Amit says, smiling at his brother's bearded face in the poster by his side, \"such a personality, too many friends, always making jokes, always laughs, always loves to dance, to live life. That's him\".\n\nThen the counting comes to an end, the few dozen protesters clear the road, and the traffic moves on - something the families of the hostages cannot do.\n\n\"For us, it's still 7 October,\" says Amit.\n\nLast updated on .From the section Women's Football\n\nEngland's defence of their European title got off to a disappointing start at Wembley Stadium as they were held to a draw by Sweden in their first Euro 2025 qualifier.\n\nAlessia Russo nodded in Lauren James' clever cross in the first half but Sweden equalised through Fridolina Rolfo later on when she crept in behind Barcelona team-mate Lucy Bronze to head in at the back post.\n\nIt was an unconvincing performance from Sarina Wiegman's side, who have been drawn in a tough qualifying group with two of the world's top six and know they need to take advantage at home.\n\nIn a repeat of the Euro 2022 semi-final, in which England thrashed Sweden 4-0, this was a much more evenly balanced encounter with Sweden carrying great threat on the counter-attack.\n\nEngland's inability to control possession led to several chances, including a huge one for Arsenal striker Stina Blackstenius in the second half when she was played in behind the hosts' defence, only to shoot wide from close range.\n\nRolfo had earlier dragged a shot wide from another counter-attacking move and the Lionesses created very little - two very late efforts from Lauren Hemp and Beth Mead were their best chances of the match.\n\nEngland's qualification route is not easy - only the top two teams from their group qualify automatically for next summer's Euros in Switzerland, with the other two sides entering the play-offs.\n\nThey also face France, ranked third in the world, and they travel to Dublin on Tuesday to take on the Republic of Ireland (19:30 BST kick-off).\n\n\"Sweden are a very tough opponent. I do think we could have done a couple of things better,\" said England boss Wiegman afterwards.\n\n\"We want to learn from these games and do better every game as other countries want to do too. It shows how close and how tight our competition is.\"\n\nThe stadium announcer at Wembley welcomed England as the \"European champions here to defend their title\" with great enthusiasm - but it was not the exhilarating match many had hoped for.\n\nAn early challenge on Russo, which led to her needing medical attention for a cut to her shin, meant there was a lengthy stoppage and England took a while to find their rhythm afterwards.\n\nRusso's infamous backheel in the semi-final two years was in the memories of many fans as they headed to Wembley on Friday and she had her moment again but this time it was not enough to lift the crowd.\n\nPaper planes were thrown around the stands and fans shone their phone camera lights in the second half as the atmosphere dipped in correlation with England's performance.\n\nSloppy in possession and lacking creativity up front, this was not the vintage England that won Euro 2022.\n\nTheir task is to qualify from the toughest group on paper and this was not an ideal start, albeit against a strong Sweden side who will fancy themselves to go all the way in Switzerland next year.\n\nThe visitors were well organised in defence and strong in their press, with manager Peter Gerhardsson saying they had a plan to \"take away Keira Walsh\" and prevent the England midfielder from having an impact.\n\n\"The number one [plan] was to take away Keira Walsh and then you can disturb her,\" he said.\n\n\"It's more that we tried to press so their faces were down and they can't make the decisions. Today for our number 10, it was all about taking away Keira Walsh, but we will not play that way at home.\"\n\nIt was a moment of quality from James which teed up Russo's goal - a lovely, dinked cross from the right which the Arsenal striker only had to nod over the line - but Bronze's lapse in concentration, allowing Rolfo to creep in behind, proved costly.\n\nAt the venue the Lionesses lifted the trophy two years ago, this was not the same feeling at full-time as many left Wembley feeling deflated at an underwhelming start to the qualifying campaign.\n\u2022 None Attempt blocked.

This helped to guide Allied ships around German U-boats in the North Atlantic.\n\nArtie Moore began his radio work from a shed in his garden, but soon moved on to bigger things\n\nArtie retired to Jamaica in 1947, but shortly after developed leukaemia and returned to Bristol for treatment, where he died a year later.\n\nIn 1985, 73 years after his amateur radio picked up the passenger liner's calls for help, it was the sonar technology he pioneered that was used in discovering its final resting place on the Atlantic seabed.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nAir raid sirens have sounded across Ukraine after Russia launched a fresh wave of drone and missile strikes.\n\nExplosions were heard overnight in the capital, Kyiv, where the mayor said five people had been injured in the \"biggest\" kamikaze drone attack so far.\n\nOne person was killed in the attack on the southern Odesa region. Ukraine's Red Cross says its warehouse was hit.\n\nIt marks the fourth attack in eight days on Kyiv and comes just 24 hours before Russia celebrates Victory Day.\n\nThe annual holiday commemorates the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany during World War Two, a conflict the Kremlin has baselessly tried to draw parallels with since launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year.\n\nAfter a lull in Russian attacks on civilian targets in recent months, which saw Kyiv go days without an attack, Moscow has intensified its air raids over the past week ahead of a widely expected Ukrainian counter-offensive.\n\nThe Ukrainian military said the latest Russian raids - which lasted for more than four hours and were launched shortly after midnight - saw Iranian-made Shahed kamikaze drones swarm across the country.\n\nKyiv's Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko said nearly 60 drones had been launched by Russia, describing it as the \"biggest\" such attack so far.\n\nHe added that all 36 drones had been destroyed over Kyiv, but five people had been injured by falling debris from downed drones.\n\nThe BBC has not been able to verify these numbers.\n\nEmergency services responded after drone wreckage fell on a runway at Zhuliany international airport - one of the city's two commercial airports - Kyiv's military administration said.\n\nAnd civilians were injured after drone debris hit a residential building in the central Shevchenkivskyi district, the administration added.\n\nElsewhere, in the Black Sea port city of Odesa, a warehouse was set ablaze after eight missiles were fired at targets by Russian bombers, Ukrainian officials said.\n\nIn a statement, Ukraine's Red Cross said its warehouse with humanitarian aid was destroyed and all aid deliveries had to be suspended.\n\nNatalia Humeniuk, a spokesperson for Ukraine's Southern Command, later said a body of a man - a security guard - was pulled from the wreckage.\n\nIn a daily update, the Ukrainian military's command said there had also been a wave of missile strikes on the Kherson, Kharkiv and Mykolaiv regions.\n\nAt least eight people - including a child - were injured in two villages in the southern Kherson region, local officials said.\n\nIn Zaporizhzhia, the head of the Russian installed administration, Vladimir Rogov, said Russian forces hit a warehouse and a Ukrainian troop position in the small city of Orikhiv.\n\nOn the eastern front, the Ukrainian commander of forces in the besieged eastern city of Bakhmut said Russian troops had stepped up shelling, in a bid to take the city by Tuesday's celebrations.\n\nRussian troops and fighters from the Wagner Group, a private military company, have been trying to capture Bakhmut for months - despite its questionable strategic value.\n\nOver the weekend, Wagner's founder Yevgeny Prigozhin appeared to U-turn on a threat to withdraw from the city after he was promised fresh ammunition supplies by the defence ministry in Moscow.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that 9 May would from now be celebrated as Europe Day, in line with the European Union. The move - which needs parliamentary approval - is seen as a pointed rebuke to Russia.\n\nMr Zelensky said he had signed a decree that the day would commemorate European unity and the defeat of \"Ruscism\" - a term that is shorthand for \"Russian fascism\".\n\nHe also said that 8 May would now officially be a Day of Remembrance and Victory, as marked in many countries around the world.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will hold talks with Mr Zelensky in Kyiv on Tuesday.\n\nMeanwhile, as Russia is preparing for Tuesday's Victory Day parade on Moscow's Red Square, the Kremlin is yet to reveal what President Vladimir Putin's role will be at the annual event.\n\nLast year, Mr Putin addressed the marching troops and was seen sitting among World War Two veterans in the VIP box.\n\nRussia says the leaders of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan - all former Soviet republics - are expected at the parade, which has been otherwise snubbed by major world countries, including the UK, the US and France - all wartime allies of the then Soviet Union.\n\nIn a separate development, a court in Berlin banned the carrying of Russian and Soviet flags during rallies at Soviet war memorials in the German capital on 9 May.\n\nStephen Lawrence was killed in April 1993, at Eltham in south-east London\n\nEarlier this week, the BBC publicly named a major suspect in the Stephen Lawrence murder. In response, Stephen's mother Baroness Doreen Lawrence said, \"It should not have taken a journalist to do the job that a huge, highly resourced institution should have done.\" Correspondent Daniel De Simone started investigating the case after the Metropolitan Police stopped.\n\nInvestigating the murder of Stephen Lawrence is a journey into the past and the present.\n\nStephen was murdered 30 years ago in a racist attack by a gang of young white men.\n\nTwo years ago, I set out to follow a lead which had the potential to bring significant new information to light.\n\nThe Met had stopped investigating Stephen's murder in 2020. I wanted to do what I could to investigate the outstanding suspects and hold them to account.\n\nI had no previous experience of covering the case and I felt daunted by it. Journalists had been covering the story since the 1990s, and there had been more than 15 police investigations or official inquiries. Who was I to imagine I could find anything new?\n\nThe lead I followed related to a man who was said to have possibly been there when Stephen was murdered. I was unsure whether this was as a witness or a suspect. I did not know the man's identity, and it took months to get a name. In the meantime, I read everything I could about Stephen's case.\n\nWhen", ", police have said.\n\nEmergency services were sent to an address on Gonhill in the West Cross area at about 13:30 BST on Saturday.\n\nThree people were taken to the city's Morriston Hospital where a 51-year-old man remains in a serious condition.\n\nSouth Wales Police said a girl, 13, and a woman, 39, suffered smoke inhalation and added that its investigation into the incident was ongoing.\n\nSiany Martin, whose home overlooks the house, described the people living there as a \"beautiful family\" who are \"loved by everyone\".\n\n\"All of us, the community, we're just praying for them we just want them to know that we're here. We're just sending our love to them,\" she said.\n\nFloral tributes and a teddy bear have been laid near the scene of the fire\n\nMs Martin said she heard a bang shortly after 13:00 BST, about five minutes after she had returned inside from watching planes fly over as part of the Swansea Air Show.\n\n\"I thought it was part of the air show, and then just heard screaming,\" she said.\n\n\"After that it's kind of a blur, just black smoke coming out, people running everywhere trying to do something.\"\n\nNeighbour Siany Martin said she heard \"screaming\" coming from the house\n\nThe exact circumstances of the fire, which was contained to one house, were not yet know, South Wales Police said.\n\nDet Insp Carl Price said: \"Our thoughts remain with the family and friends of the young boy who sadly died at a house fire in West Cross, Swansea.\"\n\nHe thanked members of the community who helped at the scene and those who came forward with information.\n\nA child has died and a man is in a serious condition in hospital\n\nSwansea council leader Rob Stewart described what happened as \"tragic\".\n\n\"Our thoughts, condolences and sympathies are with the family and friends at this very difficult time,\" he said on Facebook, adding that the council would \"assist and support\" those affected by the fire.\n\nCouncillor Rebecca Fogarty, who represents West Cross, said the community was in mourning.\n\nShe said: \"It's absolutely devastating news.

At the start of the season he predicted Leicester would struggle and needed to target 40 points to survive - they finished 18th and were relegated with 34 points.\n\nTurnover decreased to \u00a3177.3m - down from \u00a3214.6m the previous year - but chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha cleared the club's outstanding \u00a3194m debt to parent company King Power International last February.\n\nThe Foxes owed the amount in loans to KPI, which is owned by the Srivaddhanaprabha family, but a debt-to-equity transfer was completed.\n\n\"The long-term and ongoing financial security and commitment provided by Khun Aiyawatt, the Srivaddhanaprabha family and King Power International, enables the club to rebuild with certainty and confidence,\" added Whelan.\n\nThe release of Leicester's accounts comes 12 days after they were charged by the Premier League for alleged PSR breaches and for failing to submit audited finances.\n\nLeicester will have \"add backs\", which include spending on its women's team and the academy, which will bring their losses down in the Premier League's calculations, while they are reporting for 13 months rather than 12.\n\nThis was a long-term club decision to bring Leicester's accounting in line with the rest of the business.\n\nThe \u00a3215.3m loss over three years includes a \u00a333.1m pre-tax loss from the 2020-21 season, in which they lifted the FA Cup, and the club-record loss of \u00a392.5m a year later.\n\nIf found guilty of breaking spending rules, which allow clubs to average losses of \u00a335m per season in the Premier League, Leicester could face a points deduction.\n\nAs the case, including any appeals, is likely to run beyond the end of this season, it means any potential sanctions will be enforced next season.\n\nTop-flight sides Everton and Nottingham Forest have already been punished with points deductions this season for breaking rules.\n\nLeicester are also the subject of a separate financial probe by the English Football League (EFL), who followed up the Premier League charge by imposing a registration embargo on the East Midlands club.\n\nThe Foxes reacted by starting legal proceedings against both the EFL and Premier League.\n\nLeicester City have put the \u00a389.7m loss down to three key issues.\n\nFirst was the drop in Premier League prize money - as the club fell from eighth to 18th in the space of 12 months. That drop-off resulted in the club's relegation from the top flight, but also a reduction of about \u00a330-35m in prize money revenue.\n\nSecondly, there is the lack of European football after the club failed to qualify the previous season.\n\nAnd thirdly there is a clear message on the significant and \"costly\" price to move Brendan Rodgers and his backroom staff out of the club, exactly a year ago today.\n\nThis is a jaw-dropping amount of cash for a football club to lose. It is the result of Leicester trying to bridge the gap to the Premier League's top six - and failing in their recruitment of personnel and performances on the pitch.\n\nWhat is perhaps most significant is the amount of money clearly being spent on wages.

subjects she feels are relatable for everyone.\n\n\"Just because I make a specific joke and I look a certain kind of way, doesn't mean that everyone can't enjoy my comedy,\" she says.\n\n\"It's really important that people focus on the jokes and the writing and not on the person that's delivering those jokes.\"\n\nOla Labib worked as an NHS pharmacist before launching her comedy career\n\nOne person who knows that only too well is fellow comedian Ola Labib, who was also on the line-up for the event at the Hackney Empire.\n\n\"A lot of people say, 'you comedians only get to where you are because all you do is talk about race',\" Ola says.\n\nBut actually, it's jokes about Lord of the Rings which have become her calling card.\n\nShe's a practicing Muslim with Sudanese heritage and says before she started out in stand-up, she'd never been to a pub.\n\n\"The first time I ever went into a pub was when I did an open mic,\" says Ola.\n\nShe didn't know it then, but the event's promoter was as much of a Lord of the Rings fan as she was.\n\n\"I made an off comment, saying, 'I bet you've never seen a hijabi in a pub before.\n\n\"I think the last time anyone saw hooded figures going into a pub was Frodo at the Prancing Pony'.\"\n\nEven though she caveats the joke saying \"only nerds and losers will get it\", it got lots of laughs and has been included in her sets since and will also feature in her tour this summer.\n\nBut Ola thinks even though it's funny, what's funnier is audiences not expecting it to be a joke someone who looks like her would tell.\n\nOla and Kyrah were among eight comedians who performed at the 1Xtra Comedy Gala on Monday\n\nOla says she was the only African Muslim in her school and now she's in her 30s, she still doesn't see many people like her on the circuit.\n\nSometimes, she says, that adds a pressure to speak out about issues affecting her community.\n\nComedian and presenter Eddie Kadi, who hosted the event, says talking about race is something young comedians \"can't avoid\".\n\n\"I think what comedy needs to do is actually say that we should embrace our differences,\" he adds.\n\n\"Our differences are what make us all special.\n\n\"But you will be shocked the moment you open your mouth, how much similarity there is in the stories, and we should be able to tackle it head-on.\"\n\nEddie says the gala has been an important platform for the black comedy scene because \"other platforms are really hard to get on to\".\n\nBut more than a platform, he says events like the gala can act as a \"trampoline\" for underrepresented talent.\n\n\"There are just so many amazing, talented, young black women that are fighting to get their spot and fighting to be seen,\" adds Kyrah.\n\n\"There's always space for us and it's important that we keep highlighting that.\"\n\n1Xtra Comedy Gala with Eddie Kadi and Friends is now available to watch on BBC iPlayer or listen on BBC Sounds.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays -

Watch: \"It was consensual, but it was my fault,\" says Phillip Schofield.\n\nPhillip Schofield has said he is \"not a groomer\" after admitting to having an affair with a younger male colleague.\n\nThe former This Morning presenter left ITV last week after he confirmed the relationship and he had lied about it.\n\nThe TV star told the Sun: \"I did a bad thing: I will die sorry - I've brought the greatest misery into his totally innocent life.\"\n\nSchofield has also spoken to the BBC's Amol Rajan, whose interview will be broadcast from 06:00 BST on Friday.\n\nThe full interview will be available on iPlayer.\n\nThe 61-year-old first met the man he would go on to have an affair with when he was invited to appear at an event at a drama school.\n\nHe said he knew people had found some elements of the story shocking, but said: \"I am not a groomer.\"\n\nThe affair began, Schofield said, when the man was 20 years old and working alongside him at ITV.\n\n\"He worked on the show for a bit, and we became mates,\" Schofield told the newspaper.\n\n\"And then one", "ed comment to Rafiq, Adil Rashid, Ajmal Shahzad and Rana Naved-ul-Hasan because he was \"proud\" of it being the first time four Asian players had been in the same side for Yorkshire and it was a sign of how far the county had come.\n\nEngland spinner Rashid and former Yorkshire and Pakistan bowler Naved-ul-Hasan have corroborated Rafiq's allegation.\n\nThe fourth player in the group, former England bowler Shahzad has said he has no recollection of it happening.\n\nVaughan agreed that the alleged comment was unacceptable and racist, but insisted he did not say it, in part because it would have affected the morale of his team-mates and possibly their performance.\n\nVaughan also denied he had said the alleged comment in jest.\n\nWhen Mulcahy brought up some of the historical tweets sent by Vaughan - some of which include references to foreign call centre workers and the number of English people living in London - he did agree with that they would be offensive to Rafiq.\n\nHe said he took part in an online diversity course while working in Australia covering the 2021-22 Ashes because he \"wanted to be a leader in the game\".\n\nRafiq was accused of having said he was prepared to use the \"race card\" for personal gain by Matthew Wood, who was his personal development manager with the Professional Cricketers' Association (PCA).\n\nIn his witness statement, Wood claimed Rafiq said he would \"hit them with the race card\" if Yorkshire did not offer him a new contract during a meeting in August 2018.\n\nWood also alleged Rafiq \"used being Asian\" to get a place on an ECB coaching course despite missing the deadline.\n\nMulcahy said Wood did not include the 'race card' claim in his initial interview with the original Yorkshire investigation because \"Rafiq didn't play the race card\".\n\nRafiq's witness statement also said Wood's assertion of the coaching course discussion was an \"odd thing to claim\".\n\nWood said he did not mention it because \"it was such a volatile\" situation, but he did subsequently call the law firm to relay the 'race card' points and also told the PCA about the comments.\n\nMulcahy asked why Wood \"went behind\" Rafiq's back and suggested that he was \"at pains\" to support Vaughan in these proceedings \"no matter what\".\n\nWood said he disagreed and that he \"wasn't on anybody's side\".\n\nAmong the witnesses called on Friday was Meena Botros, the ECB's director of legal and integrity, who was in charge of the governing body's investigation into the allegations against Yorkshire.\n\nVaughan's lawyer, Christopher Stoner KC, criticised the ECB's handling of the investigation, questioning why it did not speak to everyone present in and around the Yorkshire team huddle, when Vaughan is alleged to have made the \"you lot\" comment in 2009.\n\nStoner asked why the ECB did not speak to the two umpires, the Sky cameraman recording the huddle and some of the other Yorkshire players in the team that day.\n\nBotros said \"no-one has suggested the umpires were close enough to hear it\" and Sky footage showed they \"weren't close to the huddle\".\n\nHe added there was also \"no suggestion\" the cameraman heard it, and it was \"assumed he would have had headphones on\".\n\nBotros said they \"weren't able\" to get contact details for some players and others either did not want to take part or had made their position \"very clear\".\n\nHe added he was \"not aware\" of Vaughan's legal team chasing up these lines of inquiry, saying: \"If you think it's such an important point then that may have been taken up.\"\n\nThe panel has yet to hear the ECB's cases against former Yorkshire captain Andrew Gale and ex-bowling coach Richard Pyrah, who have both withdrawn from the process.\n\nSo farewell to Credit Suisse. Founded in 1856, the bank has been a pillar of the Swiss financial sector ever since. Although buffeted by the financial crisis of 2008, Credit Suisse did manage to weather that storm without a government bailout, unlike its rival-turned-rescuer UBS.\n\nMore recently, the marketing face of Credit Suisse has been Switzerland's tennis god Roger Federer. He smiles down from posters at Swiss airports, a symbol of strength, excellence, staying power and reliability.\n\nBut behind the glossy promotion were some big problems. Divisive management, costly exposure to finance company Greensill Capital, which collapsed in 2021, a seedy money laundering case, and waning customer confidence in the last few months, which saw billions being withdrawn from the bank.\n\nAll it took to turn those doubts into a stampede was an apparently off the cuff remark from the Saudi National Bank, which owns almost 10% of Credit Suisse, suggesting it would not be increasing its investment.\n\nCredit Suisse's shares went into free fall, and even a statement of confidence from the Swiss National Bank, and an offer of $50bn (\u00a341bn) in financial support, couldn't stabilise the situation.\n\nHow could this have happened?\n\nAfter the financial crisis 15 years ago Switzerland introduced strict so-called \"too big to fail\" laws for its biggest banks. Never again, went the thinking, should the Swiss taxpayer have to bail out a Swiss bank, as happened with UBS.\n\nBut Credit Suisse is a \"too big to fail\" bank. In theory, it had the capital to prevent this week's catastrophe.\n\nAlso in theory Swiss financial regulators and the Swiss National Bank keep an eye on those systemically important banks and can intervene before disaster strikes.\n\nIt was odd, last week, to see the rest of the world reacting with real concern as Credit Suisse shares tumbled, and to hear, at first, nothing from Switzerland.\n\nRoger Federer went from winning prize money sponsored by Credit Suisse, to being its marketing figurehead\n\nEven the Swiss media seemed not to notice the headlines over at the Financial Times, and seemed more interested in the continued debate over how much support neutral Switzerland should be offering to Ukraine.\n\nBy the time people did notice, such damage had been done that Credit Suisse was beyond saving. The fallout had begun to threaten not just Switzerland's entire financial sector, but Europe's.\n\nAs the government met in emergency session to try to find a solution, you could almost smell the panic in Bern.\n\nAnnouncing the bank takeover, Swiss President Alain Berset said \"an uncontrolled collapse of Credit Suisse would lead to incalculable consequences for the country and the international financial system\".\n\nIt's hard to avoid the conclusion, some Swiss are now saying, that the very people who should have acted to prevent Credit Suisse's meltdown were asleep at the wheel.\n\nThat lack of attention is going to be very costly. UBS's takeover, for the paltry sum of $3bn (\u00a32.5bn), besides being an utter humiliation for Credit Suisse, is likely to leave its shareholders a good bit poorer.\n\nThere will also be job losses, perhaps in the thousands. There are Credit Suisse and UBS branches in just about every Swiss town. Once the takeover is complete, there will be little point in UBS keeping them all open.\n\nBut perhaps the most costly damage of all could be to Switzerland's reputation as a safe place to invest.\n\nDespite the scandals over the years related to the secret bank accounts of dictators (including Ferdinand Marcos from the Philippines, Congolese dictator Mobutu Sese Seko and many more), or the money laundering for drug lords and tax evaders, Swiss banks hung on to that reputation symbolised by Roger Federer: strong, and reliable.\n\nBut now? A system that allows a 167-year-old bank to go belly up, in the space of a few days, at the cost of many jobs and massive losses in share value?\n\nThat could cause huge reputational damage. The Swiss banking sector, Switzerland's financial regulators, and its government, all say the takeover is the best solution.\n\nIn the end, at the very last minute, it was the only solution. In the coming days, there will be some tough questions to answer.\n\nArtwork: The Blue Moon lander will be 16m tall and fully fuelled will weigh over 45 tonnes\n\n", "a screen reader - the phrase \"we're growing the economy\" repeated four times.\n\nBecky Brynolf, who's head of social media at the charity, tells Newsbeat she felt \"a bit of disappointment\" when she saw the tweet.\n\n\"I think that everyone should be able to access the same information.

That means two litres of liquid can be taken through, inside bags. Laptops can also be left in bags.\n\nThey are already used in some other countries including the US.\n\nTrials in the UK began in 2018, and airports have been gradually putting them in place. Some, including Teesside and London City Airport, have already finished their rollouts.\n\nHowever, London Gatwick, Heathrow and Manchester are all expected to need extra time to finish installing the new equipment across all their lanes.\n\nThat means some lanes will still use the current scanners for this year's summer holidays, so people will still need to stick to the 100ml liquid limits.\n\nAviation commentator Sally Gethin outlined some of the reasons for the delay.\n\n\"[The scanners] are very heavy. Sometimes the floors in the actual terminal have to be reinforced. The cost is really high for these particular scanners - it's the latest technology,\" she said, also pointing to supply chain issues and airports having to free up staff for training.\n\nConsumer group Which? said it was disappointing that major airports weren't ready\n\nHeathrow has already begun introducing the new equipment in three of its four terminals, but cannot guarantee the rollout will be complete by June.\n\nA source pointed out that Heathrow has 146 security lanes, more than any other UK airport, and the installation process had to be carefully managed to avoid hindering the flow of passengers.\n\nThe airport is understood to be working with the government on how passengers can be provided with \"clear messaging\".\n\nGatwick said it will have made \"significant progress\" in both terminals by June but does not expect to finish installation until early next year \"after the busy summer peak period has concluded\".\n\nConstruction work is under way at Manchester and East Midlands airports to expand terminals to accommodate the new equipment.\n\nA spokesperson for Manchester Airports Group said that while \"good progress\" was being made, completion of the programme is not expected until 2025.\n\nThe BBC understands the DfT may consider allowing airports extensions to complete installations across their whole premises where it deems it \"appropriate\".\n\nHowever, if they miss the deadline without permission, penalties are not being ruled out.\n\nRory Boland, travel editor at Which?, said: \"We're now going to go into a situation where different [UK] airports have different rules, so at some places you will need to get the liquids out in advance, at others you won't.\"\n\nHe said this could cause confusion and hold-ups at security. \"You only need a couple of passengers to not be prepared to end up having to wait an extra 10, 20, 30 minutes.\n\n\"It is disappointing that we're in a situation just months ahead of the peak travel period... and major airports aren't ready.\"\n\nMr Boland said airports' communication with passengers would be very important.\n\nTravel association Abta advised people planning holidays this summer to double check the rules at each end of their journey.\n\n\"It's important to remember that even if your departure airport in the UK has changed its rules around liquids when you travel later this year, you'll also need to check the rules that are in place for the airport you'll be returning from as they may be different,\" Abta said.\n\nA DfT spokesperson said: \"The UK has some of the most robust aviation security measures in the world and this cutting-edge technology will enhance security and boost the passenger experience.\n\n\"We are in regular contact with airports as they move towards [the] June 2024 deadline for upgrading their screening equipment and processes.

who sacked head coach Ian Foster on Monday after eight losses in 11 games - eased their own relegation fears with the win.\n\nIt moves them up to 19th in the Championship, four points from safety, and means the Millers return to League One with an unassailable 19-point gap to 21st-place Birmingham City with only 15 points left to play for.\n\nInterim Argyle boss Neil Dewsnip made four changes to his side, with all four dropping out being January signings by Foster as Dan Scarr and Callum Wright returned having barely featured under the former head coach.\n\nIn a first half that was low on quality, Argyle had the better of the chances - Wright twice went close after four Argyle players also threatened during a 10th-minute goalmouth scramble.\n\nMumba brought the game to life with a lovely touch to control Morgan Whittaker's precise cross-field pass from the right before blasting past Viktor Johansson to give the Pilgrims a lead they just about deserved.\n\nArgyle's confidence began to grow after the goal and Wright forced a smart save from Johansson with a low far-post header in first-half stoppage time.\n\nThe Millers had to be grateful to their Swedish keeper as time and again he saved them - he tipped Whittaker's powerful low effort around the post before stopping a Jordan Houghton shot.\n\nRotherham had their best chances midway through the second half as first Cohen Bramall hit the side netting having found himself unmarked at the back post from a corner before Sebastian Revan saw Michael Cooper produce his only save of the night soon after.\n\nJohansson again came to the rescue moments later after Cameron Humphreys had got a toe on an Adam Randell cross.\n\nHe then saved a Dan Scarr header from a corner that saw Waine head against the post from the follow up before the New Zealand striker missed a gilt-edged chance when he capitalised on Sebastian Revan's poor back-pass, but Johansson was off his line quickly to save with his foot as the Millers were relegated with a whimper.\n\nFour wins and 26 losses in nightmare Millers season\n\nRotherham have endured a dismal campaign, with just four wins and are guaranteed to finish bottom of the table.\n\nThey have failed to win a single match away from home all season and have not won a league match on their travels since November 2022.\n\nPrevious boss Matt Taylor was sacked in November when they were four points adrift of safety but replacement Leam Richardson could not turn their fortunes around and has won only two of his 21 league games in charge.\n\nThe South Yorkshire side dropped into the bottom three on 23 September and did not climb out of the relegation zone thereafter.\n\nTaylor, who had replaced long-serving Paul Warne in October 2022, kept the club in the second tier last season to end a run of six successive seasons where the club was either promoted to or relegated from the Championship.\n\nThis season was always likely to be a struggle for them and Taylor was sacked on 13 November, two days after a 5-0 reverse at Watford.\n\nBy the time Richardson was appointed on 11 December they had slipped to the foot of the division, a position they would remain in for the rest of the campaign.\n\nRichardson will now hope he is capable of doing what Warne managed after their three previous relegations and lead them straight back up - having led Wigan Athletic to the League One title in 2022.\n\n\"We weren't good enough tonight, I thought the game was very stop start.\n\n\"They shaded it in both boxes, which is the most disappointing thing, and I made my views clear at half-time.\n\n\"This club's experienced it a few times, they've always come back stronger, I feel for the fans at the minute because they've had a really rough season.\n\n\"Myself and [assistant] Rob Kelly came in at the back end of the year and it was there for all to see -

He was then seen being escorted from the building before being driven away.\n\nIn his most recent WSJ piece, published this week, Evan Gershkovich reported on Russia's declining economy and how the Kremlin was having to deal with \"ballooning military expenditures\" while maintaining social spending.\n\nPress freedom watchdog Reporters Without Borders said he had gone to Yekaterinburg to cover Russian mercenary group Wagner, which has taken part in some of the heaviest fighting in eastern Ukraine.\n\nHe has covered Russia for the Wall Street Journal for more than a year, having worked there previously for the AFP news agency and the Moscow Times. He began his career in the US.\n\nIn a statement, the Wall Street Journal said it stood in solidarity with the reporter and his family: \"The Wall Street Journal vehemently denies the allegations from the FSB and seeks the immediate release of our trusted and dedicated reporter, Evan Gershkovich.\"\n\nEvan Gershkovich has also worked for the Moscow Times and Agence France Presse\n\n\"This is the responsibility of the FSB, they have already issued a statement,\" said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. \"The only thing I can add is, as far as we know, he was caught red-handed.\"\n\nEven before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, reporting from Russia had become increasingly difficult.\n\nIndependent journalists were labelled \"foreign agents\" and BBC Russia correspondent Sarah Rainsford was expelled from the country.\n\nWhen the war began, Russia introduced a criminal offence for reporting \"fake news\" or \"discrediting the army\", under which dozens of Russians have been convicted for criticising the invasion on social media.\n\nAlmost all independent media were silenced, shut down or blocked, including major outlets TV Rain, Echo of Moscow radio and newspaper Novaya Gazeta. Many Western media chose to leave Russia.\n\nRussian political expert Tatyana Stanovaya said Mr Gershkovich's detention had come as a shock. In the FSB's view of espionage, \"collecting information\" could simply mean gathering comments from experts, she said, while acting on US instructions could simply refer to his editors at the Wall Street Journal.\n\nRussian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said what a Wall Street Journal employee was doing in Yekaterinburg had \"nothing to do with journalism\".\n\nIt was not the first time the status of \"foreign correspondent\" had been used to \"cover up activities that are not journalism\", she said.\n\nTensions between the Kremlin and the West have become increasingly tense in the 13 months of Russia's war in Ukraine. Reporters Without Borders said it was \"alarmed by what looks like retaliation\".\n\nSeveral US citizens are being held in Russia. Days before the invasion, American basketball star Brittney Griner was detained at a Moscow airport and jailed for carrying cannabis oil. It was 10 months before she was freed in exchange for notorious Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout.\n\nRussian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told local news agencies that it was too early to discuss prisoner swaps.\n\n\"I would not even put the question in this plane now, because you understand that some exchanges that happened in the past took place for people who were already serving sentences,\" he said.\n\nPatrick Thelwell, 23, was found guilty after a trial at York Magistrates' Court.\n\nA man who threw five eggs at King Charles during a visit to York has been found guilty of a public order offence.\n\nPatrick Thelwell hurled the eggs towards the King and Queen Consort as they arrived at Micklegate Bar on 9 November. All five of the eggs missed.\n\nThe 23-year-old was found guilty after a trial at York Magistrates' Court.\n\nThelwell, who represented himself during the hearing, admitted throwing the eggs, but he claimed it was \"lawful violence\".\n\nSenior District Judge Paul Goldspring found the defendant guilty of threatening behaviour, saying he had \"intended to cause King Charles to believe immediate unlawful violence would be used against him\".\n\nThelwell, who was a student at the University of York at the time of the offence, was given a 12-month community order with 100 hours of unpaid work and ordered to pay costs of \u00a3600 and a \u00a3114 surcharge at a rate of \u00a35 per week.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nMichael Smith, prosecuting, said that as the eggs were thrown, Thelwell shouted offensive remarks about the King, which included accusing the monarch of being \"friends with Jimmy Savile\".\n\nHe said Thelwell was also wearing high-heeled shoes and that he told police this allowed him to see the King through the crowd.\n\nBody-worn camera footage of Thelwell's arrest, which was played in court, showed Thelwell saying: \"I threw an egg at him because that's what he deserved.\n\n\"It's the only justice victims of colonialism will get.\"\n\nHe also asked: \"Did I get him? Next time, someone will.\"\n\nThe court heard that Thelwell signed a custody form after his arrest with an obscenity and a drawing of an egg.\n\nDuring the trial Thelwell asked Det Con Peter Wilson, giving evidence: \"Do you think throwing eggs is serious violence? More than the violence carried out by the British state?\"\n\nDet Con Wilson said he did believe throwing eggs could be violent, but could not comment further.\n\nThelwell said he had worn high-heeled shoes to give him a better view of the King\n\nThelwell told the court his defence was \"that my actions towards the King were lawful violence rather than unlawful violence\".\n\nHe said he disputed the legitimacy of the court to try him as he said the Crown Prosecution Service worked for the monarchy and that he had \"acted out of necessity\".\n\nThelwell criticised the UK's asylum and climate policies, as well as social inequalities, which he said had been worsened by government policies.\n\n\"Hundreds of people have contacted me to say they would have done the same thing and they would do the same thing if the King visited their community,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking outside York Magistrates' Court before the verdict, Thelwell had said he had \"no regrets and no apology to the King\".\n\nSentencing Thelwell, senior district judge Paul Goldspring said: \"This was a gratuitous and pernicious act, particularly the pejorative comments made about the King.\n\n\"But the level of violence I accept was low. This", ".\"\n\nNobody has been convicted of Daniel Morgan's murder\n\nThirty-seven documents spanning 95 pages that should have been disclosed to the panel led by Baroness O'Loan were found in the locked cabinet at New Scotland Yard in January and an assessment started in February, the Met said.\n\nThe force also admitted a further 23 documents across 71 pages should have been shared with the police watchdog, which in a separate March 2022 report found the Met's approach to tackling corruption within its ranks to be \"fundamentally flawed\" .\n\nA spokesperson for the Mayor of London said: \"This is clearly unacceptable and should never have happened.\"\n\nNo-one has been convicted over father-of-two Mr Morgan's death, with the Metropolitan Police previously admitting corruption hampered the original murder investigation and apologising to his family.\n\nHis family believes the police corruption, and reluctance to confront it, could explain the murder and the failed investigations into the killing.\n\nAlthough Mr Morgan's brother Alastair says he is not surprised by the latest development, he puts it down to \"incompetence [and] error\" rather than malice.\n\nAlastair Morgan has spent 36 years campaigning for justice for his brother\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio London, he said: \"I'm despairing of the police but, again, that's really nothing new for me.\n\n\"It's not like this has shaken me to the core or anything like that - it's just same old, same old.\"\n\nMr Morgan, from Llanfrechfa near Cwmbran in South Wales, died outside the Golden Lion pub in Sydenham on 10 March 1987.\n\nThe police watchdog review last year found then-Met Police chief Dame Cressida Dick may have breached professional standards between 2013-15, when she was an assistant commissioner, by obstructing the work of an inquiry into the case - something she denied.\n\nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said Dame Cressida appeared to have \"acted in the genuine belief she had a legitimate policing purpose\", due to concerns about protecting information but \"may have got it wrong\".\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

It was also impacted by Covid lockdowns in China which hit consumer access to products.\n\nTupperware has been trying to change its image from house parties in years gone by to younger shoppers\n\nMr Saunders also said that Tupperware - while considered innovative many years ago - was perhaps not as inventive and stylish as other brands such as Joseph Joseph, the home goods design company started by twin brothers Antony and Richard Joseph.\n\nYounger customers have also embraced more environmentally-friendly products such as beeswax paper to keep food fresh which can be used again and again, he said.\n\nTupperware had seen a resurgence during the Covid pandemic as people cooked for themselves at home and its share price surged, but sales have slid since then.\n\nIn a statement, Tupperware said that its shares were in danger of being delisted from the New York Stock Exchange because it had not yet filed its annual report.\n\nIt also warned that it had to renegotiate its loans after already amending its loan agreements three times since August 2022.\n\nTupperware said it was struggling with higher interest costs on its borrowings while it attempts to turn the business around.\n\nThe company said it \"currently forecasts that it may not have adequate liquidity in the near term\", adding that it \"has therefore concluded that there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern\".\n\nJust a month ago, Tupperware's chief financial officer Mariela Matute, who joined the company in May last year, told investors: \"We're confident that we will be able to operate without substantial doubt in 2023.\"\n\nIn addition, Tupperware said that its financial results for 2021 and 2022 as well its interim figures in 2021 and the first three months of 2022 had been \"misstated\" due to how the firm accounted for taxes and leases.\n\nTupperware's share price rose by 5.6% on Tuesday after dropping by nearly 50% on Monday.\n\nThe company said it was working with financial advisers to secure more money and investment. It is also examining whether it can sell property and cut jobs.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: How the Tupperware party became a million dollar idea\n\nMr Saunders said it was doubtful whether Tupperware could do enough now to turn itself around. He said that if the company had made changes 10 years ago, such as selling in shops or through wholesale, it may be in a different position now.\n\nHowever, the brand name is still well-known, he said, and the company could appeal to a retail giant such as Walmart - which used to own Asda - or even Amazon.\n\nTupperware was founded by Earl Tupper, an American chemist, in 1946.\n\nThe polyethylene air-tight and water-tight products - with their double-sealed lid - were sold in department stores but were not immediately successful because potential customers were not sure how to use them.\n\nPeople were used to glass and ceramic products and the new Tupperware container had to be \"burped\" to expel air when being sealed.\n\nA saleswoman called Brownie Wise - who was already selling cleaning products door-to-door at home parties - started selling Tupperware herself.\n\nShe used home demonstrations to find customers and recruited other salespeople to sell the goods.\n\nShe was recruited as a vice president of marketing at Tupperware by Mr Tupper, helping to fuel growth at the business through parties which also allowed women to earn an income.\n\nHowever, the founder and his vice president reportedly clashed over strategy and in 1958, Mr Tupper fired Mrs Wise. She sued the company", "councillors to resign from the party, told BBC North West Today: \"In the last few weeks there has been a culture developing from the national Labour Party that seems to want to control anything that any councillor wants to say.\"\n\nHe added: \"The party nationally seems to want to control who can stand where and when.

If so, the most obvious upgrade from her current role as finance and economy secretary would be to deputy first minister.\n\nThat's not a prediction. Just an observation. I expect that whatever she might be offered, Kate Forbes would want a fair amount of autonomy if she is to continue in government.\n\nIf he can reach an agreement with her, that could go some way to easing tensions.\n\nThen of course there are significant policy issues to be addressed. Not least the Scottish government's response to the UK blocking the gender recognition reform bill.\n\nAt the start of the leadership contest Humza Yousaf seemed committed to challenging that position in court. More recently, he has left a little more room for manoeuvre by saying he would be guided by the legal advice he receives.\n\nWhile his power-sharing partners in the Greens will be looking for a robust approach, that could risk prolonging divisions in his own party. Careful handling is required.\n\nHumza Yousaf noted in his acceptance speech that delivering independence is the shared goal that unites the SNP.\n\nWhile that is substantially true, it may not be the only factor. It seems to me electoral success and the strong leadership of Alex Salmond and then Nicola Sturgeon have also had a binding effect.\n\nIt is not yet clear whether Humza Yousaf can maintain their grip.\n\nHis approach to the independence question will also be important.\n\nWhile he has distanced himself from the idea of using the next election as a substitute referendum, he has promised to renew calls for the UK government to give Holyrood the power to hold a vote.\n\nThat may help to underline his commitment to the cause but it is not likely to alter Rishi Sunak's response, which has been to reject indyref2.\n\nHe also risks sending out a mixed message to the wider Scottish public.\n\nHumza Yousaf has promised to be a first minister for everyone in Scotland and to earn the trust and respect of those who are not persuaded on independence by governing well and focusing on shared priorities.\n\nIf the first thing he does is to formally demand another independence referendum, he may struggle to convince some that he is serious about those commitments.\n\nHe has said dealing with cost of living pressures and NHS recovery will be his first concerns.\n\nThese are another two massive challenges that suggest the new first minister's honeymoon period in office, if he gets one, may be particularly short.\n\nAfter being voted leader of the Scottish National Party, we ask -

Back to the present, if you like, after 10 days of Westminster being consumed by looking at Boris Johnson\u2019s conduct in the rear view mirror. The government is in a bind: it is desperate to get inflation down, and yet it is stuck. It is desperate to be able to point to a sense of people feeling better off. But getting inflation down will make many people feel worse off - because the Bank of England cranking up interest rates is a key way to do it. Those timeless trade offs of economics and politics never go away. What is different this time \u2014 courtesy of the government\u2019s colossal interventions in the last few years around Covid and soaring energy bills due to the war in Ukraine \u2014 is there is arguably a greater expectation ministers can or should intervene again. This expectation, or hope, extends to some Tory MPs. The former party chairman Sir Jake Berry has called, for instance, for the return of Mortgage Interest Tax Relief at Source - a Conservative policy in the 1980s and 90s. The Chancellor has rejected this idea. Privately, some ministers and Conservative MPs are exasperated, arguing that not only does there have to be a limit to what government can do and can afford, but a large scale intervention would make inflation worse.\n\nAt least one police officer was assaulted every day in the first four months of this year in the north west, a senior officer has said.\n\nEight officers were assaulted in four separate incidents in Londonderry on Wednesday evening.\n\nCh Insp Yvonne McManus said so many assaults in one evening was \"exceptional for our district\".\n\nBut she said officers are increasingly being subjected to attacks.\n\n\"In relation to where we are as a district, and I know Derry City and Strabane is no exception, between January and April we have had 34.5 assaults per month - that is more than one officer assaulted per day,\" she told BBC Radio Foyle's The North West Today programme.\n\n\"Increasingly our officers are subject to attacks and we are here to help deal with extremely complex issues - issues around vulnerability - and regrettably we are forced to try and resolve these and at time officers are exposed to serious risk themselves\".\n\nCh Insp McManus said the eight officers injured on Wednesday had all been able to remain on duty.\n\nThree people have been charged to court and another reported to the Public Prosecution Service in relation to the incidents on Wednesday, she added.\n\nCh Insp McManus urged the public not to take officers for granted.\n\n\"At times they are dealing with very dangerous circumstances and they put themselves in harm's way to protect others and keep the community safe,\" she said.\n\nEarlier this year the PSNI said assaults resulting in injuries to officers are at a five-year high.\n\nAt that time the Police Federation for Northern Ireland, which represents officers, said greater deterrents - including tougher sentencing by the court and the use of Tasers - are needed to prevent assaults on officers.\n\nSign up for notifications to the latest Insight features via the BBC Sport app and find the most recent in the series.\n\n\"It was all I thought about and dreamed about.

I didn't really care about football at that time,\" Gorry told BBC Sport.\n\n\"For as long as I can remember, I thought I would have to hang up the boots to start a family.\n\n\"But I knew I was in the right place. I knew that I wanted to be pregnant and I wanted to have a little one. And everything fell into place.\n\n\"The national team were super supportive. They said they would be there if I wanted to return to football.

Afterwards I started thinking about getting back to the game.\n\n\"I felt like I loved it more than I ever had before.\"\n\nGorry embarked on a journey as a single mother while playing for Brisbane Roar in 2021, before meeting her current partner Clara.\n\nThey now live in London after Gorry joined West Ham in January from Swedish club Vittsjo GIK, having made a return to football only three months after giving birth to daughter Harper, who is now two.\n\nGorry achieved her football dream, helping Australia reach the semi-finals of the World Cup on home soil in 2023, and she has more excitement to come - Clara is expecting a baby boy.\n\n\"I'm known more as Harper's mum now than as a football player - that's the most special part,\" said Gorry, who is currently recovering from a season-ending ankle injury.\n\n\"I wanted to be a mum for so long. I knew Harper was going to be special just because of how much I wanted her. I had her alone and we got to develop the most incredible relationship.\"\n\nIt has not been easy for Gorry. She wasn't sure if she could juggle life as a professional footballer and motherhood. It is not something that is widely spoken about outside of the United States.\n\nIn November 2022 England striker Toni Duggan told BBC Sport: \"I don't think women's football is ready for women to be pregnant.\"\n\nA BBC Sport study released in March found that a third of British sportswomen surveyed said they had delayed starting a family because of their sporting career.\n\nBut Gorry embraced motherhood, moving to Sweden when Harper was six months old and facing challenges like going to the supermarket in a foreign country and trying to find the right baby food.\n\n\"I remember getting there for the first three weeks and thinking 'gosh, what have I got myself into?' The club were incredible. But it was scary,\" added Gorry.\n\nShe was driving to a Women's Super League game this year, preparing to face Manchester United, when Harper was sick in the back seat of the car. Gorry called West Ham boss Rehanne Skinner immediately.\n\n\"There was no panic in her voice whatsoever. It was like 'You just do what you need to do. We'll be here when you need us. We have everything ready,'\" said Gorry.\n\n\"Pretty much as soon as I walked in the dressing room everyone got around me. All the girls asked if Harper was OK and if I needed anything.

We have the direct involvement of Mr Morgan in a number of these incidents.\"\n\nMr Morgan was Daily Mirror editor from 1995 until 2004.\n\nMr Sherborne said the alleged unlawful activities also included MGN journalists intercepting landline voicemails, even if the phone numbers were ex-directory - meaning they were not listed in the telephone directory and the phone company would not provide them to those who asked for them.\n\nClaims brought by Harry and three others are being heard in the trial, expected to last six to seven weeks, as being \"representative\" cases of the types of allegations facing the publisher.\n\nThe other claimants are former Coronation Street actors Nikki Sanderson and Michael Turner, known by his stage name Michael Le Vell, and comedian Paul Whitehouse's ex-wife Fiona Wightman.\n\nThey are all expected to give evidence - when the prince does so in June, he will become the first senior member of the Royal Family to appear in court and be cross-examined in modern times.\n\nThe four cases were chosen by the trial judge to help the court set the level of damages MGN should pay if the claimants win, as well as establish the various allegations facing the publisher.\n\nThe court would then consider other cases from celebrities including the former Girls Aloud singer Cheryl, actor Ricky Tomlinson, former Arsenal and England footballer Ian Wright and the estate of late singer-songwriter George Michael.\n\nMGN has denied the allegations, including those of voicemail interception.\n\nIn its defence against some of the claims made by Prince Harry, MGN's lawyers argued that he did not have \"a reasonable expectation of privacy\".\n\nThis argument was made in response to articles about his relationship with Chelsy Davy - the break-up of which Harry blamed on press intrusion, his alleged drug use and one that reported he was forced to carry out farm work as punishment for wearing a Nazi uniform to a party.\n\nIn other instances it claimed published information was \"limited and banal\".\n\nIn response to one of the 33 articles put forward by Prince Harry's legal team, which gave details about his 18th birthday celebrations, MGN lawyers argued that the information came from an interview the duke gave to the Press Association.\n\nThe article published under the headline \"No Eton trifles for Harry, 18\" in September 2002 \"simply repeated the details that the claimant [Harry] had given\" including that he would not be having a party and would be spending the day with his father and brother, MGN argues in court documents. It said there was \"no evidence of voicemail interception\".\n\nHowever on Wednesday, the publisher acknowledged and \"unreservedly\" apologised for a separate instance of unlawful information gathering against Harry, adding that the legal challenge brought by the prince \"warrants compensation\".\n\nOn Thursday, reporters saw the list of 33 stories at the heart of Prince Harry's claim for damages against MGN. He is relying on them to prove phone hacking and other unlawful activity against him.

Watch: \"I've never hacked a phone, I wouldn't even know how\" - Piers Morgan (interview filmed in March)\n\nIn Thursday's hearing, Mr Sherborne discussed a Daily Mirror front page story from 1999, which revealed confidential details about the finances of Prince Michael of Kent - cousin of the late Queen Elizabeth II - including that he was in debt to a bank.\n\nPrince Michael's lawyers later told MGN they had deduced that a \"blagger\" had called the bank and, posing as the royal's accountant, obtained confidential information.\n\nMGN eventually settled the claim, published an apology and paid his legal costs, the barrister said.\n\n\"It's inconceivable, given the way this progressed, that the legal department and Mr Morgan were not well aware of the source of the story, and that it came from illegally obtained information,\" Mr Sherborne told the court.\n\nMr Morgan has consistently denied any knowledge of phone hacking during his time editing the newspaper, but this will be the first time a court has been asked to rule on claims about what he knew.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC's Amol Rajan before the trial began, Mr Morgan said he could only talk to what he knew about his own involvement, adding: \"I've never hacked a phone, I wouldn't even know how.\"\n\nMr Morgan also pointed out he only worked for the Daily Mirror and had no responsibility for the Sunday Mirror, Sunday People or other titles.\n\nIn 2015, MGN admitted journalists had regularly used unlawful techniques to obtain private information - and issued a public apology.\n\nThe High Court ordered the publisher to pay out damages totalling \u00a31.25m to eight phone-hacking victims, including more than \u00a3260,000 to the actor Sadie Frost.\n\nThe first minister said there was a high threshold for criminality in the new law\n\nHumza Yousaf said he was \"not surprised\" police had assessed JK Rowling's online posts challenging the new hate crime law to be non-criminal.\n\nThe Harry Potter author described several transgender women as men, including convicted prisoners, trans activists and other public figures.\n\nThe legislation creates a crime of \"stirring up hatred\" relating to protected characteristics.\n\nBut Police Scotland said no action would be taken against Ms Rowling.\n\nThe first minister said the Hate Crime and Public Order (Scotland) Act 2021 \"protects the most vulnerable and marginalised in our in society\" while also safeguarding \"freedom of expression and freedom of speech\".\n\nMr Yousaf told BBC Scotland News: \"Those new offences that have been created by the act have a very high threshold for criminality.\n\n\"The behaviour has", "to recover from the trauma of losing Harry, Derek turned his attention to investigating East Kent, one of the largest hospital trusts in England.\n\nBeing one step removed from the loss allowed Derek to have \"the helicopter view\", he says.\n\nThe \"grandfather effect\", as he describes it, was what made it possible to focus his fire on the NHS. Being one step removed from the loss allowed him to have \"the helicopter view\", he says. \"You're not as close to the grief of losing your child. But by the same token, you're grieving your grandchild and also seeing the devastation which has happened to your children, which is just dreadful and ongoing.\"\n\nOne of the key documents Derek uncovered was a report from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG), whose experts had been invited into the trust in November 2015 to assess maternity care. It was damning. Among the findings were that some consultants did not carry out ward rounds, review women, attend out-of-hours calls when requested or complete mandatory training.\n\nDerek found that report had led to a Maternity Improvement Plan overseen by NHS England, but the trust's board papers - which he pored over for hours, weeks on end - showed the problems continued into 2016 and 2017.\n\nIn other words, managers and external regulators knew there were problems in the trust, particularly at the QEQM Hospital. He asks: \"Who followed it up, at the trust, at NHS England?\"\n\nThe one agency that did not know about the RCOG report was the Care Quality Commission (CQC) - which inspects health and social care providers. Derek had written to the CQC to inform it of Harry's death and the problems surrounding it.\n\nThe commission's initial response was to thank him, but to say it would be taking no further action as it appeared his grandson's death had been because of the poor skills of one doctor - the locum who carried out the C-section.\n\nBut Derek persisted and changed the CQC's view of the trust. This eventually led, in June 2021, to East Kent being fined more than \u00a3700,000 for failing to provide both Harry and Sarah with safe care and treatment.\n\nIn October 2019, three months before Harry's inquest was due to take place, Derek decided he had uncovered deep-seated problems at the trust and only publicity was likely to bring change. He saw my coverage of an inquest into the death of 14-year-old Amy Allan, which found significant failings by Great Ormond Street Hospital, and sent me an email.\n\nThe Richford family in January 2020 - at the end of Harry's inquest which concluded his death had been\"wholly avoidable\"\n\nI spent three months with a colleague looking into the East Kent trust. In January 2020 we reported there were significant problems with its maternity services, including the potentially-avoidable deaths of seven babies.\n\nThe coroner at Harry's inquest later that month concluded his death had been\"wholly avoidable\". The family stood outside the court in front of the cameras, tears gently rolling down cheeks, arms and hands tightly gripped around each other. They had achieved their primary aim - justice for Harry.\n\nWithin three weeks of the inquest concluding - and with more serious concerns emerging - NHS England appointed Dr Bill Kirkup to carry out an independent investigation into maternity care at East Kent.\n\nThe publicity led to other families getting in touch with us - and seeking advice from Derek - telling their own stories of poor outcomes. Because he has become viewed as the chief instigator of the inquiry, people randomly contact Derek and - without warning - launch into detailed and often horrific details of what happened in their own case.\n\nDerek says his coping mechanism has been blogging on the web - writing in general terms about the conversations he has had with families, and offering possible useful advice.\n\n\"Writing it down, getting it out of my head and onto a page, I found really useful,\" he says.\n\n\"It has, at times, been quite lonely. At times you have to walk a tightrope between what is right for other families and what's right for me. More importantly however, is what is right for Tom and Sarah.\"\n\nDespite those tensions, Derek says he does not have any regrets about the past few years - but says he cannot answer for Harry's parents, who might feel differently.\n\n\"When I started investigating what was going on with Harry, it was very much like peeling back an onion. 'Hang on a minute, that can't be right, that doesn't add up.' Ever since I was a small kid, justice has been so important to me.\n\n\"What I found was that, up to that point, no-one had ever joined the dots. And that's so important. I think this had to happen, someone had to do it. There will be families before us that wish they did it. We will be saving a level of families after us.\"\n\nBut it was not just other families who had not joined the dots - lawyers raising repeated individual clinical negligence cases against the trust, charities offering bereavement support, as well as NHS regulators, all failed to see what was happening.\n\nFor a skilled, determined, campaigner like Derek - who has spent so much time pushing forward, lobbying and cajoling - it can sometimes be difficult for him to see how far he has come and how much he has achieved.\n\nThe trust has, after all, offered a fulsome apology for its actions in relation to Harry, admitting in June 2021 it had \"failed\" his parents. While it acknowledged it had more to do, the trust also said at the time that it had more doctors and better training. And it has of course had to expose itself to a team of experts crawling over its maternity services.\n\nIn his garden in rural Kent, I ask Derek if he has had time to reflect on his achievements. He looks away and, for the first time, struggles to answer. His voice breaks, he sniffles slightly. \"I would like to think that we as a family have done Harry proud,\" he says eventually. \"And that I've done Tom and Sarah proud.\"\n\nEvacuees with soldiers boarding an evacuation flight in Sudan\n\nThe final UK evacuation flight has now left Sudan, the government has announced.\n\nIt had said previously the last flight would leave on Wednesday, with British officials who have been working on the evacuation expected to be on board.\n\nAn update by the Foreign Office said the last flight had left Port Sudan and that no more would be running.\n\nThe airlift - which began amid a tentative ceasefire last week - has seen more than 2,300 people rescued.\n\nThose taken to safety included Britons, their dependents, Sudanese NHS staff and other eligible nationalities.\n\nA renewed 72-hour ceasefire was due to end at midnight local time on Wednesday. The Foreign Office had warned that, following the end of the agreement, violence in the country could escalate.\n\nDozens of people were evacuated on flights that left Sudan on Wednesday.\n\nThe country - the third largest in Africa - was plunged into crisis after fighting broke out between rival military factions on 15 April.\n\nHundreds have been killed, according to official figures, but it is feared the actual death toll is much higher, and tens of thousands have already been displaced in a growing humanitarian crisis.\n\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said the UK's focus would shift to providing humanitarian aid, though he warned that any continuing conflict was likely to impede relief efforts.\n\n\"We have given aid to Sudan, we are giving support to countries in the region, we will continue to push for an extension of the ceasefire and a permanent end to the conflict because that is the best way to maximise the effectiveness of our humanitarian support,\" he said.\n\nForeign Office advice for British nationals still hoping to leave Sudan is that unscheduled chartered ships will be operating from Port Sudan to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia.\n\nIt also states that British Embassy staff remain temporarily available on the Egyptian side of the Egypt-Sudan border to provide support.\n\nThe UK government joined other countries in evacuating citizens from Sudan after the commercial airport was taken out of action by fighting and communication networks went down.\n\nInitial evacuation flights organised by the British military left from an airstrip close to the capital Khartoum", "-to-day activities.\n\nThey will also be able to take into account the wider geographical impact of protests, rather than just the impact on people who live and work in the area.\n\nHome Secretary Suella Braverman said this would \"clearly define\" when police can step in to stop \"selfish\" protesters \"wreaking havoc in people's everyday lives\".\n\nThe legislation will have to be approved by the Commons and Lords before it takes effect, a process that normally takes several weeks.\n\nIt follows government efforts to beef up broader police powers to tackle protests in the Public Order Bill, which recently passed through Parliament and will become law shortly.\n\nMinisters tried to ban slow walking protests by adding measures to the bill in the Lords, but were narrowly defeated by peers.\n\nBecause of the way the measures were introduced, they could not be added back to the bill at a later stage.\n\nThe bill creates a new criminal offence for people who try to lock themselves to objects or buildings.\n\nThe government says it will allow the police to more effectively tackle \"disruptive and dangerous\" tactics used by protesters, but it has been heavily criticised by civil rights groups.\n\nOn Wednesday, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk described the legislation as \"deeply troubling\".\n\nIt imposed restrictions on freedom of expression and peaceful assembly that were \"neither necessary nor proportionate\", he said.\n\nBJ Harrington, the National Police Chiefs' Council lead for public order and public safety, said: \"Policing is not anti-protest, but there is a difference between protest and criminal activism, and we are committed to responding quickly and effectively to activists who deliberately disrupt people's lives through dangerous, reckless and criminal acts.\n\n\"It is the responsibility of Parliament to make the law and our job to enforce it.\"\n\nComplaints from students in England and Wales about their university courses reached a record high last year.\n\nMore than a third of the 2,763 complaints to the Office of the Independent Adjudicator (OIA) were related to the impact of pandemic.\n\nThe amount of compensation given to students exceeded \u00a31.3m, it said.\n\nA report suggested that staffing issues, industrial action, and delays in submitting complaints from 2020 were behind the high figures.\n\nAs a result of the Covid pandemic \"some students found that they weren't getting the learning experiences that they reasonably expected\" said the OIA.\n\nIt said this explained in part why the total number of complaints submitted in 2021 was 6% higher than the year before.\n\nBy far the largest category were complaints about how courses were delivered.\n\nSome students complained about being unable to access in-person facilities like laboratories, while others were unable to pursue their studies abroad.\n\nMany complained about staffing issues, including poorly prepared substitute teachers and key experts in their field leaving the university.\n\nThe increased dependence on remote learning was also an issue, with many highlighting technical failures affecting their learning.\n\n\"Some students struggled with digital literacy, especially in online timed exams,\" the report added. \"For others their limited typing skills affected their performance.\"\n\nThe National Union of Students (NUS) said \"digital poverty\" was a big issue for some students and many others were struggling financially - with some using food banks and buy-now-pay-later loans for support.\n\nAn NUS official said the high number of complaints was \"no surprise\" and students were \"at breaking point\".\n\nComplaints in the report that were considered \"justified\", at least in part, include:\n\nOne case that resulted in just over \u00a368,000 worth of compensation, the highest figure that was awarded, the report said.\n\nBut other students found the move to remote education had made learning easier, with disabled students benefiting in particular.\n\n\"Students told us that they valued having more control over how and when they could access their learning experience,\" the OIA said.\n\nIn addition to the high number of total complaints, the OIA said the compensation awarded was \"significantly higher\" than previous years.\n\nIt suggested this may have been because the pandemic sometimes made it challenging to find practical solutions to complaints.\n\nPhD and postgraduate students were overrepresented in the complaint logs, submitting just under half of them despite accounting for 27% of the English and Welsh student population.\n\nResponding to the report, Universities UK said the high number of complaints was concerning but stressed it represented only \"a small fraction of the total student population\".\n\nThe organisation, which represents universities, said its members had responded well to the highly disruptive impact of Covid.\n\n\"The overwhelming majority of students continue to receive a world-class education,\" it said.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Karen Rogers has had to wear a prosthetic breast for six years after surgery delays\n\nA breast cancer survivor has said she feels \"cast aside\" due to reconstructive surgery being postponed three times this year.\n\nKaren Rogers, 57, from Magor, Monmouthshire, was given a mastectomy six years ago, but delays mean she is still waiting.\n\nShe said the wait affects everything from the clothes she wears to the way she hugs people.\n\nThe Welsh government said some cancer services were taking longer to recover.\n\nMs Rogers said: \"I know it's a lump of flesh and there are people going through far worse things.\"\n\n\"But I just want to look normal. It won't be a normal boob when I get it - it'll be lumpy and bumpy - but it will be mine. I'll be back to some sort of the old Karen.\"\n\nMs Rogers's surgery was already delayed several times before the three postponements in 2023.\n\nAfter the mastectomy on her left breast in December 2016, reconstruction was deferred until after cancer treatment.\n\nShe then needed stomach surgery to rule out a specific growth, and once she recovered, the Covid-19 pandemic hit.\n\nProsthetic breasts can help women disguise the surgery they've had following a mastectomy, but don't always stay in position\n\nThe surgery, known as deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP), is only performed in one Welsh health board - Swansea Bay - and takes skin from the stomach to create a new breast.\n\nOperations deferred by the Covid pandemic restarted last year.\n\nBut a planned nurses' strike, concerns over Ms Rogers's white blood cell count and another patient needing an immediate reconstruction has led to more waiting.\n\nWhile she said priority must be given to cancer patients, she said she felt \"cast aside\".\n\nShe has worn a prosthetic for the past six and a half years, either stuck to her skin \"like a big plaster\" or placed in a pocket of special bras.\n\n\"I don't swim any more - I've got two little grandsons my daughter wants me to go swimming with, but I can't. I'm just too self-conscious.\"\n\nEven her hugs are done from the right side, she said, because she does not want people to notice the \"rock-solid\" prosthetic on the left.\n\nJo Woolnough decided to pay for the second stage of her breast surgery rather than wait three to four years\n\nJo Woolnough, 44, from Swansea, waited four years for her breast construction, which she had in August 2022.\n\nShe said: \"You try and get on with your life and you console yourself by thinking 'well I'm here, I'm lucky I survived' but after a while you can't hold on to that anymore because that lack of a breast affects you so strongly.\"\n\nBut the reconstruction left her with one side at a C-cup and the other at an F to an E-cup, leading her to feel self-conscious and stuffing \"teddy-bear filling\" in her bra.\n\nShe was then told it would be another three to four years for a reduction of her surviving breast so they would be the same size, which she described as \"soul destroying\".\n\n\"I was so elated from having the first surgery and thinking 'I'm nearly done, I'm nearly finished. I can see the end in sight'.\"\n\nShe decided to spend \u00a38,000 to have the reduction privately, but after moving from a well-paid job to universal credit, this was a tough decision.\n\nShe said: \"We need to close the door and move on - our family needs this.\"\n\n", "performance, Finland\u2019s Krista Siegfrids revealed her song Marry Me was a proposal to another woman by kissing her female backing singer.

generation\".\n\nColumnist E Jean Carroll alleges Mr Trump assaulted her in a Manhattan department store in the mid-1990s.\n\nMr Trump has consistently denied her accusation, calling it \"fiction\".\n\nA judge on Monday denied a request from Mr Trump's legal team for a mistrial.\n\nThe civil rape and defamation trial began last week in a federal court in New York City.\n\nMs Carroll took the stand for the third time on Monday, facing another round of questioning from Mr Trump's attorneys, who pressed her on why she did not report the alleged assault to the police.\n\n\"I was born in 1943,\" Ms Carroll said. \"Women like me were taught and trained to keep our chins up and to not complain.\"\n\nMs Carroll added that she was ashamed of the alleged assault and had believed it to be her fault.\n\nHer testimony came moments after a judge on Monday denied a request from Mr Trump's legal team for a mistrial.\n\nIn an 18-page letter filed filed early this week in the New York City federal court, Mr Trump's lawyer Joe Tacopina accused US District Judge Lewis Kaplan of making \"pervasive unfair and prejudicial\" rulings in the trial.\n\nHe claimed there had been \"numerous examples\" of \"unfair treatment by the Court, most of which has been witnessed by the Jury\".\n\nMr Trump is not required to testify in the trial, and his lawyers have implied he is unlikely to appear before the court.\n\nMs Carroll spent much of last week giving her account of the alleged assault and later being cross-examined by Mr Trump's lawyers.\n\nIn the request for mistrial, Mr Tacopina argued the judge had \"shut down\" his lines of questioning, including when he asked Ms Carroll why she did not seek to retrieve security camera footage from the store or scream during the alleged assault.\n\nThe request asked the judge to allow Mr Trump's lawyers more \"latitude to cross-examine [Ms Carroll] and her witnesses\".\n\nMs Carroll, 79, says the attack occurred at a Bergdorf Goodman store in late 1995 or early 1996.\n\nShe says she and Mr Trump bumped into each other while shopping and alleges he later assaulted her in one of the store's changing rooms.\n\nOn Monday, Mr Tacopina questioned why Ms Carroll continued to return to the Bergdorf Goodman store several times after the alleged assault.\n\n\"Bergdorf's is not a place I'm afraid to enter,\" she said.\n\nMr Trump, who is running in the 2024 presidential election, has repeatedly denied Ms Carroll's allegations.\n\nA former columnist for Elle magazine, Ms Carroll was able to bring the civil case against Mr Trump after New York passed the Adult Survivors Act in 2022.\n\nThe act allowed a one-year period for victims to file sexual assault lawsuits in the state over claims that would have normally exceeded

used against them.\n\nWomen's rights have been increasingly restricted since Taliban rulers returned to power in 2021.\n\nAround 50 women took part in the protest on Wednesday, according to AFP news agency.\n\nThe Taliban have given businesses one month from 2 July to close thousands of beauty salons across the country.\n\nThey said the wearing of wigs and the practice of eyebrow-plucking were against Islamic values and parents were wasting money on beauty parlours when couples get married.\n\nThe decision further restricts the spaces accessible to Afghan women, who are already barred from classrooms, gyms and parks. More recently, the Taliban also banned them from working for the United Nations.\n\nThe closure of all beauty salons will lead to the loss of 60,000 jobs, Afghanistan's chamber of commerce said.\n\nBeauty salons were last shut when the Taliban ruled between 1996 and 2001.

Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu promised a \"harsh response\" to any future incursions.\n\nDenis Kapustin is known as a Russian nationalist, and his group openly says it wants a mono-ethnic Russian state.\n\nThe RDK along with the Liberty of Russia Legion (LSR) claimed Monday's raid into Belgorod region.\n\nSpeaking on Wednesday to reporters on the Ukrainian side of the border, its leader, whose nom de guerre is White Rex, said: \"We're satisfied with the result [of the raid].\"\n\nHe said his group had managed to seize \"some weapons\", including an armoured personnel carrier, and take prisoners during the operation - before leaving Russian territory after 24 hours.\n\nHe said two RDK fighters were injured, denying claims by the Russian military about heavy casualties inflicted on the saboteurs.\n\nSeparately, the LSR said two of its fighters had been killed and 10 injured.\n\nThe casualty claims by the warring sides have not been independently verified.\n\nAt the news briefing Denis Kapustin denied reports that his fighters were using weapons provided by Western allies to Ukraine to help defend itself against Russia's full-scale invasion launched in February 2022.\n\nRussia describes the RDK and LSR as Ukrainian militants - but Kyiv says they come from two anti-Kremlin paramilitaries.\n\nBoth groups say they want to dismantle Russian President Vladimir Putin's regime, and have in the past been described as part of an international legion involved in Ukraine's territorial defence.\n\nMr Kapustin said that Ukraine only provided support to the RDK with medical supplies, petrol and food.\n\nThe RDK came to prominence in March 2023, taking part in a cross-border raid in Russia's Bryansk region which it said involved 45 people.\n\nAsked on Wednesday about reported neo-Nazis in the group's ranks, its leader responded that \"it's all a question of perception\" and went on to describe himself as having \"traditionalist\" and \"patriotic\" views.\n\nIn 2020, a Ukrainian investigative website alleged he had links to neo-Nazi groups and Mr Kapustin has spoken in the past of belonging to a movement of football h", "lot of walking to get there.\"\n\nIndia works as a commissioning coordinator at the BBC but is also a massive Swiftie\n\nFor 27-year-old India, who is the creator of the Swifties with Disabilities Network, it took two days of trying before she was able to get tickets.\n\n\"I need accessibility requirements because I have cerebral palsy, a disability from birth, so I struggle with balance,\" she says.\n\nShe also tried to get tickets through Ticketmaster, but says she wouldn't have been able to sit in the seats they were selling.\n\n\"Without the disabled options I pretty much have no options,\" she says.\n\nTicketmaster are selling accessibility tickets for the shows in Edinburgh and Cardiff.\n\nIndia says she's disappointed disabled fans have had to buy tickets over the phone for Wembley.\n\n\"I just feel really disheartened because I'm lucky enough to have had a connection with Taylor Swift over the years.\n\n\"She's been really generous to me as a person.

In the Cerrado, which is the centre of agricultural production, there was a 6% increase in tree loss.\n\nWildfires ranged in Canada throughout 2023, pushing up global tree losses\n\nColombia also saw a significant decline with primary forest loss down by almost half compared to 2022.\n\nObservers say the actions of President Gustavo Petro Urrego have played an important role in the fall.\n\n\"The story of deforestation in Colombia is complex and deeply intertwined with the country's politics, which makes 2023's historic decrease particularly powerful,\" said Alejandra Laina, from WRI, Colombia.\n\n\"There is no doubt that recent government action and the commitment of the communities has had a profound impact on Colombia's forests, and we encourage those involved in current peace talks to use this data as a springboard to accelerate further progress.\"\n\nBut elsewhere the picture on tree loss remains poor.\n\nBolivia saw a record loss for the third year in a row with numbers up 27% on 2022. Around half of this was down to fires, as hot weather saw fires started by humans spread into forests.\n\nThere were also notable upticks in Laos and Nicaragua, mainly due to agricultural expansion.\n\nA worker harvesting Brazil nuts in Bolivia where the expansion of agriculture and wildfire has seen tree losses rise rapidly\n\nIndonesia also saw an increase in losses, but the rate remains historically low compared to a decade ago.\n\nResearchers say the overall picture is decidedly mixed, and they point to the fact that the world has just six years left to keep a promise to halt deforestation, made in 2021 at COP26 in Glasgow.\n\n\"This report appropriately challenges us to balance despair and hope at the same time,\" said Dr. Andrew Steer, president and CEO of the Bezos Earth Fund.\n\n\"The alarmingly high rates of global deforestation remind us how badly off track we are in solving the climate and nature crises.\"\n\nFox chairman Rupert Murdoch (left, with son Lachlan) could have had to testify\n\nFox News has settled a defamation lawsuit from the voting machine company, Dominion, over its reporting of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nIn a last-minute settlement before trial, the network agreed to pay $787.5m (\u00a3634m) - about half of the $1.6bn initially sought by Dominion.\n\nDominion argued its business was harmed by Fox spreading false claims the vote had been rigged against Donald Trump.\n\nThe deal spares Fox executives such as Rupert Murdoch from having to testify.\n\nThe judge in the case is not required to give his approval for the agreement.\n\nFox said Tuesday's settlement in one of the most anticipated defamation trials in recent US history reflected its \"commitment to the highest journalistic standards\".\n\nThe Fox statement added without elaborating that the network \"acknowledges the court's rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false\".\n\nDominion chief executive John Poulos told a press conference the deal included Fox \"admitting to telling lies, causing enormous damage to my company\".\n\n\"Lies have consequences,\" he added. \"Over two years ago a torrent of lies swept Dominion and election officials across America into an alternative universe of conspiracy theories, causing grievous harm to Dominion and the country.\"\n\nMr Nelson added that for \"democracy to endure\", Americans must \"share a commitment to facts\".\n\nOpening arguments in the case had been due to start on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe announcement of a settlement came after an unexplained delay of several hours once jury selection had finished, prompting speculation that talks were under way behind the scenes.\n\nOn Monday, Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis announced that the start of the trial would be delayed by 24 hours.\n\nAlthough he gave no reason, US media reported that it was to give both sides an opportunity to reach a settlement.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, however, both sides appeared to be digging in for a lengthy trial.\n\nAttorneys for Fox had repeatedly objected to the $1.6bn in damages sought by Colorado-based Dominion, characterising the figure as massively inflated.\n\nThe \"real cost\" of the case, Fox had argued, would be the \"cherished\" rights to freedom of speech and of the press enshrined in the First Amendment of the US Constitution.\n\n", "played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

This is their crew, this is our crew, this is humanity's crew,\" said Nasa Administrator Bill Nelson.\n\n\"Nasa astronauts Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, and Christina Hammock Koch, and CSA astronaut Jeremy Hansen, each has their own story, but, together, they represent our creed: E pluribus unum - out of many, one. Together, we are ushering in a new era of exploration for a new generation of star sailors and dreamers - the Artemis Generation.\"\n\nNasa's Orion capsule had an unpiloted outing last year\n\nWiseman will be the commander; Glover will be his pilot; Koch and Hansen will act as the supporting \"mission specialists\".\n\nThe quartet are essentially repeating the 1968 mission carried out by Apollo 8, which was the first human spaceflight to reach the Moon.\n\nIts crew took the famous \"Earthrise\" picture that showed our home planet emerging from behind the lunar horizon.\n\nVictor Glover - a naval aviator - will be the Artemis-2 pilot\n\nThe major difference this time will be the use of the 21st Century technology that Nasa has developed under its Artemis programme. In Greek mythology, Artemis was the twin sister of Apollo.\n\nLast year, the agency tested its next-generation Moon rocket, called the Space Launch System, and its associated crew capsule, known as Orion.\n\nThis Artemis-1 mission left Earth on a 25-day excursion around the Moon without anyone on board. This allowed engineers to assess the readiness of the hardware.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: Nasa Artemis-1 mission blasts off from the Kennedy Space Center\n\nNow, the newly named astronauts will climb into Orion for Artemis-2 and a journey to and from the Moon that's likely to take about 10 days.\n\nThe last human spaceflight mission to the Moon was Apollo 17 in December 1972. The first landing was Apollo 11 in 1969.\n\nArtemis-3, the first landing of the new era, is not expected to occur until at least 12 months after Artemis-2.\n\nNasa doesn't yet have a system capable of taking astronauts down to the lunar surface. This is being developed by entrepreneur Elon Musk's SpaceX company.\n\nIt will be a variant of his Starship vehicle, which is due to start flight testing in the next few weeks.\n\nNasa Administrator Bill Nelson (far right) introduced the chosen quartet\n\n\"We need to celebrate this moment in human history because Artemis-2 is more than a mission to the Moon and back; it's more than a mission that has to happen before we send people to the surface of the Moon. It is the next step on the journey that gets humanity to Mars,\" Victor Glover told the Houston ceremony.\n\nChristina Koch added: \"Are you excited? I asked that because the one thing I'm most excited about is that we are going to carry your excitement, your aspirations, your dreams with us, on this mission, Artemis-2 - your mission.\"\n\nVanessa Wyche is the director of Nasa's Johnson Space Flight Center, the home of mission control. She said:\n\n\"Among the [Artemis-2] crew are the first woman, first person of colour, and first Canadian on a lunar mission, and all four astronauts will represent the best of humanity as they explore for the benefit of all.\"\n\nThales will manufacture optronic masts for the new Dreadnought submarine class\n\nA \u00a3169m contract for the UK nuclear deterrent programme will support more than 150 jobs in Scotland.\n\nThe order will see Thales Glasgow continue a 100-year tradition of making periscopes for Royal Navy submarines.\n\nThe site in Govan will build the integrated optronic combat system mast, the above water \"eyes\", for the future nuclear deterrent class Dreadnought.\n\nEvery Royal Navy submarine since 1917 has carried a Thales periscope or optronics mast made on the Clyde.\n\nThe Dreadnought version continues the tradition and the wider programme, from design through to build, will sustain around 30,000 jobs across the UK.\n\nThe work will guarantee 150 jobs at Thales Glasgow\n\nThe deal was announced as Scottish Secretary Alister Jack prepared to chair a working group of Scottish defence companies, armed forces and and trade body ADS, in a bid to \"turbocharge\" Scotland's defence sector.\n\nMr Jack said Scottish \"skills, expertise and innovation\" made a massive contribution to the UK's defence industry.\n\nHe added: \"With more than a century's experience of building periscopes and optronic masts for our submarines, it's great news that Thales' Glasgow workforce will once again be at the forefront of producing the state-of-the-art combat system mast for our round the clock nuclear deterrent.\n\n\"Defence plays a crucial part in the security of the United Kingdom and also contributes significantly to delivering high-skilled jobs and investment in Scotland.\"\n\nThales will fulfil the contract for BAE Systems Submarines.\n\nIt is already on contract to build the ultra-powerful Sonar 2076 system for the Dreadnought class which now means it will be providing the boat's \"eyes and ears\" behind the platform's operational capability.\n\nAlex Cresswell, CEO of Thales in the UK, said: \"We are extremely proud to say that our combat system mast and sonar will be providing the eyes and ears capabilities of the new Dreadnought Class.\n\n\"The boat build, led by BAE Systems and partners, will be another milestone showcase of UK engineering skills and innovation.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

It also followed basketball star Dennis Rodman and the Harlem Globetrotters team on a \"sports diplomacy\" trip to North Korea.\n\nMore recent fare has included documentaries about controversial influencer Andrew Tate and a film about Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, by actor Sean Penn.\n\nVice Media Group's investors include Fortress Investment Group, Monroe Capital and Soros Fund Management - the firm founded by fund manager and billionaire George Soros.\n\nThe hope was that Vice would reap the financial rewards from attracting millions of younger readers through social media networks such as Facebook and Instagram.\n\nHowever, the company's revenues have been flat for some years and it has also struggled to turn a profit. Vice's plans to go public through a merger also failed.\n\n\"The issue with Vice and all similar websites is that they never really worked out a business model for free online journalism,\" Joseph Teasdale, head of technology at Enders Analysis, told the BBC.\n\nWebsites like Vice came along at the same time as the first dotcom boom was in its infancy and technology start-ups were springing up.\n\n\"There was a tendency at the time to treat everything like software, where you do your investment up front, attract a bunch of users, and then eventually when you're big enough you become incredibly profitable,\" he said.\n\n\"But it turns out content doesn't work like that - if you want people to keep coming back to your website, or to reach new people in new markets, you have to keep spending to make new content.\"\n\nAnd some of Vice's content was \"pretty expensive journalism\", Mr Teasdale said, involving global trips.\n\nLast month, Vice announced layoffs after its flagship TV programme was shut down.\n\nBuzzFeed, another pioneering online platform, also recently announced that it was shutting down its news division and laying off 15% of its workforce amid serious financial challenges and a slump in advertising revenue.\n\nVice Media has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, a procedure which postpones a US company's obligations to its creditors, giving it time to reorganise its debts or sell parts of the business.\n\nAnnouncing the bankruptcy move, Bruce Dixon and Hozefa Lokhandwala, Vice's co-chief executive officers, said: \"This accelerated court-supervised sale process will strengthen the company and position Vice for long-term growth.\"\n\nVice's lenders have approved $20m of funding to keep the firm going through the bankruptcy process. During this time, other firms can submit \"higher or better\" bids for the media company.\n\nIf these offers are not successful, Vice Media's lenders will acquire the publisher for $225m.\n\nThe sale process is expected to take about two to three months.\n\nWilliam J Burns said the failure of the Ukraine war risked undermining Vladimir Putin's leadership of Russia\n\nThe Ukraine war is having a \"corrosive\" effect on Vladimir Putin's leadership of Russia, according to the head of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).\n\nRussian disaffection over the war is providing new opportunities for the CIA to collect intelligence, the agency's Director William J Burns said.\n\nAmerica's top spy made the comments while delivering the annual lecture at the Ditchley Foundation in the UK.\n\nHe was speaking a week after the mutiny by Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin.\n\nMr Burns said everyone had been \"riveted\" by the scenes last Saturday of Prigozhin's \"armed challenge\" to Moscow, when his Wagner mercenary forces marched towards Russia's capital.\n\nPrigozhin's actions were \"a vivid reminder of the corrosive effect of Putin's war on his own society and his own regime\", he said.\n\nThe CIA director said the impact not just of Prigozhin's actions but also his statements - which included an indictment of both the rationale and execution of Russia's invasion - would play out for some time.\n\n\"Disaffection with the war will continue to gnaw away at the Russian leadership,\" Mr Burns said in his prepared remarks.\n\n\"That disaffection creates a once in a generation opportunity for us at CIA,\" referring to the role of the agency in recruiting human agents to provide intelligence.\n\n\"We are not letting it go to waste,\" he said to laughter from the audience. \"We are very much open for business.\"\n\nThe CIA has recently launched a new social media campaign to try and reach people in Russia, including a video posted to the Telegram social media site, which is widely used by Russians. The campaign provided instructions on how to contact the CIA on the dark web without being monitored.\n\nThis video gained 2.5 million views in the first week.\n\nDirector Burns also reiterated the message other US officials have previously made in public that the US had no part in Prigozhin's mutiny.\n\nHe did not directly address recent reports in the Washington Post that he made a secret visit to the Ukrainian capital before the mutiny.\n\nIt was reported that discussions included the possibility that progress in Ukraine's counter-offensive might open the way for negotiations from a position of greater strength if substantial territory was taken.\n\nMr Burns - who previously served as the US Ambassador to Russia from 2005 to 2008 - said spending much of the last two decades trying to understand Russian President Putin had given him a \"healthy dose of humility about pontificating about Putin and Russia\".\n\nBut he added that one thing that he had learnt was that it was always a mistake to underestimate Mr Putin's fixation on controlling Ukraine.\n\nThe Russian leader believed that without Ukraine, Russia could not be a major power and Mr Putin himself could not be a great leader, he said.\n\n\"That tragic and brutish fixation has already brought shame to Russia and exposed its weaknesses,\" Mr Burns said.\n\n\"Putin's war has already been a strategic failure for Russia: its military weaknesses laid bare, its economy badly damaged for years to come, its future as a junior partner and economic colony of China being shaped by Putin's mistakes.\"\n\nTurning to China, the CIA boss said it would be foolish for the US to attempt to decouple because of the deep economic interdependence between the two countries.\n\n\"China is the only country with both the intent to reshape the international order and increasingly the economic, diplomatic, military and technological power to do so,\" he said.\n\nThe US should instead \"sensibly de-risk and diversify by securing resilient supply chains, protecting our technological edge and investing in industrial capacity\", he added.\n\nThe search warrant was granted a week after Mr Yousaf succeeded Nicola Sturgeon as SNP leader\n\nScotland's first minister has said there was nothing unusual in the timing of a warrant to search his predecessor's home.\n\nIt emerged on Tuesday that police", "ound embarrassment that only after what regretfully happened did I learn of the antiquity of the monument.\"\n\nHe said that he praised those who \"guard the inestimable historical and artistic value of the Colosseum with dedication, care and sacrifice\".\n\nHe added: \"I am also aware of the fact that a similar conduct, in my country, would result in far more serious consequences.\n\n\"For this reason I assume all responsibility and I will sincerely and concretely commit myself to redeem and remedy the mistake I made.\n\n\"The incivility, superficiality and thoughtlessness with which I acted, damaging the Colosseum to the detriment of anyone who legitimately wishes to admire and enjoy it, have no justification.\"\n\nThe lawyer for Mr Dimitrov, Alexandro Maria Tirelli, told the BBC: \"We have already formulated a plea bargain request.\n\n\"The boy will certainly benefit from a suspended sentence, the fact is heinous but not serious.\"\n\nThe 27-year-old man was filmed by another visitor who verbally reprimanded him before handing the recording to security officials.\n\nA video of the scene was uploaded on to YouTube and shared across social media.\n\nIf convicted of an offence, he could face a fine of up to 15,000 euros (\u00a312,500) as well as a prison sentence of between two and five years.\n\nMr Dimitrov's lawyer told Il Messaggero newspaper that it is hoped the letter will help his client avoid the harshest sentence.\n\nThe Colosseum is one of the best-known symbols of Imperial Rome, and Italy's most popular tourist site.\n\nIt is a protected Unesco World Heritage Site, meaning it is considered to be a place of \"outstanding universal value\".\n\nThe incident prompted widespread condemnation in Italy and across the globe.\n\nItalian Culture Minister Gennaro Sangiuliano said it \"was offensive to everyone around the world who appreciates the value of archaeology, monuments and history\".\n\nAnti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller was told a bank account for her political party would close without explanation.\n\nMonzo initially refused to tell Ms Miller why her \"True and Fair\" party account would be closed in September.\n\nAfter the BBC contacted the bank about the case, it said it did not allow political party accounts and had made a mistake in allowing it to be opened.\n\nMonzo said it recognised the experience would have been \"frustrating for the customer and we're sorry for that\".\n\nMs Miller is a businesswoman who came to public attention after twice leading successful attempts to challenge the government's handling of Brexit. In 2019, the Supreme Court ruled in her favour, finding that Boris Johnson had unlawfully suspended Parliament.\n\nQuestions over so-called \"debanking\" have increased in recent weeks following the well-publicised case of former Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage.\n\nMr Farage obtained documents which revealed that his political views had been discussed by Coutts bank in their decision to close his account.\n\nThe fallout from the row has led to both the boss of NatWest, which owns Coutts, and the chief executive of Coutts stepping down from their positions.\n\nMs Miller said a number of banks had turned down an application for her political party to open a bank account.\n\nShe did successfully open an account with Monzo in November 2021.\n\nHowever, earlier this month, Ms Miller received an email from the bank which read: \"Unfortunately we can't tell you why we're closing your account.\n\n\"We can't share the specific reason for closing your account. As a bank we regularly review and sometimes close accounts as part of our legal and regulatory responsibilities.\"\n\nAfter the BBC contacted Monzo about the case - with Ms Miller's permission - the bank did provide an explanation.\n\nA spokeswoman for the bank said: \"Like lots of banks, we do not accept any political parties as Monzo Business customers in the same way that we don't currently accept trusts, clubs and a range of other organisations.\n\n\"In this case, the account wasn't originally categorised as a political party.\n\n\"After this was identified and corrected, the customer was given notice that the account would be closed. We recognise that this experience will have been frustrating for the customer and we're sorry for that.\"\n\nMs Miller said the difficulty in accessing banking facilities was a problem.\n\n\"The government has to step in,\" she told the BBC. \"We do not have a functioning democracy if you cannot access a bank account.\"\n\nDespite their differences over Brexit, Mr Farage tweeted his support, saying: \"This is just plain wrong at every level. I stand with @thatginamiller.\"\n\nFormer cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg, another prominent Brexiteer, said Ms Miller's case showed \"there is something rotten in the state of British banking\".\n\nThe government has been critical of NatWest after Mr Farage lost his bank account and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said nobody should lose their bank account because of legally held political views.\n\nThere is no suggestion Ms Miller's political views were involved in this case - but she has sought more information from the bank.\n\nThe closure of Mr Farage's account has triggered a wider debate about banking\n\nOther politicians and campaigners have also struggled to open bank accounts - in July, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt told the Financial Times he believed he had been blocked from opening an account because of his public role.\n\nThe government is planning reforms which would mean banks have to give people three months' notice of bank account closures - and a full explanation of the reasons.\n\nMinisters are also looking into the enforcement of rules around Politically Exposed Persons - a financial category which means political figures face more stringent checks.\n\nSomeone classed as a PEP is seen to present a higher risk for financial institutions as they are deemed to be more exposed to potential involvement in bribery and corruption.\n\nCity minister Andrew Griffith said earlier this week in a letter: \"The government is clear that domestic PEPs should be treated in a manner which is in line with their risk, and that banks should not be closing individuals' accounts solely due to their status as a PEP.\"\n\nA cleaner destroyed decades of \"groundbreaking\" work by shutting off a lab freezer containing key samples over an \"annoying\" alarm sound, US lawyers have claimed.\n\nA sign explained how to mute the beep, but a breaker was reportedly switched off after a reading error.\n\nSamples stored at -80C (-112F) were left \"unsalvageable\", causing $1m in damages, lawyers said.\n\nThe lab's school is suing the cleaner's employer for improper training.\n\nThe company held a $1.4m (\u00a31.1m) contract to clean the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York back in 2020 which is when the alleged incident happened, paper Times Union reported.\n\nResearch on photosynthesis, headed by Prof KV Lakshmi, had the potential to be \"ground-breaking\" in furthering solar panel development, a lawyer for the institute wrote.\n\nA few days before the freezer was turned off, an alarm went off to alert a 3C temperature rise. Though the fluctuation could have been catastrophic, Prof Lakshmi \"determined that the cell cultures, samples and research were not being harmed,\" the legal case read.\n\nDue to Covid restrictions at the time, it would take a week before any repairs could begin.\n\nIn the meantime, a sign on the freezer's door read: \"This freezer is beeping as it is under repair. Please do not move or unplug it. No cleaning required in this area.\n\n\"You can press the alarm/test mute button for 5-10 seconds if you would like to mute the sound.\"\n\nBut days after the alarm started sounding, the cleaner turned off the circuit breaker providing electricity to the freezer.\n\nThe majority of specimens that were meant to be kept at -80C were \"compromised, destroyed and rendered unsalvageable, demolishing more than 20 years of research\", according to the legal case.\n\nA report filed by public safety staff at the institute said the cleaner thought they were flipping the breaker on when they actually turned it off, the New York Post reported.\n\nThe temperature had allegedly risen by 50 degrees to about -30C by the time researchers discovered the error.\n\nLawyer Michael Ginsberg told NBC News that the cleaning employee heard \"annoying alar", "flexible\", \"hybrid\" or \"remote\" working.\n\nThe chancellor's comments came after the boss the BCC warned UK business needed a \"fresh relationship\" with the government\n\nShevaun Haviland, director-general of the major business lobby group, said it was a \"pivotal moment for the voice of British business\" with an election looming in 18 months' time.\n\nOpening the BCC's annual conference Ms Haviland said companies had been hit by \"eye-watering\" energy bills, rising interest rates and a \"cripplingly tight labour market\".\n\nThrough its regional branches, the British Chambers of Commerce claims to represent tens of thousands of UK businesses employing almost six million people. It hosts networking events, shares best practice and lobbies government for pro-business policies.\n\nShould the office be the default location for workers? Get in touch:\n\nIts warning that British business needs a new relationship with government comes after contact between ministers and the country's largest lobby group, the CBI, was suspended following allegations of sexual misconduct at the organisation, which has since lost members.\n\nFollowing Ms Haviland's speech, Mr Hunt defended his handling of the economy, and said there was \"nothing automatic\" about controlling inflation, which is the rate prices rise at.\n\nHe said independent forecasters believed the government was on track to meet its pledge to halve the annual rate of inflation this year. It is currently at 10.1%.\n\nHowever, some economists have previously said that inflation is due to fall naturally as energy and commodity prices ease, rather than due to specific government policies.\n\nSpeaking at the conference, Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, said there were \"good reasons to expect inflation to fall sharply over the coming months\", starting with figures for April which are due to be released next week.\n\nBut he said the UK was experiencing \"second-round\" effects of inflation, highlighting that price setting by companies and wage rises were fuelling inflation in part.\n\n\"And as headline inflation falls, these second-round effects are unlikely to go away as quickly as they appeared,\" he said.\n\nThe Bank is responsible for setting interest rates and keeping inflation at around 2%.\n\nLast week, the Bank warned soaring food costs would mean prices will remain higher for longer, as it raised interest rates for the 12th time in a row. to 4.5% in the battle to slow inflation.\n\nBy raising rates, the Bank expects people to have less money to spend and buy fewer things, which should help stop prices rising as quickly.\n\nHowever, it also makes it harder for firms to borrow money and expand.\n\nGlasgow City Council is having to hire vehicles because some of its own fleet does not meet new rules on emissions.\n\nMore than 600 of its vehicles are not allowed inside the city's Low Emission Zone (LEZ) introduced last week.\n\nThe council said only a small number of the non-compliant vehicles were required to enter the zone but they include all its uplift trucks used for parking enforcement.\n\nThe GMB union said the cost of hiring vehicles was a waste of resources.\n\nOf the 1,615 vehicles owned by Glasgow City council, 616 are non-compliant meaning they are no longer allowed inside the council's new LEZ.\n\nA spokeswoman for Glasgow City Council told the BBC: \"New LEZ compliant vehicles are expected to be delivered to us in the near future and we are also retrofitting existing vehicles to improve emissions standards across our fleet.\n\n\"LEZ compliant vehicles have been hired in the short term to ensure emissions standards are met and this will allow older vehicles to be taken out of service in line with our ongoing fleet replacement programme.\"\n\nThe spokesperson added the LEZ was crucial to improving air quality in the city centre.\n\nThe council's fleet includes a variety of cars, buses, lorries and vans used by to carry out various aspects of council business.\n\nAmong the non-complaint vehicles is a limousine used to by the council's Lord Provost, according to the Scottish Daily Express.\n\nThe LEZ covers an area from the M8 motorway to the north and west of Glasgow, the River Clyde to the south, and the Saltmarket/High Street to the east.\n\nThe restrictions were introduced last week but similar restrictions have been in place for buses and heavy good vehicles since 2018.\n\nSpeaking on BBC Scotland's Drivetime, Chris Mitchell from the GMB union said the council \"should have thought of this a long time ago\".\n\nMr Mitchell, who works as a refuse collector for the council said: \"The majority of the vehicles I deal with are non-complaint for the LEZ because they are the best part of 15 years old and obviously we still need to provide a service within the city centre.\n\n\"Unfortunately they've had to hire in a number of vehicles at a pretty penny, at a cost to the council - well, at a cost to the taxpayer.\"\n\nMr Mitchell said the types of vehicles being hired were \"small flat-bed\" vehicles, used for collecting rubbish.\n\nThe Glasgow City Council spokeswoman said no new bin lorries had been hired to meet LEZ requirements although some lorries were hired under a pre-existing arrangement.\n\nShe was unable to provide a figure at this time for the cost of hiring replacement vehicles.\n\nAustralia will fast track plans to acquire the US HIMARS system.\n\nAustralia will speed up efforts to buy longer range missiles to counter the growing threat from China, a major defence review says.\n\nIt warns the country can no longer be protected by its geographic isolation in the \"missile age\".\n\nThe government will spend some A$19bn ($12bn, \u00a310bn) to deliver the report's immediate recommendations.\n\nThe 110-page study is described as the biggest overhaul of Australian defence since World War Two.\n\nThe Defence Strategic Review (DSR) comes amid increasing regional tension over China's stance towards Taiwan, which it has repeatedly vowed to take by force if necessary.\n\nThe Chinese navy has also established a major presence in the South China Sea, claiming parts of it as its own territory, contrary to international law.\n\n\"China's military build-up is now the largest and most ambitious of any country since the end of the Second World War. This build up is occurring without transparency or reassurance to the Indo-Pacific region of China's strategic intent,\" the report states.\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese said the review would \"shape the future rather than waiting for the future to shape us\", and its recommendations would make Australia \"more self-reliant, more prepared and more secure\".\n\nIt recommends that Australia's armed forces switch focus from land-based armour to \"longer-range strike capability, with munitions built in Australia\", Defence Minister Richard Marles said.\n\n\"We need to have a defence force which has the capacity to engage in 'impactful projection',\" Mr Marles told reporters.\n\nThe minister said the acquisition of \"precision strike missiles\" with ranges in excess of 500km (310 miles) would give the army \"the firepower and mobility it needs into the future\".\n\nA 2022 think tank report warned of a \"worst-case scenario\" for Australia's military where China took control of territory in the near region during a possible war over Taiwan.\n\nAnd Australia's new defence posture was aimed at keeping \"a major power adversary like China... as far away as possible\", said Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) analyst Dr Malcolm Davis.\n\n\"What we're trying to do is to deter China from using force to achieve its policy objectives, including Taiwan or in the South China Sea. So it is about deterrence. But of course, deterrence can fail, as we saw with Ukraine, so you then have to be ready to respond. What we're investing in will dramatically extend our combat reach,\" he said.\n\nBut he added that while the review was a \"step in the right direction\", it was not a complete solution.\n\n\"We're going down the path of a focused force, designed for impactful projection, that is better suited to the sort of threat that we're facing in this decade and beyond, rather than [one] which tries to do everything. But I think more needs to be done. We need to spend more on defence... and we need to invest in getting [forces] much more rapidly into the field.\"\n\nThe strategic review recommends strengthening Australia's northern defences and giving the ADF greater operating ability from northern bases", "Twitter.

Rishi Sunak sits alongside US First Lady Jill Biden at the Downing Street lunch\n\nIn Windsor, the Prince and Princess of Wales, William and Catherine, chatted and shook hands with people picnicking along The Long Walk which leads to Windsor Castle. Many will be gearing up for Sunday night's Coronation Concert.\n\nThe lunchtime crowds shouted \"hip hip hooray\" as the royals sipped a homemade gin cocktail, christened Purple Reign, from union jack paper cups while talking to a group of women in foam crowns.\n\nCatherine, dressed in a pale blue blazer, smiled for a selfie with one woman and crouched down to console a tearful little girl who was overwhelmed by the occasion.\n\nSpeaking to another wellwisher, William revealed that his eldest son Prince George - one of the King's pages of honour at the Coronation - is a fan of classic rock music.\n\nCaroline Mulvihill, from the Rock Choir in Windsor and Maidenhead, said: \"Will was telling us in their household they have a very diverse music taste and George is very much into AC/DC and Led Zeppelin.\"\n\nAnother choir member, Sam Leckenby, said the royal couple had revealed they were \"quite pleased\" Saturday's ceremony had been shortened and was not the traditional five hours long.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh joined a Coronation Big Lunch in Cranleigh, Surrey, while the Princess Royal and her husband Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence were at a community street party in Swindon.\n\nThe Duke of York's daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, were attending a lunch in Chalfont St Giles, Buckinghamshire.\n\nAt Downing Street, the prime minister and his wife hosted their own lunch for community figures, Ukrainian families, youth groups - and US First Lady Jill Biden, who represented President Biden at Saturday's Coronation ceremony.\n\nIn all, some 50,000 Coronation lunches are expected to take place in the UK and across the world.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh mingled with crowds in Cranleigh, Surrey\n\nThe King and Queen said they hoped the events would be \"truly enjoyable\", in a message posted on the Royal Family's official Instagram account.\n\nLater at 20:00 BST, the Coronation Concert takes place at Windsor Castle and will be broadcast live on BBC One and BBC Radio 2.\n\nBig names include Katy Perry and Lionel Richie, who were at Saturday's Coronation, as well as Take That, Olly Murs and Paloma Faith.\n\nThere will also be musical favourites from a world-class orchestra and a joint performance from The Royal Ballet, The Royal Opera House, the Royal Shakespeare Company, The Royal College of Music and The Royal College of Art.\n\nThis video can not", "Sullivan\n\u2022 None 'Moments Moyes and West Ham will never forget'\n\u2022 None Our coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before -

she was able to rearrange everything and actually live in her home again.\n\n\"That was the start of it - the signal we needed, to go, 'right, OK, we're on to something here'.\"\n\nThe window design uses polyethylene, PVC piping, pipe insulation and duct tape, to create four layers of insulation.\n\nIt costs around \u00a312 per square metre of window, and can be built at home in 15 minutes.\n\nInsulate Ukraine teams are showing local communities how to instruct and fit the windows\n\nThe project aims to create hubs across the country that can replace any shattered window within 24 hours, with the work largely being carried out by local people.\n\nFedor Tikva, 64, of Izyum, eastern Ukraine, told the PA news agency it had been impossible to live in his home after it was damaged by nearby bombing.\n\n\"All windows there were broken, even the frames were partly damaged,\" he said.\n\n\"I am happy now because after the installation of all the windows the house became more cosy, warmer and lighter.\n\n\"Before the installation... it was too dark and cold inside.\"\n\nThe plastic windows can be ready in as little as 15 minutes\n\nMr Blakiston Houston said: \"Part of Putin's war is about trying to make people in Ukraine cold and miserable.\n\n\"It's about breaking their resolve to actually continue defending themselves.\n\n\"We're essentially empowering Ukrainians because we're giving them a way to solve this problem for themselves.\n\n\"All we have to do is show them how to build the windows and help them to get hold of the materials.\"\n\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

The child was crying and was offered an ice pack.\n\nBut when she was taken to University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, an X-ray revealed she had broken her leg and spent nine months in a plaster cast. The accident was again not reported by the company.\n\nMultiple broken legs at Supajump in Cardiff went unreported\n\nAnother child, aged 11, broke her leg after landing on something hard in the foam pit in April 2018.\n\nMr Harrison said when the parents filled out a form explaining what had happened, they were told by a staff member to take out any reference to her hitting something hard, claiming it was not possible, and the incident was not reported by Supajump.\n\nIn April 2019, a nine-year-old girl broke her thigh bone in the foam pit, and in August that year another girl, also nine, fractured her spine in the same area of the trampoline park. Neither incident was reported.\n\nFinally, the court heard a three-year-old boy broke his leg in August 2019 after an older boy jumped on his trampoline.\n\nThe double jump resulted in him landing awkwardly. An X-ray at the Royal Gwent Hospital revealed breaks in both lower leg bones in one leg, but the accident was not reported by the attraction owners.\n\nRepresenting Booth, John Ryan said: \"There are failures for which he is truly remorseful.\"\n\nAddressing Booth, Judge Matthew Porter Bryant that problems \"soon became evident\" at the park after it opened in April 2017 and that \"basic principles\" of safety were absent.\n\nHe said: \"Premises like yours should remove risk and give children a chance to have fun in a safe place.\n\n\"People put their trust in you", "ishi Sunak and has hit out at those who sought to oust Mr Johnson.\n\nAnnouncing that she would not stand in the general election in February, she criticised \"the lack of cohesion, the infighting and occasionally the sheer stupidity from those who think we could remove a sitting prime minister\".\n\n\"I'm afraid it's this behaviour that I now just have to remove myself from,\" she added.\n\nBaroness McDonagh played a major role behind the scenes during Labour's success in the late 90s and early 2000s\n\nBaroness Margaret McDonagh, the first female general secretary of the Labour Party, has died aged 61.\n\nShe was a key figure in the party under Sir Tony Blair's leadership, and played a central role in both the 1997 and 2001 general election victories.\n\nShe was diagnosed with brain cancer in 2021.\n\nSenior Labour figures have paid tribute, including Sir Keir Starmer, who said she was \"absolutely essential\" in returning the party to power.\n\nHe called her a \"tireless champion for women\" who \"may not have been as famous as some of the politicians she worked with but they wouldn't have got into power without her\".\n\nAs part of Tony Blair's inner circle during the New Labour era, she helped lead the party back into government and became its general secretary in 1998, playing a key role behind the scenes.\n\nSir Tony called her the \"most loyal friend anyone could wish for\" and said she was a \"vital element\" during Labour's success in the late 90s and early 2000s.\n\nShe went on to run the successful 2001 election campaign and was made a life peer in 2004.\n\nLord Mandelson, who was the party's campaign director during the1997 election, said she was a \"tour de force\" who ran Labour's headquarters \"with a rod of iron\".\n\nHe continued: \"Everyone was terrified, including me. I have never met anyone so resolute, so uncompromisingly honest and so direct.\"\n\nFormer Labour leader Neil Kinnock said she was \"magnificent in every way\" and had shown courage in fighting her illness.\n\nHe added: \"She strove in the most practical ways for true equality for women throughout her life, she was a brilliant organizer for democracy and she had mixture of steel and charm which earned her loyalty from friends and admiration from foes.\"\n\nIn March, her sister Siobhain McDonagh, the Labour MP for Mitcham and Morden, accused the NHS of abandoning people with glioblastoma, the brain condition Margaret was diagnosed with.\n\nIn an emotional Commons speech, she was critical of the lack of progress in how the cancer is treated, saying: \"There is no hope, no future, no trials, nothing.\"\n\nClimate change protests have disrupted Humza Yousaf's first session of first minister's questions in the Scottish Parliament.\n\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross was interrupted repeatedly, forcing FMQs into several suspensions.\n\nEventually Presiding Officer Alison Johnstone took the decision to clear a large part of the public gallery.\n\nHospital bosses in England say they cannot guarantee patient safety during next week's four-day strike by junior doctors.\n\nLondon's Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Trust conceded patients could be harmed as managers struggle to staff rotas.\n\nOther hospital bosses also voiced concerns over the walkout, which will affect both emergency and planned care.\n\nThe British Medical Association has refused to exempt any services but says it has plans to protect patients.\n\nIt contrasts with the approach of the Royal College of Nursing and ambulance unions, which excluded key emergency services from strike action.\n\nInstead, the BMA has said it will meet trade union requirements for life-and-limb cover to be provided by considering pulling junior doctors off the picket line if individual hospitals report lives are in immediate danger during the actual strike, which runs from 07:00 BST on Tuesday to 07:00 BST on Saturday.\n\nThe BMA is after a 35% pay rise to make up for 15 years of below-inflation wage rises, but the government has called the claim unrealistic.\n\nDuring last month's junior doctors' strike, hospitals were able to draft in consultants to provide cover, but with an estimated quarter of them on leave next week - the four-day walkout is immediately after the Easter weekend - NHS bosses are warning this time they fear the worst.\n\nDr Sara Hanna, who is part of the senior management team at Guy's and St Thomas', said: \"I am really worried about next week. I am particularly worried about ability to staff our rotas. I am hopeful we will have enough doctors but can't say for sure.\n\n\"It is impossible to say there won't be harm to patients. Junior doctors are an incredibly important part of the workforce.\"\n\nJunior doctors represent more than 40% of the medical workforce and include those fresh out of university through to experienced medics with more than 10 years of experience. Around two-thirds are BMA members.\n\nDr Hanna, who is interim head of the trust's Evelina London Children's Hospital, said up to half of all planned treatments could be cancelled as the trust redeployed its senior doctors - and this is on top of the impact of postponements during previous walkouts.\n\nShe said the cumulative impact of this was particularly problematic for children who are growing and developing.\n\nNHS Providers, which represents health managers, said such concerns were widespread.\n\nChief executive Sir Julian Hartley said: \"It's clear from our extensive dialogue with trust leaders that we are in uncharted territory.\n\n\"We need a solution to prevent further strikes and we need it now.\"\n\nThe organisation also released a series of statements provided by hospital chief executives.\n\nOne warned: \"This is less about what planned routine work gets pulled down and everything about maintenance of safety in emergency departments, acute medicine and surgery. Concerned doesn't begin to describe it.\"\n\nAnother said: \"I am not confident this time that we can maintain patient safety, as we will not be able to provide the cover.\"\n\nHow are your local NHS services coping this winter? Data for England is shown by NHS trust, where the trust includes at least one hospital with a Type 1 A&E department. Type 1 means a consultant-led 24 hour A&E service with full resuscitation facilities. Data for Wales and Scotland is shown by Health Board and in Northern Ireland by Health and Social Care Trust. When you enter a postcode for a location in England you will be shown a list of NHS trusts in your area. They will not necessarily be in order of your closest hospital as some trusts have more than one hospital. Data for Wales and Scotland are shown by NHS board and by Health and Social Care trust in Northern Ireland. Comparative data is shown for a previous year where available. However, where trusts have merged there is no like-for-like comparison to show. Earlier data is not available for all measures, so comparisons between years are not always possible. A&E attendances include all emergency departments in that trust or health board, not just major A&E departments, for example, those who attend minor injury units. Each nation has different target times for some of the measures shown, therefore comparisons between them may not be possible.

The NHS will prioritise resources to protect emergency treatment, critical care, maternity and neonatal care, and trauma,\" he added.\n\nBut BMA workforce lead Dr Latifa Patel said there was a jointly agreed system in place with the NHS to ensure patient safety in the event of \"extreme or unforeseen circumstances\".\n\n\"We met with NHS England four times per day during the last strikes to monitor the situation, but there were no requests for a temporary stoppage of the industrial action to be made. The same proven arrangements will be in place this time.\"\n\nAnd she added: \"No-one understands better than us - the doctors who care for them - that patients are getting a sub-standard experience 365 days a year from an overstretched and understaffed NHS.\n\n\"In this brutal work environment, patient care is at risk every day.\"\n\nAre you a junior doctor with a view on the strike? Are", ".\n\n\"We haven't got enough,\" he says. \"Parts break and we haven't got spares because the factories that produce them are not in Ukraine.\"\n\nJosef doesn't only dispute some of the contents of those leaked US intelligence reports. He questions whether they have really revealed any secrets.\n\n\"Why should we be angry with the Americans?\" he asks. \"Because they gave information the Russians have had for 20 years? Ridiculous!\" Russia, he believes, has always known about the capabilities of Ukraine's armed forces.\n\nBut Russia still does not know the timing or place of Ukraine's expected offensive. It will be key to taking back territory and relieving some of the pressure being felt along Ukraine's 800 mile (1,300km) front. Wherever it happens Russia will have to redirect some of its forces.\n\nBut Ukraine too is having to arm and equip new units to conduct that offensive. Both sides are struggling to feed the front line.\n\nWe're worried our Western allies are getting tired of helping us\n\nAt another location near Bakhmut, Ukrainian troops from its 80th Brigade are already expending hundreds of artillery rounds a day, to try to repel Russia's advances.\n\nThey are already using some of the weapons supplied by the West. Serhiy and his men are operating a British made L119 light artillery gun. But Serhiy says they too are having to ration rounds. He says they're firing on average 30 rounds a day.\n\n\"We've got enough people for the moment\", he says. \"But we need ammunition. Ammunition is the most important.\"\n\nI ask Serhiy if this is the make or break year for Ukraine. \"If we go on the offensive this year and retake our land, then we'll win,\" he replies. \"But, if that doesn't happen, then we don't have the resources for the war to go on for another five to ten years.\"\n\nVolodymyr, the commander of the Grad, is even more blunt. \"The country is exhausted, the economy too,\" he says.\n\nAnd he fears that if Ukraine's action on the battlefield are not decisive this year then Western support may falter. \"We are also worried our Western allies are getting tired of helping us.\"\n\nSteven Harnett, 25, and Katie Higton, 27, were declared dead at the scene in Dalton, West Yorkshire Police say\n\nA man and a woman stabbed to death at a house in Huddersfield have been named by police.\n\nSteven Harnett, 25, and Katie Higton, 27, were found at the house in Harpe Inge, Dalton, at about 09:55 BST on Monday, West Yorkshire Police said.\n\nA 34-year-old man from Huddersfield has been arrested on suspicion of murder and is being questioned by the force.\n\nThe street remained cordoned off on Tuesday, with investigations at the scene continuing.\n\nParamedics found Mr Harnett, from Huddersfield, and Ms Higton, a mother-of four also from the town, with multiple injuries \"believed to have been inflicted by a bladed weapon\", officers said.\n\nThey were confirmed to have died at the scene.\n\nIt is believed the pair were attacked overnight between Sunday and Monday, with formal post-mortem examinations yet to be conducted.\n\nFlowers and tributes have been left on the street\n\nThe former brother and sister-in-law of Ms Higton, who asked not to be named, paid tribute to her as \"the best mum\" and said the family was \"absolutely devastated\" as they placed flowers at the scene.\n\nHe said his brother had been in a relationship with Ms Higton for seven years and was the father of her two oldest children, daughters aged nine and 10.\n\nHe told the PA news agency the children \"were in the property when the incident took place\".\n\nCards left with flowers at the scene said \"RIP my darling. We love you. No more suffering\" and \"I am so sorry for how things have ended.\"\n\nThe pair were found at the house in Harpe Inge, Huddersfield, at about 09:55 BST on Monday\n\nScott I'Anson, who lives on Harpe Inge, said he did not know Ms Higton but had seen her and her children.\n\n\"They kept to themselves but a lot of people liked them,\" he said.\n\nSpecially-trained officers are supporting their families, police said, with officers conducting patrols in the local area to reassure residents.\n\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

After a few weeks loitering on the fringes of Antarctica, it\u2019s begun to drift at pace once more.\n\nA23a, as it\u2019s known, broke away from the Antarctic coastline way back in 1986, but it's only recently begun a big migration.\n\nFor more than 30 years, it was stuck rigidly in the bottom-muds of the Weddell Sea like a static \"ice island\". A 350m-deep keel had anchored it in place.\n\nIt took gradual melting until 2020 to allow the berg to re-float and start moving again, slowly at first, before currents and winds then swept it north towards warmer air and waters.\n\nA23a is now following a path that exports so much of Antarctica's floating ice - what scientists refer to as \"iceberg alley\".\n\nIt\u2019s a path to destruction. It's going to fragment and melt to nothing in just a matter of months.\n\nToday, the behemoth is drifting along the 60th Parallel, close to the South Orkney Islands, about 700km (430 miles) northeast of the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.\n\nThe process of decay is already evident in satellite imagery and close-up photos taken from visiting ships.\n\nEvery day, large chunks are falling off into the sea.\n\nA23a is surrounding itself with an armada of off-cuts - of football-pitch-sized \"bergy bits\" and lorry-sized \"growlers\".\n\nThe interplay of winds, ocean fronts and eddies will determine A23a's precise course over the coming weeks but many of these giant, flat-topped - or tabular - bergs end up passing by South Georgia, roughly 650km (400 miles) north-east of its present position.\n\nThe British Overseas Territory, it seems, is where a lot of icebergs go to die.\n\nThe size of A23a can be hard to fully comprehend.\n\nWhen scientists working on the European Space Agency's CryoSat-2 mission used a radar altimeter on the spacecraft to estimate the iceberg\u2019s girth, they found it to have an average thickness of just over 280m (920ft). For comparison, the Shard in London, the tallest skyscraper in western Europe, is 310m (1,020ft) tall.\n\nEven sailing right up to its 30m-high cliff face wouldn't really let you grasp its scale - no more than standing in front of the facade of Buckingham Palace would let you gauge the size of London.\n\nAlthough its size is reducing with every passing day, the huge iceberg is still about 3,800 sq km (1,500 sq miles) - larger than 29 countries, including Luxembourg, Bahrain and Singapore.\n\nEnergetic waves are cutting into the berg's walls, sculpting enormous caves and arches, which are collapsing to expose wide terraces of submerged ice.\n\nBuoyancy is then forcing these terraces up to the surface, ripping away the edges of the berg in the process.\n\nBut warmer air also is gradually taking its toll.\n\nMeltwater will be collecting at the berg's surface, trickling down into cracks and forcing the fissures deeper and deeper until they break all the way to the bottom.\n\nThere may come an end point later this year when what remains of A23a simply lets go in one catastrophic moment to become a sloppy mush.\n\nA23a will have its legacy", "care has risen by more than 12% in the past year on top of bills and the 18.2% rise in food costs.\n\nAn animal welfare charity has urged people in need to use their pet food bank.\n\nThe cost of living crisis has seen more pets being given up as families struggle to afford the cost of food and medication.\n\nBut Ms Workman, from Cardiff, said her two children and five cats are the most important things in her life.\n\nAlthough she sometimes \"really struggles with money\", she says she would \"rather starve than give [her] cats away\".\n\nMs Workman, who is unemployed, said she has been \"helped tremendously\" by a pet food bank at times when she's had to skip meals to ensure her family and pets were fed.\n\n\"Sometimes, I'll feed my daughter and go without and make sure I've got food for the cats,\" she said.\n\nThe price of pet care - including pet food - has risen by 12.6% in the last year, according to latest consumer price inflation (CPI) figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\n\nThere has been a sharp increase in the costs of keeping pets\n\n\"I got these animals because I wanted them. It's not their fault that I can't afford stuff. So why should they suffer?\" she added.\n\nBefore Christmas, and the usual financial strain of the festive period, she found she needed help.\n\n\"My money was running out and I had to get presents for everybody and food.\n\n\"I was concerned that my cats would need food over Christmas as well,\" she said.\n\nMs Workman said of her cats: \"They bring laughter, and they bring joy and love. They're my family.\"\n\nA friend told her about Blue Cross, an animal welfare charity that runs a food bank in Newport.\n\nShe was given food for the cats, vital support which she has continued to receive since.\n\nGeorgie Riley says there are between 40 and 50 pets waiting to be rehomed\n\nCentre manager, Georgie Riley, 34, said she and her staff had noticed more people were using their pet food bank.\n\nShe added there were between 40 and 50 pets currently waiting to be taken in by the centre or fostered.\n\nMany of those families who are looking to have their pets rehomed are doing so for financial reasons, according to the charity.\n\n\"A lot of the time, people are working and they've just fallen on hard times and they're finding it difficult to afford pet food,\" she said.\n\n\"Our concerns are that people are not being able to feed themselves or going without other things because they're trying to feed their pets.\n\n\"Often people will come to us for help with re-homing because they've reached a breaking point.\"\n\nThe charity is looking for more foster carers for the animals.\n\nGemma Gregg has fostered over 80 different pets herself, including dogs, cats, guinea pigs and rabbits\n\nThose who foster are given the food and equipment needed to care for fostered pets while the charity also takes care of any vet bills.\n\nAnimal welfare assistant at Blue Cross, Gemma Gregg, 25, said since January the team have helped to rehome 120 pets, with 25 more in the process of being rehomed.\n\n\"It's so rewarding. It's so lovely to see them get the right care they need when they maybe haven't had that situation before.\"\n\nThe RSPCA said the cost of living crisis was \"the single biggest challenge for animal welfare right now\".\n\n\"In March alone, we received 1,517 reports about abandonments - up from 1,429 for the same month last year; a rise of 6%,\" it said.\n\n\"We will keep doing everything we can to keep pets in loving homes, and support owners.\n\n\"We've committed \u00a31.5m of extra funding to crisis measures; launched a new cost of living hub to help outline and signpost the help available, while RSPCA branches across Wales are also working with food banks in a bid to help those struggling to afford pet food.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nConstance Marten and Mark Gordon have been further arrested on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter as police search for their missing baby.\n\nA vast outdoor area in Brighton was searched through the night, and police say the infant could still be alive.\n\nBut with no trace yet, investigators fear the baby may have \"come to harm\".\n\nThe baby's parents were arrested on Monday - initially on suspicion of child neglect - after being missing for 53 days.\n\nThey were held after a member of the public saw them in a shop and called the police.\n\nThey remain in custody, but police said they had not provided any further information about the condition or whereabouts of the child.\n\nThe search for Ms Marten and Gordon - a convicted rapist and registered sex offender - began when their car was found ablaze by the side of a motorway on 5 January.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nPolice established Ms Marten had recently given birth, possibly in the back of the vehicle, without a midwife or any medical attention.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference on Tuesday, Detective Superintendent Lewis Basford, from the Metropolitan Police, said the risk to the baby - now thought to be about two months old - increased as time went on, especially amid cold weather.\n\nHe added that police must now \"be open to the fact this may not end in the way we would like\".\n\nMore than 200 officers are searching a 91-square-mile site in Sussex.\n\nSniffer dogs, drones, a police helicopter and thermal imaging cameras are being used in the search.\n\nPolice have asked members of the public between Brighton and Newhaven, in East Sussex - where the previous last known sighting of the couple was made on 8 January - to report any potential sightings, or information about where they may have been sleeping.\n\nResidents near Stanmer Villas, where the couple were arrested, have also been asked to check sheds and outbuildings.\n\nInvestigators believe Ms Marten and Gordon have been living \"in open land and open areas\".\n\nAllotments and a golf course next to a nature reserve, near to where they were arrested, were intensively searched throughout Tuesday.\n\nPolice said every available officer and member of staff had been drafted in to assist with the massive search.\n\nDet Supt Basford told journalists that little information had been gathered during police interviews with the couple and that police did not yet know the sex of their baby.\n\nConstance Marten and Mark Gordon disappeared with a newborn baby more than seven weeks ago\n\nPolice have not ruled out that someone could be harbouring the baby, though they said this was unlikely.\n\nAfter the car fire in January, police said the family safely left the scene and travelled to Liverpool, Essex, London and East Sussex in quick succession.\n\nThey appear to have taken steps to avoid detection, including covering their faces when in public, travelling at night and using cash to purchase supplies.\n\nPolice previously said Ms Marten's inherited wealth may have allowed the couple to remain at large for an extended period.\n\nPolice believe the baby was alive at the time of the last previous sighting of the family in Newhaven, but little more is known about the family's movements in the weeks since.\n\nAt the end of January, police offered a \u00a310,000 reward for information, appealing especially to anyone who might have helped the couple.\n\nAerial view of Crichel House, believed to be Ms Marten's childhood home\n\nTheir home is in Eltham, in south-east London, but they have been living nomadically since September last year, when Ms Marten first started to show signs of pregnancy.\n\nAfter the pair were found on Monday, Ms Marten's estranged father Napier Marten told the Independent he felt \"immense relief\", though this was \"tempered by the very alarming news [her] baby has yet to be found\".\n\nMs Marten, 35, is from a privileged background, having lived in a stately home growing up and attended private school.\n\nShe became estranged from her family after meeting 48-year-old Gordon at drama school in 2016.\n\nAn FBI agent-turned-Russian mole who is notorious as one of the most damaging spies in US", "which produces the event, said Russia's inclusion could bring the competition into disrepute \"in light of the unprecedented crisis in Ukraine\".\n\nRussia launched an attack on its neighbour Ukraine in the early hours of Thursday.\n\nWestern governments have ramped up international sanctions in response.\n\nJust 24 hours ago, the contest had said Russia would be allowed to compete, so this is a rapid change in stance for the EBU.\n\nIt follows the announcement that football's 2022 Champions League final would be played in Paris, after Russia was stripped of the match following the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nF1's Russian Grand Prix, due to take place in Sochi in September, was also cancelled.\n\nEarlier this week, Ukrainian broadcaster UA:PBC urged the EBU to suspend Russia's Eurovision membership and ban it from the contest.\n\nState broadcasters from countries including Iceland, Finland, Norway and the Netherlands had called for Russia to be banned from the contest.\n\nFinland said if Russia took part, it would not send a representative to the contest in Turin in May.\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

Glad to see Eurovision taking action and kicking Russia out.\"\n\nThe 66th edition of Eurovision is due to take place in Turin, after Italian rock band Maneskin won the 2021 contest.\n\nManizha represented Russia at last year's Eurovision Song Contest with an ode to female empowerment, Russian Woman\n\nRussia had not announced its act for the contest, which it last won in 2008 with Dima Bilan singing Believe.\n\nIn recent years, it has been one of the strongest Eurovision performers, with five top five finishes in the past decade.\n\nUkraine has selected hip-hop trio Kalush Orchestra, whose song Stefania was written as a tribute to their mothers.\n\nThe band replaced the country's original contestant, Alina Pash, who withdrew last week after facing scrutiny over a trip she made to Russia-controlled Crimea in 2015.\n\nWhile there is no suggestion Pash entered Crimea from Russia, she said the controversy over her visit had overshadowed her participation in the contest.\n\nThe Ukrainian government considers people who enter the territory via Russia to have crossed the border illegally.\n\nTensions between Russia and Ukraine have overshadowed previous editions of the song contest.\n\nRussia were favourites to win the competition in 2016, until Ukrainian singer Jamala stole a last-minute victory with a song that depicted the deportation of Crimean Tatars by Josef Stalin in 1944 - a horrific chapter the nation's parliament has described as tantamount to genocide.\n\nThe lyrics were widely interpreted as a criticism of Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. Jamala, who is herself a Crimean Tartar, appeared to confirm the link when she told the press: \"The main message is to remember and to know this story. When we know, we prevent.\"\n\nOn the path to victory, her song picked up several important votes from former Soviet countries who have traditionally voted for Russia. Eurovision expert John Kennedy O'Connor called the result \"a pointed slap in Russia's face\".\n\nA year later, Russian contestant Julia Samoylova was blocked from entering Ukraine, which was hosting the competition, because she had reportedly toured Crimea without entering it through the border with the Ukrainian mainland.\n\nRussian television station Channel One then announced it would not broadcast the contest or take part.\n\nJamala has now called on Eurovision fans not to ignore Russia's actions in Ukraine.\n\n\"I don't know how this is possible, but they bombed peaceful people,\" she said in an Instagram video. \"Please support Ukraine.

According to the lawyer, Italian judges allowed Mr Cozzolino to stay at home because he has heart problems - and Mr Conte does not believe he would receive proper care in a Belgian prison.\n\nThe lawyer cited a 2022 Council of Europe report which highlighted \"overcrowding\" and \"clearly insufficient\" health services in four Belgian prisons, four years after the body called for Belgium to improve conditions for inmates, particularly at times when prison staff are on strike.\n\nBut Alberto Alemanno, professor of EU law at HEC Paris, dismissed Mr Conte's allegations as \"fictitious\". He accused him of \"leveraging the health status of Mr Cozzolino in order to somehow tarnish... a very difficult investigation across Europe\", arguing they were a delaying tactic.\n\n\"[These allegations] sound very useful to satisfy the private interest of an individual who is currently suspected of major breaches of the rule of law,\" he told the BBC.\n\nMarc Tarabella, Eva Kaili, Pier Antonio Panzeri and Andrea Cozzolino are the four current and former MEPs wrapped up in Qatargate\n\nMr Alemanno described European Arrest Warrants as the \"bread and butter\" of European justice, and said Mr Cozzolino's attempts to challenge it were \"very unusual\" - adding that the Belgian investigation so far into the corruption allegations had been \"extremely thorough\", and that Belgian prisons compared favourably with others around Europe.\n\n\"[The prosecutors] are following the rules of the game, which basically stem from the European Court of Human Rights case law,\" he said.\n\n\"We're seeing a bit of a David and Goliath situation in which the Belgian authorities seem to find a lot of pushback from the political system, from the institutional system, and from third countries at the origin of this case.\"\n\nAfter the interview with Mr Conte the BBC sent all his allegations to the prosecutor's office in Belgium that is leading the investigation. A spokesman for the prosecutor twice refused to comment.\n\nThe BBC has also reached out to the Belgian prison service for comment but has not yet received a response.\n\nThe investigation began in December when Greek MEP Eva Kaili was arrested along with three others on suspicion of corruption and money-laundering. She denies the charges.\n\nA Financial Times article says on the day of her arrest Ms Kaili stuffed \u20ac300,000 ($326,000; \u00a3264,000) into a suitcase along with nappies and baby food for her daughter. The two-year-old child is now only allowed to visit her jailed mother twice a month.\n\nThe police have seized \u20ac1.5m in cash since the start of the investigation, in raids across Belgium, Italy and France.\n\nSince then two more MEPs - Mr Cozzolino and Belgian politician Marc Tarabella - have had their legal immunity stripped by the European Parliament. Mr Tarabella, who also denies wrongdoing, is now in a Belgian prison awaiting trial.\n\nBelgian police have released pictures of the cash seized in December's raids\n\nInvestigators believe a criminal network took bribes from Qatar and Morocco in return for influencing the European Parliament in Brussels.\n\nFormer Italian MEP Pier Antonio Panzeri allegedly led that network. He later agreed to a plea deal with prosecutors - agreeing to reveal everything about the scheme in exchange for a reduced sentence of one year in custody. Charges against his wife and daughter were also dropped as part of that agreement, and Mr Panzeri has since moved to house arrest.\n\nThe BBC has seen leaked transcripts from interviews that investigators held with Mr Panzeri in February.\n\nAccording to these documents, the former politician told them that Qatar donated \u20ac250,000 each to Mr Cozzolino and Ms Kaili for their electoral campaigns.\n\nHe also allegedly said Francesco Giorgi - who worked as a parliamentary assistant for Mr Cozzolino, and who is the partner of Ms Kaili - distributed the Qatari cash.\n\nMr Giorgi has reportedly confessed to acting as the bag man for the network. On his LinkedIn page, he lists himself as co-founder of the NGO Fight Impunity - a group set up by Mr Panzeri in 2019 to promote human rights.\n\nFight Impunity shares a Brussels office building with another group, named No Peace Without Justice. Niccol\u00f2 Fig\u00e0-Talamanca, the secretary general of the latter NGO, was initially arrested by investigators but was then released in February.

When you work in a colliery, you're a family.\"\n\nAsked how he was feeling, he said: \"I can't describe it. I'm sorry. I wish I could, I wish I could find words to describe it, but I can't.\n\n\"When you're under pressure for two years, not knowing which way it's going to go.\"\n\nHunter spoke to the media outside court after he was released from custody\n\nHis legal team had argued he should be given a suspended sentence, in a case which was a court first in the country.\n\nThey had initially suggested he would be released by 18 August, but prison authorities freed him on Monday after they officially calculated his release date.\n\nIn mitigation last week, his defence lawyer Ritsa Pekri said his motive was to \"liberate his wife from all that she was going through due to her health conditions\".\n\nThe court heard it was Mrs Hunter's \"wish\" to die and that her husband \"had only feelings of love for her\".\n\nHunter, who was originally from Ashington, said he would \"never in a million years\" have suffocated his wife of 52 years unless she had asked him to.\n\nHe showed the court how he held his hands over Mrs Hunter's mouth and nose and said he eventually decided to grant her her wish after she became \"hysterical\".\n\nThe court heard he then tried to kill himself by taking an overdose, but paramedics arrived in time to save him.\n\nThe couple were married for more than 50 years\n\nPreviously state prosecutor Andreas Hadjikyrou had told the BBC Hunter killed his wife for \"selfish motives\", adding: \"It's himself he was taking care of.\"\n\nHe had told the court Janice died from asphyxiation, telling three judges it was a \"horrible death\" and her end was \"not painless or peaceful\".\n\nProsecutors said Janice still went to the hairdresser every fortnight which, they said, proved she had a social life and took care of herself.\n\nSentencing Hunter,", "both juries reached the correct verdicts.\"\n\nShe said Mr Mendy had \"tried to remain strong\" but the process had \"inevitably had a serious impact on him\".\n\nHe now wanted to ask for his privacy to be respected \"so he can begin rebuilding his life,\" Ms Wiltshire added.\n\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

And hopefully the families will find some peace from the service.\"\n\nDuring the service, a moment of silence will be held and Ms Gould will be preaching about the Gospel passage of Jesus stilling in the storm.\n\nShe added: \"I'm going to be talking about how grief can sometimes feel like a storm that's overwhelming and we don't know how to feel.\n\nHarvey (L) and Kyrees were friends since nursery\n\n\"We can have all kinds of feelings that we can't manage and I'm going to be encouraging them to reach out for that peace that Jesus brought when he stilled the storm and that he longs to still the storms of our lives.\"\n\nRoad closures are being managed by Cardiff council and schools in the area will also close due to the number of mourners expected.\n\nTy Coch Road, from the roundabout with Archer Road, and Grand Avenue, from its junction with Howell Road, will both be closed from midday to 14:00 BST.\n\nThe service will begin at 13:00 at Church of the Resurrection in Ely.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\n\nGary Glitter was one of the biggest music stars of the 1970s\n\nDisgraced former pop star Gary Glitter has been recalled to prison after breaching his licence conditions, the Probation Service has said.\n\nThe singer, whose real name is Paul Gadd, was freed in February after serving half his 16-year jail term for sexually abusing three schoolgirls.\n\nHis recall comes just over a month since being freed.\n\nUpon release, he was subject to licence conditions including having a GPS tag.\n\nThe pop star, 79, was one of the biggest music stars of the 1970s.\n\nHe was jailed in 2015 for attempted rape, four counts of indecent assault and one of having sex with a girl under 13.\n\nA Probation Service spokesperson said protecting the public was their \"number one priority\", adding: \"That's why we set tough licence conditions and when offenders breach them, we don't hesitate to return them to custody.\"\n\nGadd had been held at HMP The Verne, a low security category C jail in Portland, Dorset.\n\nWhen he was released he was also subject to close monitoring by the police and probation officers, with the Ministry of Justice saying at the time sex offenders \"face some of the strictest licence conditions\".\n\nGadd was not added to the sex offenders register for these crimes, because they were committed before the register was introduced. However, he was already ordered to sign the register for life when he returned to the UK after he was found guilty of sexually abusing two young girls in Vietnam in 2006.\n\nGadd had been at the height of his fame when he attacked two girls aged 12 and 13 after inviting them backstage to his dressing room.\n\nHis youngest victim had been less than 10 years old when he crept into her bed and tried to rape her in 1975.\n\nGadd had denied allegations against him but was found guilty after a trial lasting three weeks.\n\nIn 2015 at the time of sentencing, Judge McCreath said he could find \"no real evidence that\" Gadd had atoned for his crimes and described his abuse of a girl under 10 as \"appalling\".\n\nThe allegations that led to Gadd's imprisonment came to light when he became the first person to be arrested under Operation Yewtree - the investigation launched by the Met in 2012 in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal.\n\nGadd, who performed as Gary Glitter, had three UK number ones including I'm the Leader of the Gang (I am!).\n\nHis fall from grace began decades later in 1999 after he admitted possessing thousands of images that showed child sex abuse and was jailed for four months.\n\nUpon being freed he went abroad and in 2002 was expelled from Cambodia amid sex crime allegations.\n\nHe was later convicted of sexually abusing two young girls in neighbouring Vietnam in March 2006 and spent two-and-a-half years in jail.\n\nOn returning to the UK in 2008, he was forced to sign the sex offenders register. In 2012, he was arrested at his London home following an investigation by detectives, before the case that led to his latest conviction came to trial in January 2015.\n\nWhen Beyonc\u00e9 turned up to the Grammys in a cowboy hat, we should have known that something was afoot.\n\nA week later, she officially announced her country era - dropping two surprise singles in the middle of the Super Bowl.\n\nOne of them, the banjo-riffic Texas Hold 'Em, became the star's biggest hit in years. In the UK, it was number one for four weeks - her longest-ever spell at the top.\n\nNashville reacted with a shrug. Country radio only gave the song modest airplay, even as millions of streams propelled it to the top of Billboard's country chart.\n\nThis was pretty much what Beyonc\u00e9 expected.\n\nAs a Texan, country music is her birth right but, in an Instagram post last week, she wrote that her new album, Cowboy Carter, was \"born out of an experience that I had years ago where I did not feel welcomed\".\n\nThis was likely a reference to her appearance at the 2016 Country Music Awards, where she performed her song Daddy Lessons with The Chicks (then known as the Dixie Chicks).\n\nBoth performers were deemed unwelcome - The Chicks had faced a backlash in the US after criticising former President George W Bush during the Iraq War; while Beyonc\u00e9's vocal support of Black Lives Matter had upset many on the American right.\n\nTheir performance faced a barrage of criticism - and racism - online. Natalie Maines, lead singer of The Chicks, later told the New York Times that the way Beyonc\u00e9 was treated after the show was \"disgusting.\"\n\nIn her Instagram post, Beyonc\u00e9 said the experience prompted her to take \"a deeper dive into the history of country\".\n\n", "ooligans.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Mr Shoigu briefed Russian military officials on Moscow's response to the Belgorod raid.\n\nHe said \"more than 70 Ukrainian nationalists\" had been killed and the rest pushed back into Ukraine.\n\n\"We will continue to respond to such actions by Ukrainian militants promptly and extremely harshly,\" the Russian defence minister added.\n\nMoscow says several civilians were injured during the incursion.\n\nRussia released photos of abandoned or damaged Western military vehicles - but some experts say the images are staged\n\nRussia posted pictures of destroyed US vehicles apparently at the scene of the fighting in the Belgorod region - but some Ukrainian military experts and bloggers have suggested they could have been staged.\n\nThe US said it was sceptical that reports of US-supplied weapons being used in the incursion were true and did not \"encourage or enable strikes inside of Russia\".\n\nBut Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the vehicles were evidence of growing Western military involvement in Ukraine.\n\n\"It is no secret for us that more and more equipment is being delivered to Ukraine's armed forces.

One MP said students faced a \"lottery\" when it came to quality of mental health provision across the sector.\n\nMr Halfon said a statutory duty of care \"may not be the most effective intervention\" but that he was \"not closing the door on future legislation\".\n\nHe said he had written to universities asking them to sign up to the University Mental Health Charter - a set of principles developed by the charity Student Minds to help institutions prioritise mental health.\n\nMr Halfon said 61 universities had already signed up, but Universities UK (UUK) has 140 members and \"it's time the rest got on board\".\n\nHe added: \"I'm confident that higher education can meet this challenge, but I have made absolutely clear that if this response is not satisfactory I will go further and ask the Office for Students to look at the merits of a new registration condition on mental health.\"\n\nInstitutions in England need to register with the OfS in order to call themselves \"universities\", award their own degrees, access different types of funding, and recruit international students.\n\nMr Halfon also said a new taskforce would propose targets for universities and a plan to help them better identify students at risk by the end of this year, with a final report due by May 2024.\n\nAnd he said there would be a national review of university student deaths.\n\nAmong those who travelled to London for the debate were Bob and Maggie Abrahart, whose daughter Natasha took her own life at the University of Bristol, in 2018, on the day she was due to give a presentation in a large lecture theatre.\n\nNatasha had a social anxiety-disorder that made public speaking hard - and after her death, her parents sued the university over its failure to make adjustments.\n\nThey partly won their case, under the Equality Act, but the judge was not satisfied the university had owed Natasha a duty of care, saying there was \"no statute or precedent which establishes the existence of such a duty of care owed by a university to a student\".\n\nThe couple, from Nottinghamshire, said Natasha had been a \"very sweet caring person\" who really wanted to study physics at university. And they were pleased the issue, all about \"providing education safely\", was \"finally on the agenda\".\n\nBob and Maggie Abrahart, pictured with their daughter Natasha, are pleased the debate is finally on the agenda\n\nThe petition calls for the extension to all students of the existing duty of care to protect those under the age of 18, and staff, from \"reasonably foreseeable harm\" caused by direct injury or a failure to act.\n\nBut UUK says this would not be practical, proportionate or the best way to support students.\n\nSome providers may have 50,000 registered students, with most living outside the university, it said.\n\nUUK president and University of the West of England vice-chancellor Prof Steve West said he welcomed the measures set out, and that higher education providers should continue to demonstrate progress on student mental health and suicide prevention.\n\n\"University leaders recognise the profound impact that suicide has upon families, and the university community, as well as the petitioners' personal experience of loss,\" he said.\n\nBefore the debate, the Department for Education said higher education providers had a general duty of care \"to deliver educational and pastoral services\" and further legislation \"would be a disproportionate response\".\n\nUniversities are now advised to contact key family members or friends if they have serious concerns about a student's mental health - even without their permission.\n\nOfficial estimates suggest 64 students killed themselves in England and Wales in the 2019-20 academic year, a significantly lower proportion than among the general population of similar ages.\n\nBut the families say universities do not report the annual number of student suicides - and the number is higher.\n\nIf you have been affected by any of these issues, you can visit the BBC's Action Line or contact the Samaritans.\n\nThe Prince of Wales and Catherine, Princess of Wales, have been meeting crowds celebrating the King's Coronation on the Long Walk in Windsor.\n\nThousands have been taking part in street parties across the UK as part of the Coronation Big Lunch.\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen is urging Congress to act 'as soon as possible'\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned that the US may run out of cash by 1 June if Congress fails to raise or suspend the debt ceiling.\n\nReaching the debt ceiling would mean that the government is unable to borrow any more money.\n\nOn Monday, Ms Yellen urged Congress to act \"as soon as possible\" to address the $31.4tr (\u00a325.12tr) limit.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has called a meeting of congressional leaders on the issue on 9 May.\n\nThe debt ceiling has been raised, extended or revised 78 times since 1960.\n\nIn this instance, House Republicans have demanded drastic spending cuts and a reversal of some aspects of President Biden's agenda - including his student loan forgiveness programme and green energy tax credits - in exchange for votes to raise the debt ceiling. This, in turn, has prompted objections from Democrats in the Senate and from President Biden, who said last week that the issue is \"not negotiable\".\n\nThe president, however, is coming under increasing pressure from business groups - including the US Chamber of Congress - to discuss Republican proposals.\n\nA default - which would be the first in US history - could upend global financial markets and shatter trust in the US as a global business partner.\n\nExperts have warned that a default could also see the US head into a recession and lead to rising unemployment.\n\nIt would also mean that the US would be unable to borrow money to pay the salaries of government employees and military personnel, social security cheques or for other obligations, such as defence contractor payments.\n\nEven weather forecasts could ultimately be impacted, as many rely on data from the federally-funded National Weather Service.\n\nIn a letter to members of Congress on Tuesday, Ms Yellen said that \"We have learned", "on his return from Libya four days before the attack.\n\nThe public inquiry also found Abedi was probably assisted by someone in Libya but it was not possible, on the available evidence, to say who this might have been.\n\nIt is the first time an official conclusion has been made about the possible involvement of other people from abroad.\n\nIn making this finding, Sir John contradicts an MI5 assessment which said no-one other than Salman Abedi and his brother Hashem were knowingly involved in the plot.\n\nTwenty-two people were killed and hundreds more injured in the explosion\n\nThe report also found that while Didsbury Mosque in south Manchester, where the Abedi family worshipped, was not an active factor in the brothers' radicalisation, politicisation did happen there.\n\nSir John said \"there was a form of wilful blindness\" to some activities, and \"weak leadership\".\n\nDidsbury Mosque chairman Fawzi Haffar told the BBC he disagreed with Sir John and added: \"The chairman can say whatever he wants.\n\n\"The chairman has not been to the mosque, none of the lawyers have been to the mosque, they don't know the workings of the mosque.\n\n\"I would say to him [the chairman] that they are wrong,\" Mr Haffar added.\n\nThe report concluded that the Abedi family held \"significant responsibility\" for the radicalisation of Salman and Hashem Abedi.\n\nThose family members responsible include their father Ramadan Abedi, mother Samia Tabbal and elder brother Ismail Abedi, each of whom has held extremist views, the inquiry found.\n\nBut Sir John said, other than Hashem Abedi, there was insufficient evidence to attribute specific knowledge of the attack to them.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: Inquiry chairman Sir John Saunders speaks of \"significant missed opportunity\" to stop the attack\n\nSir John's comments were published in the inquiry's third and final report into the atrocity, which dealt with the radicalisation of Abedi and whether the attack could have been prevented.\n\nThe first volume has been made publicly available while the second has only been circulated to a limited readership of people with security clearance.\n\nThis does not include the families of those who died, their legal teams, or the media as its contents would be damaging to national security if made public, the inquiry was told.\n\nThe inquiry process began more than three years ago, and there were 194 days of oral evidence from 267 witnesses.\n\nA minute's silence was held at Manchester Town Hall for the victims before Sir John read out his findings, which included key recommendations.\n\nIt seems a contradiction of the term \"public inquiry\" to keep some findings private, but the chairman says that he had to balance the principle of open justice with the issue of national security.\n\nHe's added that all private evidence has been scrutinised to make sure that restricting it can't be seen as a \"cloak to cover up mistakes\".\n\nGiven that the previous two inquiry reports were highly critical of the private companies and public authorities involved with the arena and the emergency response, this document was also expected to be tough on MI5.\n\nBereaved families and survivors will be pleased that in some areas the report doesn't pull its punches.\n\nThey'll find it upsetting to hear that the security service missed a significant opportunity. But there will also be some frustration that they'll never learn the full detail of exactly what that opportunity involved.\n\nAndrew Roussos, whose eight-year-old daughter Saffie-Rose was killed in the blast, said hearing how this tragedy might have been avoided was \"devastating for us all\".\n\n\"This was a cataclysmic failure... In my view the fact that MI5 failed to stop him despite all of the red flags available demonstrates they are not fit to keep us safe and therefore not fit for purpose.\"\n\nCaroline Curry, whose 19-year-old son Liam was killed in the attack, said: \"From top to bottom, MI5 to the associates of the attacker, we will always believe you all played a part in the murder of our children.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Earlier this month he pled not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records.\n\nMr Trump is also facing a civil trial over an allegation that he raped an advice columnist nearly three decades ago.\n\nPolice Scotland declined to comment on whether they were made aware of Mr Trump's impending visit.\n\nIt is unclear what days Mr Trump will be in Scotland, however he is expected to land at Shannon Airport in Ireland on 3 May.\n\nWhile in Ireland he is expected stay at his Trump International Hotel and Golf Links on the outskirts of Doonbeg in County Clare.\n\nMr Trump was indicted on business fraud charges but has argued there is no case against him.\n\nHe pled not guilty to falsifying business records to hide damaging information ahead of the 2016 election.\n\nThe charges stem from a hush money payment to adult film star, Stormy Daniels.\n\nHe is the first US president in history to face a criminal trial.\n\nThousands marched in Edinburgh in protest to Donald Trump's previous visit\n\nMr Trump previously visited Scotland in July 2018 while in office, sparking a major security operation.\n\nHe spent two days at his Turnberry resort with wife Melania as part of a four-day trip to the UK", "and statements has been released by the MPs investigating Boris Johnson over Partygate, ahead of a hearing crucial to his political future.\n\nIncluded is evidence from the UK's top civil servant saying he did not give the former PM assurances about whether Covid rules were followed in No 10.\n\nMr Johnson has admitted he did mislead MPs over Partygate but not on purpose.\n\nHe says Wednesday's televised hearing will vindicate him.\n\nThe former PM, who was ousted from office last year after a string of scandals, faces being a potential suspension if MPs decide he deliberately misled them.\n\nThe seven-member Commons privileges committee is investigating whether what Mr Johnson told Parliament stopped it from properly holding him to account.\n\nAt 14.00 GMT on Wednesday, the committee will get its chance to question Mr Johnson live on TV, in a hearing that could last several hours.\n\nHe is expected to be flanked by members of his taxpayer-funded legal team, with whom he will be able to confer during the session.\n\nHowever, he will have to answer questions himself, and will take an oath on the King James Bible before the hearing begins.\n\nThe committee is expected to focus on statements Mr Johnson made about Downing Street gatherings on 1 December and 8 December 2021, and subsequently.\n\nBefore the hearing, the committee has published what it calls a \"core bundle\" of evidence that is expected to be referred to during the hearing.\n\nA written submission from Simon Case, the most senior civil servant in the UK, is part of the 110-page bundle of documents published on the committee's website.\n\nIt is a Q&A form, dated 6 February 2023, which asks Mr Case whether he gave Mr Johnson any assurance that \"Covid rules were followed at all times in No 10 and specifically in relation to gatherings covered in the Sue Gray report\".\n\nIn his response, Mr Case answered: \"No.\"\n\nBut evidence submitted by Conservative MP Sarah Dines appears to contradict Mr Case's answer.\n\nIn her written submission, Ms Dines said she recalled a meeting with Mr Johnson in the cabinet room, during which the former PM was advised Covid rules were followed \"at all times\".\n\nMs Dines said she was \"sure\" civil servants were present and she was \"90% sure one of them was Simon Case\".\n\nEvidence from other Number 10 officials, as well as emails, messages and details of Mr Johnson's diary have been published, alongside extracts of official advice for the public at the time of the pandemic.\n\nIn written evidence Martin Reynolds, the former principal private secretary to the then prime minister, questioned Mr Johnson's plan to say Covid guidance had been followed at all times in Downing Street.\n\nHe said he queried a line proposed for Mr Johnson to say at Prime Minister's Questions on 8 December.\n\nMr Reynolds said: \"He did not welcome the interruption but told me that he had received reassurances that the comms event was within the rules.\n\n\"I accepted this but questioned whether it was realistic to argue that all guidance had been followed at all times, given the nature of the working environment in No 10.\"\n\nThe committee also published exchanges about a drinks party in Downing Street's garden in May 2020.\n\nIn written evidence, Lee Cain, who was then the No 10 communications director, said he raised concerns that the garden party would be a \"communications risk\".\n\nHe said he and Mr Reynolds then discussed whether to go ahead with the event. Mr Cain said Mr Reynolds said he would speak to the prime minister but \"he was sure it was okay\".\n\nMr Cain said Dominic Cummings, Mr Johnson's chief adviser at the time, agreed the gathering \"should not take place\" and said he would \"raise the issue with Martin and the prime minister\".\n\nMr Cain said Mr Cummings later confirmed that he had \"informed the PM\", but they had argued about other issues and \"he was clearly very frustrated\".\n\nAnother submission from a No 10 official said Mr Johnson often \"saw and joined gatherings\" in Downing Street. \"He had the opportunity to shut them down, but joined in, made speeches, had a drink with staff,\" the official wrote. \"He could see what was happening and allowed the culture to continue.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: Johnson's comments in the Commons on Partygate scandal\n\nAll the evidence amassed by the committee, including written statements from 23 witnesses, official diaries, and emails between officials, has already been handed over to Mr Johnson's legal team.\n\nHis lawyers have given the committee 46 WhatsApp messages between the former prime minister and five unnamed people.\n\nMedia stories about staff parties in Downing Street when Covid rules banned socialising indoors began to emerge in late 2021, later becoming known as the Partygate scandal.\n\nOn a number of occasions, Mr Johnson told the House of Commons that Covid rules and guidance had been followed in Downing Street.\n\nBut an inquiry by senior official Sue Gray later found rule-breaking had taken place at multiple events, and police issued fines to 83 people, including Mr Johnson himself, for breaching Covid laws.\n\nThe committee, chaired by veteran Labour MP Harriet Harman, but with a Conservative majority, said earlier this month that breaches of pandemic guidance would have been \"obvious\" to him at the time.\n\nBut that was rejected by Mr Johnson on Tuesday, in a 52-page document setting out his defence ahead of the TV hearing.\n\nHe said he did not \"intentionally or recklessly\" mislead MPs and his assurances to MPs that lockdown rules had been followed were made in \"good faith\".\n\nWales' scheme is to start in two years, after Scotland's scheme was delayed\n\nThe Welsh government intends to press on with plans for a refundable bottles and cans fee after the UK government blocked similar ones in Scotland.\n\nThe scheme is set to start in Wales in two years, but Scotland's scheme was delayed last week after Westminster said glass could not be included.\n\nThe UK government said its decision would affect Wales' plans too.\n\nClimate Change minister Julie James said she would take the UK government \"to task\".\n\nThe UK government has decided not to include glass bottles in its own deposit return scheme, and told the Scottish government it wanted glass excluded so a consistent UK-wide approach was taken.\n\nWestminster used post-Brexit legislation called the Internal Markets Bill to stop Scotland's plans.\n\nJulie James said she would take the UK government \"to task\"\n\nMs James said her reading of the UK Internal Markets Bill was that no single nation could interrupt the commerce of the others.\n\nShe said: \"It's England that's the outlier here, not Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and they need to understand that.\"\n\nUnder the Welsh government plans, people would get their money back if they returned empty drinks containers made of plastic, glass, steel or aluminium.\n\nMs James insisted the Welsh government would continue to roll out its scheme in two years.\n\n\"We don't think we need the permission of the UK government to do that,\" she said.\n\nAndrew RT Davies said Labour liked doing things differently \"for the sake of it\"\n\nThe Welsh government consulted jointly with the UK government and Northern Ireland executive on its plans.\n\nWhen the UK government decided not to include glass it cited concerns about creating complexity and burdens for business.\n\nThe UK government said it wanted to deliver a consistent approach for the deposit return scheme across the UK, providing a simple and effective system for both businesses and consumers.\n\n\"We have listened to industry. Businesses have been clear that adding glass to a deposit return scheme will add fundamental complexity for our pubs and restaurants, increase burdens on small businesses, whilst creating greater inconvenience for consumers,\" it said.\n\nWelsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies accused Ms James of being different for the sake of it.\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

This time they're told they've hit the target.\n\nVolodymyr however, is frustrated they can't do more. \"We could have provided more support to our guys who are dying there.\"\n\nHe says Ukraine has already burned through its own stocks of Grad ammunition, so is relying on rockets sourced from other countries. Volodymyr says supplies are coming from the Czech Republic, Romania and Pakistan. He complains the rockets originating from Pakistan are \"not of a good quality\".\n\nUkraine's call for more weapons and ammunition has only become louder the longer the war has gone on. The focus now is preparing for a major offensive. But at the same time Ukraine is still having to expend huge resources on just maintaining its position.\n\nDespite the recent arrival of modern weapons - like tanks and armoured vehicles - Ukraine remains heavily reliant on its older, Soviet-era arsenal.\n\nThe Russian-made Buk air defence system, which can target aircraft, drones and missiles, is still one of its prized possessions. We get rare access to see one further along the front line - also hidden in a wooded area.\n\nThis sophisticated weaponry has helped prevent Russia gaining control of the skies.\n\nJosef, the Buk commander, tells me it's \"target number one for Russia\". This explains the extreme care taken to protect it. The long vehicle with its radar dome is buried in a deep trench covered with camouflage netting. On top are two grey missiles. Normally it carries four.\n\nSerhiy fears Ukraine won't have resources for the war to go on for five or ten years\n\nA cache of classified US documents was leaked online earlier this month - maps, charts and photos - revealing detailed intelligence gathered on the war.\n\nI ask Josef if these were correct in highlighting an acute shortage of Buk missiles. \"No, that's not true,\" he insists. But he does admit that the Buk is proving hard to maintain and Ukraine needs more.\n\n\"We haven't got enough,\" he says. \"Parts break and we haven't got spares because the factories that produce them are not in Ukraine.\"\n\nJosef doesn't only dispute some of the contents of those leaked US intelligence reports. He questions whether they have really revealed any secrets.\n\n\"Why should we be angry with the Americans?\" he asks. \"Because they gave information the Russians have had for 20 years? Ridiculous!\" Russia, he believes, has always known about the capabilities of Ukraine's armed forces.\n\nBut Russia still does not know the timing or place of Ukraine's expected offensive. It will be key to taking back territory and relieving some of the pressure being felt along Ukraine's 800 mile (1,300km) front. Wherever it happens Russia will have to redirect some of its forces.\n\nBut Ukraine too is having to arm and equip new units to conduct that offensive. Both sides are struggling to feed the front line.\n\nWe're worried our Western allies are getting tired of helping us\n\nAt another location near Bakhmut, Ukrainian troops from its 80th Brigade are already expending hundreds of artillery rounds a day, to try to repel Russia's advances.\n\nThey are already using some of the weapons supplied by the West. Serhiy and his men are operating a British made L119 light artillery gun. But Serhiy says they too are having to ration rounds. He says they're firing on average 30 rounds a day.\n\n\"We've got enough people for the moment\", he says. \"But we need ammunition. Ammunition is the most important.\"\n\nI ask Serhiy if this is the make or break year for Ukraine. \"If we go on the offensive this year and retake our land, then we'll win,\" he replies. \"But, if that doesn't happen, then we don't have the resources for the war to go on for another five to ten years.\"\n\nVolodymyr, the commander of the Grad, is even more blunt. \"The country is exhausted, the economy too,\" he says.\n\nAnd he fears that if Ukraine's action on the battlefield are not decisive this year then Western support may falter. \"We are also worried our Western allies are getting tired of helping us.\"\n\nIvan Ryabov, who subjected female anti-war protestors to brutal interrogations, was among those sanctioned\n\nTwo Moscow police officers identified by the BBC as perpetrators of abuses against female anti-war protesters have been sanctioned by the EU.\n\nThe EU accused Ivan Ryabov and Alexander Fedorinov of arbitrary arrest and torture.\n\nThey were among nine people and three institutions sanctioned over sexual and gender-based violence, to coincide with International Women's Day on Wednesday.\n\nOthers included Taliban ministers and officials from South Sudan and Myanmar.\n\nA BBC Eye investigation detailed how Ivan Ryabov was identified by protesters who had been physically abused by him when they were detained in March 2022.\n\nAlexander Fedorinov was identified by the BBC using facial recognition software.\n\nAnnouncing the sanctions in a statement, EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Police Josep Borrell said the EU was moving \"from words to action\" in its commitment to \"eliminate all forms of violence of violence against women\".\n\nHe said the sanctions were \"enhancing efforts to counter sexual and gender-based violence, to ensure that those responsible are fully accountable for their actions, and to combat impunity\".\n\nThe two Moscow police officers were sanctioned for their role in \"arbitrary arrests and detentions as well as torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment in the context of the censor", "s ability to win the war.\n\nHe also warned that Russia was planning a fresh offensive, just as reports began emerging from Ukraine of missile strikes following drone attacks overnight.\n\nOn Thursday, the US designated Russia's Wagner group, which is believed to have thousands of mercenaries in Ukraine, a transnational criminal organisation.\n\nIt also imposed fresh sanctions on the group and their associates to \"further impede [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's ability to arm and equip his war machine\", Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in the statement.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nShazia Saddiq and Sue Palmer said the scandal had had a \"devastating\" impact on their lives\n\n\"I lost absolutely everything. It has been absolutely horrendous.\"\n\nShazia Saddiq is one of many former Post Office branch managers wrongly accused of crimes due to accounting errors caused by a faulty IT system.\n\nAlong with Sue Palmer, who told the BBC the allegations \"ruined my life\", the pair are still waiting for full compensation several years on.\n\nA report on Monday called for action and law changes to stop issues \"blocking full and fair compensation\".\n\nThe head of an inquiry into the Post Office scandal, Sir Wyn Williams, said schemes set up to compensate sub-postmasters and sub-postmistress wrongly accused of crimes were a \"patchwork quilt with some holes in it\".\n\nBetween 2000 and 2014, more than 700 Post Office branch managers were given criminal convictions when faulty accounting software, called Horizon, made it look as though money was missing from their sites.\n\nThe cases constitute Britain's most widespread miscarriage of justice. Some people went to prison following convictions for false accounting and theft, and many were financially ruined. Some victims have since died.\n\nThere has been a public inquiry, led by Sir Wyn, which has been examining the treatment of thousands of sub-postmasters, and to establish who was to blame for the wrongful prosecutions and why nothing was done to prevent them.\n\nSir Wyn said on Monday that his criticisms over delays in compensation \"remain justified\".\n\nMs Saddiq, 39, along with fellow former sub-postmistress Mrs Palmer told the BBC the scandal had had a \"devastating\" impact on their lives.\n\nMs Saddiq, who used to run three Post Offices in Newcastle upon Tyne, said she had \"lost everything\" as a result of being accused of crimes a decade ago, including her home above one branch.\n\nShe did not end up facing criminal prosecution, but she had to leave the area with her two young children after being assaulted with flour in the street.\n\n\"I had to flee, me and my children overnight. They left their friends behind, they had to change schools,\" she said.\n\nMrs Palmer, who was found not guilty after a trial, said the allegations had \"ruined my life\".\n\n\"I was made homeless, I now live in a one-bedroom studio flat (because of the financial impact),\" she said.\n\nMrs Palmer, from Essex, had previously told the BBC she received a compensation payment in December, but soon realised it was not what it seemed, with a significant chunk of the money going straight to pay her creditors. She is now seeking proper compensation for the scandal.\n\nThe former postmistresses welcomed the latest report by Sir Wyn, but both called for the compensation process to be sped up.\n\n\"To keep a human being in this fight mode for such a long time, it's torturous. I want to be free from this now,\" Ms Saddiq said.\n\nMrs Palmer added: \"Words are no good now, we need actions. We need the Post Office to have accountability and the government.\"\n\nSub-postmasters and mistresses celebrated the quashing of their convictions\n\nIn the report laid before Parliament, Sir Wyn said there was no \"valid legal reason\" why the government and Post Office \"cannot give effect to the commitments they which they have made\" in providing \"full and fair\" compensation.\n\nThe retired judge said it was his job to make sure ministers and Post Office executives \"made good on those promises\" made to provide compensation to legitimate claimants \"promptly\" and to make sure the amounts paid out was \"recognised to be full and fair\".\n\nSir Wyn has long held concerns about the slow progress of compensation for Post Office staff.\n\nBut the Post Office chief executive, Nick Read, told the BBC's World At One programme that the \"sheer scale\" of the miscarriage of justice had \"gone above and beyond anything that anybody could realistically expect\".\n\n\"It really is a huge apology from the Post Office. We are all in this together and we are all on the same side,\" he said, but he rejected claims the Post Office was deliberately delaying proceedings.\n\nSir Wyn said it had been 16 months since he first started to hear the experiences of sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses, which he said \"consisted of graphic descriptions of hardship and suffering\".\n\nThe former High Court judge there were 438 applications for compensation still to be resolved as of 27 April, which he said the Post Office had accepted were \"difficult to resolve\".\n\n\"I am left with the distinct impression that the most complex cases have not been addressed as speedily as might have been the case,\" he said.\n\nAs the Post Office scandal has developed, three different compensation schemes have been set up.\n\nBut Sir Wyn said he was \"sure\" that if the government and Post Office were devising a scheme to deliver compensation to all involved now, there would not be three of them.\n\nHe also warned there was a \"clear and real risk\" that final compensation payments under one scheme - the Group Litigation Order set up by the government last year - \"will not be delivered to each applicant\" by the 7 August 2024 deadline.\n\nHe set out a series of recommendations, one of which was for payments to be made after the deadline, which he described as an \"entirely artificial cut-off point\".\n\nKevin Hollinrake, the Post Office Minister appointed last autumn, said the government would review the report and respond in due course.\n\n\"It is vital that we establish the facts behind this scandal and learn the lessons so that something like this can never happen again,\" he said.\n\nThe new owner of Silicon Valley Bank's (SVB) US operations, First Citizens, is cutting around 500 roles held by former SVB workers, the BBC understands.\n\nTwo months ago, First Citizens bought the business after SVB's collapse.\n\nThe failure of SVB, along with two other US banks, triggered fears of a more widespread banking crisis, which forced authorities to step in.\n\nSVB's business in the UK was bought in March by London-headquartered banking giant HSBC for a nominal \u00a31 ($1.25).\n\nIn an email seen by the BBC, First Citizens' chief executive Frank Holding highlighted the problems faced by SVB earlier this year and said the cuts will affect: \"select SVB corporate functions and do not include any personnel in client-facing positions.\"\n\n\"The team in India that supports SVB is not impacted by the changes,\" he added.\n\nThe BBC understands that the job cuts amount to around 3% of the company's total workforce.\n\nThe story was first reported by US-based news website Axios.\n\nFirst Citizens is based in Raleigh, in the US state of North Carolina and calls itself America's biggest family-controlled bank. It has been one of the largest buyers of troubled banks in recent years.\n\nUnder the deal, all 17 former SVB branches opened under the First Citizens brand.\n\nIn the UK, HSBC bought SVB's British operations in a deal led by the government and the Bank of England. Earlier this month, HSBC said its profits had got a $1.5bn boost from the takeover.\n\nAlso this month, Greg Becker, the former boss of SVB, apologised during a Congressional testimony, blaming rising interest rates and mounting withdrawals by customers as key causes of the bank's collapse.\n\nInterest rates were cut sharply during the 2008 global financial crisis and again during the Covid pandemic as central banks around the world sought to encourage economic growth.\n\nBut rates have been rising over the past year as central banks try to", "here'.\n\n\"I'm a passive dude, but when it comes to my music and my business, I'm serious about it and I'm competitive, so I wanted to be the first to go and do my own thing. That was the reason.\"\n\nThe star added that there were underlying tensions after the band had endured five years of intense fame and scrutiny following their debut on X Factor.\n\n\"There was obviously underlying issues within our friendships, too. We'd got sick of each other if I'm being completely honest.\"\n\nHowever, he said time had given him more perspective on his boy band days.\n\n\"We were close, you know?\" he said of the group. \"We'd done crazy things with each other that nobody else in the world will ever understand and I look back on it now in a much fonder light than I would have [when] I'd just left.\n\n\"There were great experiences, I had great times with them, but we'd just run our course.\"\n\nThe star was speaking ahead of the release of his comeback single Love Like This on 21 July.\n\nOne Direction in 2011 (L-R): Niall Horan, Harry Styles, Liam Payne, Zayn Malik and Louis Tomlinson\n\nIn the hour-long interview, he also told podcast host Alex Cooper about his struggles with anxiety, his love of cooking and his large collection of pets, including three dogs, three cats, three turtles and six chickens.\n\nHe laughed off his portrayal as \"the moody one\" in One Direction, saying it was \"just a marketing scheme\", and compared the band's public personas to \"the Teletubbies and the Spice Girls\".\n\nAnd he said he had been working to overcome the anxiety that has largely stopped him from performing since he left the band.\n\n\"As a young kid, I loved being on stage and I loved performing. When it became a thing that had a lot of weight behind it, in terms of people watching and stuff, then you're going to have natural feelings of anxiety. It's not a natural thing to do. I had to learn to adjust.\"\n\nThe star also addressed the 2021 incident in which he was accused of harassing his ex-girlfriend, the supermodel Gigi Hadid, and her mother Yolanda.\n\nThe star pleaded no contest to four charges of harassment following a family argument, in which he was alleged to have grabbed and shoved Yolanda.\n\nHe later issued a statement in which he denied hitting the elder Hadid (no charges were filed relating to this accusation) and said he had agreed not to contest the harassment charges so he could concentrate on raising his daughter, Khai, with his ex-partner.\n\n\"I just didn't want to bring attention to anything,\" the star said, emphasising his desire for privacy.\n\n\"I just wasn't trying to get into a negative back and forth with her [Yolanda], or any sort of narrative online where my daughter was going to look back and read that. There was no point.\n\n\"I believe I dealt with it in the best way, an amicable, respectful way, and that's all that needs to be said.\"\n\nZayn also spoke about how becoming a father had changed his outlook on life.\n\n\"When I'm with her, I don't work at all,\" he said. \"I just spend a full day with her doing things that she wants to do, like painting, Play-Doh\u2026 go to the park, go to the theme park, go to the zoo.\n\n\"I feel like I've rekindled my own childhood through her, you know?\n\n\"I feel like we get to a certain point in adult life where everything's kind of vague and grey and boring, and she's brought that colour back for me.\"\n\nIt is now 100 days since Humza Yousaf was formally elected by the Scottish Parliament as the country's sixth first minister.\n\nThe SNP leader has faced a baptism of fire since then, with his predecessor Nicola Sturgeon being arrested and several of the party's key policies having to be ditched in the face of controversy.\n\nSo are the next 100 days likely to be any easier for Mr Yousaf?\n\nThere is no escaping the fact that Humza Yousaf landed his dream job at an intensely difficult moment for his party.\n\nThe mere fact of Nicola Sturgeon's rather abrupt departure had shaken the SNP.\n\nAnd that was before police moved to arrest the former first minister, as well as her husband and former chief executive, and the party's treasurer for good measure.\n\nAll three were released without charge pending further investigations, but the fact that those inquiries into the SNP's finances are continuing means a black cloud is still hanging over the party.\n\nIt was a cloud which seemed to follow Mr Yousaf around in his opening weeks as first minister.\n\nEvery time he gave a big speech or interview, it would be blown out of the news agenda by a fresh twist in the investigation.\n\nThat was a particular challenge for the man billed as the Sturgeon continuity candidate in the leadership race - which ended in an incredibly tight victory over Kate Forbes in the second round of counting.\n\nAnd on the surface, he has stuck by his predecessor through what she describes as a \"difficult\" and \"traumatic\" period.\n\nWhen asked if he would suspend her SNP membership while the probe continues, he refused - and volunteered that she was \"the most impressive politician in Europe\".\n\nMr Yousaf defeated Ash Regan (left) and Kate Forbes to become SNP leader after a vote of party members\n\nIn one sense Mr Yousaf may have tied his political fortunes to the fate of Ms Sturgeon.\n\nBut in parliament he has also moved to slash her policy platform to ribbons, in what he terms a \"fresh start for Scotland\".\n\nLegislation to set up a National Care Service has been delayed. The Deposit Return Scheme has been sent for recycling.\n\nA ban on alcohol advertising has been scotched; Highly Protected Marine Areas have sunk beneath the waves.\n\nIn quite a few of these cases, Mr Yousaf may have been left with little choice.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Five things to know about Scotland's new first minister Humza Yousaf\n\nQuestions abounded over how the care service would work and be paid for; the recycling plans were beset with issues including a stand-off with the UK government.\n\nThe no-fishing zones had prompted a backbench rebellion spearheaded by Ms Forbes and former minister Fergus Ewing, who acted out the fury of coastal communities by shredding a consultation document in the chamber.\n\nBut Mr Yousaf will also feel he has acted decisively to rip up the more controversial items left in his in-tray by Ms Sturgeon.\n\nComprehensive changes have been made to the government's agenda in a short space of time.\n\nHe has also moved to reset a number of relationships with groups which felt neglected by the previous administration.\n\nThe first was with business groups, in part via the reboot on alcohol advertising and recycling. There is talk of reforming business rates, and a \"new deal\" with the private sector.\n\nHe also signed a new pact with local government which is known as the Verity House Agreement.\n\nAlthough there is always furious spin around the figures, councils have borne the brunt of budget cuts in recent years.\n\nMr Yousaf has promised a new \"fiscal framework\" between town halls and the administration in Edinburgh, along with \"improved engagement on budgetary matters\".\n\nFine words - but they will need to be backed up with hard cash if that relationship is to truly improve.\n\nHumza Yousaf brought a range of new faces into his cabinet - but also retained some Sturgeon loyalists\n\nHas Mr Yousaf also reset relations between the SNP and its leadership?\n\nHe has certainly tried to run his government out of a bigger tent.\n\nMs Sturgeon was famous for keeping a very tight circle of advisors who micromanaged most aspects of policy.\n\nMr Yousaf meanwhile has actively sought to push decisions and responsibility out to his ministers.\n\nHis initial policy prospectus featured each cabinet secretary outlining their goals and duties in their own words, introduced with the words \"I commit that by 2026, I will have...\".\n\nThat may give them more autonomy to make decisions to deliver on these targets, but on the flip side it likely means they will have to carry the can for any issues in", "\"I was there when it happened,\" he said. \"So it will never leave me, ever... and to think that poor Olivia's family have got to go through what Rhys' family went through.\"\n\nLike other parents in Croxteth, the football coach said that he became very worried about his own son's safety after Rhys's death.\n\n\"I was frightened to let him out on his own - I used to start panicking if he was out for more than half an hour,\" he said.\n\nThere is a decidedly mixed picture when you examine the statistics.\n\nThe number of firearms offences in Merseyside fell from 29 per 100,000 people in 2007/08 to 15 in 2021/22.\n\nDuring the same period, London's rate dropped much more steeply, from 44 per 100,000 down to 12.\n\nThis meant Merseyside had a higher rate of firearms offences than the capital.\n\nFurthermore, the number of fatalities has not decreased - Rhys Jones was one of four gun crime victims in Merseyside in 2007.\n\nLast year there were five - Sam Rimmer, Ashley Dale, Jacqueline Rutter, Elle Edwards, and Olivia Pratt-Korbel.\n\nIn the intervening years an average of three people have been killed by guns in Merseyside, with 2014 being the only year without a single fatality.\n\nFor many years Mr Geoghegan also worked with young offenders who were in secure accommodation.\n\nDrawing upon that insight, he warned of a \"lost generation\" of children who are deeply involved in criminal activity.\n\nHe said: \"The lure of money through drugs, the lifestyle these kids see, the lifestyle these high-profile criminals have.\n\n\"I am sure he's going to choose a new BMW to drive round the streets before he takes up my job in a warehouse.\"\n\nOlivia died when Thomas Cashman opened fire after chasing another criminal into her house\n\nMerseyside Police said it was working \"relentlessly\" to reduce gun crime.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Chris Green said: \"We've got individuals who've got no regard for the rest of society, no regard for the consequences of their actions.\n\n\"They have got no moral compass.\"\n\nHe said his officers would be \"relentless, as we have been over the past 20 years, to make sure that we identify all those who are responsible, bring them to justice, and place them behind bars.\"\n\nSenior investigating officer Det Supt Mark Baker said along with Rhys's murder 15 years previously, the fatal shooting of Olivia would undoubtedly be seen as a \"watershed moment\".\n\nHe said Olivia had been \"cowering behind her mum. She was extremely frightened because she's heard gunshots and she was hiding behind her mum in her own house.\n\n\"And the gunman has gone into the house. He will have seen and - when he fired that fourth shot into the house with the bullet going through the door, through Cheryl Korbel's hand and into Olivia - he will have heard the screams and he's continued to carry on shooting inside the house.\n\n\"We were extremely shocked at that level of relentless, careless pursuit and total disregard for any other life.\"\n\nHis colleague Det Ch Supt Mark Kameen said extremely powerful weapons were still reaching Merseyside's criminals.\n\n\"Handguns are the weapon of choice,\" he said, \"but we are now seeing Skorpions coming into the force area.\n\n\"These sub-machine guns have a huge rate of fire, they're absolutely deadly.\"\n\nThe force has been piloting a new strategy - Clear, Hold, Build - which it believes is already yielding positive results.\n\nMr Green said: \"We have seen that work really, really successfully in places like Speke, Croxteth, Norris Green, and parts of Liverpool 8.\"\n\nMerseyside Police also supports 60 projects - covering education, training and employment - which try to steer young people away from crime by offering better alternatives.\n\nStephen Geoghegan was only yards away from Rhys Jones when he was shot\n\nBut Mr Geoghegan said there was not enough being done at an earlier age, starting at 10 or 11 years old, to both teach children about the negative effects of crime and violence, and the positive benefits of work and family.\n\nCurrent schemes designed to help young people in danger of being sucked into a life of crime are just not working, he said.\n\n\"There's a lot of programmes, but it's got to be the right people delivering the programmes and the right content,\" he said, warning of the consequences of inaction.\n\n\"Until that happens this is going to continue unfortunately.\n\n\"I don't think there's anyone who can put their hand on their heart and say this isn't going to happen again - you just know it is.\"\n\nPanorama reporter Bronagh Munro investigates how Liverpool came to dominate the UK drug market.\n\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

Mr Trump had not.\n\n\"The Department [of Justice] and the FBI failed to uphold their important mission of strict fidelity to the law,\" the report concluded.\n\nIn a statement, the FBI said it had \"already implemented dozens of corrective actions\".\n\n\"Had those reforms been in place in 2016, the missteps identified in the report could have been prevented,\" the statement added.\n\nSpecial Counsel John Durham was appointed by then Attorney General William Barr in 2019\n\nThe FBI investigation into alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, which was carried out by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, led to dozens of criminal charges against Trump campaign staff and associates for crimes including computer hacking and financial crimes.\n\nIt did not, however, find that the Trump campaign and Russia had conspired together to influence the election.\n\nWriting on his social media platform, Truth Social, Mr Trump said the Durham report showed that the \"American public was scammed\". He cited the report's conclusion that there had not been enough evidence to warrant a full investigation by the FBI. Mr Trump has long claimed that members of the \"Deep State\" are targeting him unfairly.\n\nLast year, Mr Trump said he believed the Durham report would provide evidence of \"really bad, evil, unlawful and unconstitutional\" activities and \"reveal corruption at a level never before seen in our country\".\n\nThe Durham report falls short of the blockbuster revelations and prosecutions that some Trump allies hoped for from the inquiry.\n\nThe four-year investigation has resulted in three prosecutions. They include an FBI attorney who pleaded guilty to altering evidence while applying for permission to eavesdrop on a former Trump campaign official.\n\nTwo other people were acquitted on charges of lying to the FBI.\n\nThe former president cited some court filings by the Durham team as part of a lawsuit he filed against Mrs Clinton and several other Democrats and government officials, alleging that they had plotted to undermine his 2016 presidential bid by spreading rumours about his campaign's ties to Russia.\n", "to send female astronauts to space have been scuppered by the lack of spacesuits in their size.\n\nA well-fitting suit is crucial to prevent excessive fatigue and at worst, physical harm.\n\nIn 2019 Nasa had planned to send an entirely female team of astronauts to complete a space walk from the International Space Station.\n\nBut just days before Anne McClain and Christina Koch were due to depart on the walk, Nasa realised they didn't have two spacesuits in the correct size for both women, and McClain had to be replaced by colleague Nick Hague.\n\nNasa now believes the new design will overcome these problems and meet some of the challenges posed by the Artemis III mission to the moon, due to lift off in 2025.\n\nAstronaut Anne McClain was replaced on an International Space Station walk in 2019 because of an ill-fitting spacesuit\n\nThe key requirement of a spacesuit is to provide oxygen at the right pressure to the astronauts which allow them to survive in the near-vacuum of space. This aspect requires careful design, as failure would see an astronaut's lungs rapidly expand causing death.\n\n\"We have a lot of tough requirements on this suit,\" said Lara Kearney, manager of Nasa's spacesuit and rovers team, at today's demonstration of the new design.\n\n\"The moon is a hostile place, and the south pole is really going to be a challenge. A lot of thermal requirements, we are looking for improved mobility so our astronauts can operate more efficiently.\"\n\nTexas-based company Axiom Space won a $228 million (\u00a3190m) contract last year to design the suits, and now six months later they've revealed the first prototype.\n\nIn contrast to previous suits, the new Axiom Extravehicular Mobility Unit (AxEMU) spacesuit, has joints stitched in to provide the astronauts with more flexibility. It also sports inbuilt lights in the helmet.\n\nThese features are crucial as the astronauts will be required to survey geology, retrieve samples, and collect other data to further our understanding of the Moon's south polar region.\n\nThe helmet also comes with an HD video camera to allow videos from the moon to be watched in high definition back on Earth.\n\nThe new space boots should be able to withstand the freezing temperatures that are found in the permanently shadowed regions of the lunar surface.\n\nChief Engineer Jim Stein shows the new suit off in a live demonstration\n\nThe suits will be made using advanced manufacturing methods including 3-D printers and laser cutters to ensure exact measurements.\n\nThe prototype is part of a $1bn investment by Nasa to get two flight-ready spacesuits in time for the Moon mission.\n\nIn 2021, the space agency revealed it had already spent $420m on spacesuit development internally but was struggling to see results, so took the decision to commission the private sector to continue the work.\n\nBuzz Aldrin on the Moon in 1969 wearing one of the original spacesuits\n\nMike Suffredini, Axiom Space president and CEO, said in a statement that: \"Axiom Space's Artemis III spacesuit will be ready to meet the complex challenges of the lunar south pole and help grow our understanding of the moon in order to enable a long-term presence there.\"\n\nThe spacesuits will undergo further testing at Nasa's Johnson Space Center's Neutral Buoyancy Lab over the next year, before Artemis III launches in 2025.\n\nLast updated on .From the section Tennis\n\nKatie Boulter will play Jodie Burrage in the Nottingham Open final - the first all-British WTA final since 1977.\n\nBoulter beat fellow Briton Heather Watson 6-4 7-5 in a rain-affected first semi-final, before Burrage then defeated France's Alize Cornet 7-5 7-5.\n\nIt will be a maiden WTA final for both players, with the position of British number one also on the line.\n\nIn the men's competition, Andy Murray beat Portugal's Nuno Borges to set up a final against France's Arthur Cazaux.\n\n\"I was not expecting this coming into this week but I'm very, very happy with my performance,\" said 24-year-old Burrage.\n\n\"Alize is not an easy opponent to put away, as it showed at the end.\n\n\"It's going to be an amazing day on Sunday and I'm really looking forward to it - what an amazing tournament for us.\"\n\nCornet, 33, is a former world number 11 and beat top seed and current world number eight Maria Sakkari of Greece in the last 16 on Wednesday.\n\nThe Frenchwoman led 2-0 against Burrage but the Briton recovered and then broke Cornet's serve in the 11th game before holding her serve to take the first set.\n\nThere were six breaks of serve in the opening eight games of the second set before Burrage again gained the crucial break late on to secure the win.\n\nBoulter and Burrage met in the final on the lower-ranked ITF Tour in Canberra, Australia, in January, with Boulter coming from a set down to gain a 3-6 6-3 6-2 victory.\n\nHowever, Sunday's match will be the first all-British WTA final since Sue Barker beat Virginia Wade in San Francisco, USA on 28 February, 1977.\n\nBoulter became British number one for the first time earlier this week, replacing the injured Emma Raducanu.\n\nIf Boulter wins on Sunday she will stay the top-ranked British player when the rankings are released on Monday, but she will lose that position to Burrage if her fellow Briton wins the Nottingham tournament.\n\nWatson, 31, has won four WTA titles in her career but none of them on grass and none of them in the United Kingdom, with her last WTA title being at the Mexican Open in February 2020.\n\nBoulter could not take a break-point chance in the opening game of the match, but did then break Watson's serve in the fifth game in the last point before a 90-minute rain delay.\n\nWhen play resumed, Watson immediately got the first set back on serve, only for Boulter, impressing with her powerful forehand shots, to regain the advantage in the ninth game before serving out the set.\n\nWatson led 3-0 in the second set, but Boulter fought back to win seven of the next nine games to move into the final.\n\n\"I've worked so hard for this and I'm just going to keep plugging away,\" said 26-year-old Boulter. \"Even if it's not my time, it's been a great week for me and I will keep working hard.\n\n\"It means so much to me, especially here. It was a really tough match and I just tried to put my heart on the line and managed to get through in the end.\n\n\"She [Watson] is an incredible player and I knew it would be a battle. I have so much time for her, she is an amazing girl.\"\n\nWatson still has a chance of picking up a trophy though as she and Harriet Dart, who lost to Boulter in the quarter-finals of the singles event on Friday, have reached the women's doubles final.\n\nDart and Boulter beat fellow Britons Alicia Barnett and Olivia Nicholls 6-4 6-4 to set up a final on Sunday against the pairing of Ulrikke Eikeri of Norway and Ingrid Neel of Estonia.\n\u2022 None Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone\n\nSpecialist coaching was delivered in more than 200 primary schools\n\nFunding for specialist sports coaching in primary schools will end, the Department of Education (DE) has said.\n\nThe school sports programme was delivered by coaches from the Irish Football Association (IFA) and Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA).\n\nIt was run in more than 200 schools each year by 22 coaches and cost about \u00a3500,000 a year.\n\nThe department has told the sports bodies \"no further funding is available\".\n\nIt said due to budget cuts \"difficult decisions have had to be made\" to halt funding to a number of third party organisations.\n\nIn a statement, the IFA and GAA said they and a number of assembly members (MLAs) have requested an urgent meeting with the department's permanent secretary about the decision to end the fund", "opening four games en route to taking the first set, Scotland's Murray found his level at the start of the second set and reeled off five successive games.\n\nPaul, a semi-finalist at this year's Australian Open, got on the board but Murray levelled the match on his first set point and picked up where he left off in the decider, immediately breaking his opponent's serve.\n\nHe missed out on the opportunity to go 3-0 up by failing to convert two break points, and later saw another go begging before he finally broke 25-year-old Paul again in what turned out to be the penultimate game, before serving out the match.\n\nVictory means Murray will rise to 42 in the world when the rankings are updated on Monday - his highest world ranking since May 2018.\n\nHis win over Paul marks his third victory over a top-20 player this year, after beating Matteo Berrettini in the first of his enthralling battles at the Australian Open in January, and Alexander Zverev in Doha in February.\n\nThe French Open, the second Grand Slam of the year, starts on 28 May with Murray aiming to play in it for only the second time since 2017.\n\u2022 None Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone\n\u2022 None Can you answer these game show questions?

With the Spanish football federation introducing a rule the following season that players must be Spanish, an aggrieved Athletic went one step further.\n\nThrough stubbornness and success, picking from a population of about three million has worked for more than a century - Athletic have never been relegated from Spain's top tier and trail only Real Madrid and Barcelona in terms of trophies won.\n\nCritics call it xenophobic or racist. Some cite the case of Miguel Jones, a Bilbao native born in Equatorial Guinea who trained with the club. Policy at the time, however, dictated players must be born locally, so Jones was let go and instead enjoyed a successful career at Atletico Madrid in the 1960s.\n\nJones himself dismissed claims of racism, citing white players who experienced the same fate, and celebrated Inaki's emergence before his death in 2020. Perhaps more poignant than a trophy, then, will be the Williams brothers' legacy.\n\n\"It has been very rewarding to see how Athletic has evolved across time,\" says Gaizka Atxa, the Mexico-born founder of a fans' group named after Fred Pentland, a legendary former English coach of the club.\n\n\"Athletic is a reflection of our society here and seeing the Williams brothers flourish means that any immigrant or son of immigrants has a decent opportunity to play for our club.\n\n\"That just opens wide possibilities as to what Athletic could become in the next few decades.\"\n\nHow long they will continue to flourish together is a topic of debate. Nico, who wears 'Williams Jr' on his back, is highly sought-after, notably from Chelsea, where his father once tore tickets.\n\nThe 21-year-old's individual goal against Atletico in December was one of six he has scored in 29 games for Athletic this season. He is also joint second in La Liga's assist standings.\n\n\"Inaki is helping Nico a lot in everything,\" says sporting director Gonzalez. \"Nico is a very good player, but he is very young and you can imagine a lot of noise around him with clubs, with agents. But Inaki is the best example of hard work.\"\n\nAthletic fans can reluctantly accept when a star player goes as long as they leave money - in the form of a fat transfer fee - on the table. Aymeric Laporte, a \u00a357m departure to Manchester City, for example. Nico's previous contract was due to expire in June 2024, but in December he signed an extension through to 2027, under his brother's guidance.\n\n\"Inaki, of course, was also in on these decisions with his family,\" says Gonzalez. \"They feel very well here in Bilbao. They believe in the project. They are very happy with the team, with the coach, with everything. They also have the love of the supporters.\n\n\"For sure, at another club Nico could have gone for free to a Champions League club, earning much more money or winning more titles. But in this moment he has the feeling he has to continue here and Inaki is a very important person for him to take the best decisions in his professional career.\"\n\nIn any case, Nico and Inaki have unfinished business in Bilbao, a cup final to win - for the fans, for the city, for the club, for Felix and Maria.\n\u2022 None 'I couldn't really speak about it' - a decision dividing the WSL\n\u2022 None The mind behind the 'Doped Games'\n\u2022 None 'I always knew I was different' - Greg Halford and autism\n\u2022 None 'There are photos of me that made me want to cry'\n\nThe house has been left uninhabitable after the blaze, which began at 02:45 BST\n\nBarking dogs alerted their owners to a fire that destroyed a house in the middle of the night.\n\nCrews from five stations were called to the detached house in Dunmow Road, Takeley, Essex, at about 02:45 BST.\n\nA neighbour who helped rescue horses from the property's stable said she was woken by an explosion and \"looked out the window to see a sea of orange\".\n\nStation manager Terry Maher said the fire started in an outbuilding before spreading to the roof of the house.\n\nStation manager Terry Maher said the owners were alerted to the fire by their Chihuahuas barking in the early hours\n\nThe neighbour said: \"It was about 02:45 BST and my first thought was a plane had come down - I was living here when the Korean plane came down in 1999 at nearby Stansted Airport - and then realised it was a house and my partner and I ran out to see if our neighbours were awake and to ring the fire service.\"\n\nShe found the couple in the garden with their two Chihuahuas.\n\nThree neighbours then helped the police lead three horses from the property's stables.\n\nOne of them said: \"It was absolutely terrifying - the stables had filled with smoke, the horses were terrified and we had to lead them through blowing smoke and blowing embers.\n\n\"They were really good in the circumstances, but they were obviously traumatised by what was going on as there were blue lights everywhere, there was the fire and it was dark.\n\n\"You're on autopilot then afterwards the shock hits you, but you can't leave a horse to die of smoke inhalation.\"\n\nFirefighters from Stansted, Newport, Harlow, Stansted Airport and Bishop's Stortford helped tackle the blaze\n\nThe neighbours, none of whom wished to be named, said the fire was still smouldering and \"the smoke is still horrendous\" and they have not had power since 06:00 BST.\n\nThey said they were relieved no one was harmed in the blaze at the property, which was rebuilt after a previous house fire in 2007.\n\nMr Maher said the firefighters \"worked incredibly hard\" with a limited water supply.\n\nThe house has been left uninhabitable and an investigation will be carried out to discover the cause of the blaze.\n\nDunmow Road remains closed and a diversion is in place.\n\nTwo neighbours and a police officer led three terrified horses from a smoke-filled stables, led by a third neighbour lighting the way with torches\n\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Total revenue increased by 24% from 2022 to a record-high \u00a3549.6m, with matchday income reaching a record \u00a3117.6m. But they reported a loss for the fourth successive year following the 2022 deficit of \u00a350.1m. Levy stressed the need to \"capitalise on our long-term potential\". \"To continue to invest in the teams and undertake future capital projects, the club requires a significant increase in its equity base,\" he said. \"The board and its advisors, Rothschild & Co, are in discussions with prospective investors. Any recommended investment proposal would require the support of the club's shareholders.\" Under Premier League profit and sustainability (PSR) regulations, clubs can lose a maximum of \u00a3105m over a three-season period, or \u00a335m per campaign, before facing sanctions. Tottenham's losses over the last three years are beyond that threshold at \u00a3220.7m, but the annual depreciation charge of \u00a372m, which refers to their stadium and other facilities, means they are not at risk of breaching PSR regulations. Everton and Nottingham Forest have already been punished with points deductions this campaign for breaking PSR rules, while Championship side Leicester were charged last month by the Premier League for allegedly breaking spending rules during their last three seasons in the top flight. \"The club remains fully compliant with the rules and is supportive of the enhancement of PSR to ensure the Premier League remains competitive and sustainable,\" Levy said. \"We have operated on a financially sustainable basis and can now optimise the true value of key assets, the unrivalled facilities at our multi-use stadium and our training campus. \"We expect commercial revenues to rise from third-party events, although this will not compensate for the lack of European football this season.\" After finishing fourth in 2021-22, Tottenham returned to the Champions League last season - reaching the last 16 - bringing in \u00a356.2m in Uefa prize money, compared to \u00a310.2m in the previous year's accounts when they suffered a group-stage exit from the Europa Conference League. They finished eighth in the Premier League in 2022-23 and are not involved in European football this term. Tottenham's accounts for 2022-23 showed operating expenses had risen by 21% from \u00a3403.4m to \u00a3487.9m, due to increased first-team costs and the hosting of multiple non-football events, such as NFL fixtures, boxing and music concerts. A \"significant and continued investment in the playing squad\" saw the wage bill rise by 20% to \u00a3251m. Levy also had a pay increase from \u00a33.2m to \u00a33.5m, while taking home a \u00a33m bonus. In March, Tottenham announced season ticket prices would increase by 6% for the 2024-25 season, with the most affordable adult season ticket costing \u00a3856, up from \u00a3807 this season. They are also removing the concession for new senior season ticket holders - those aged 65 and above - from 2025-26. The Tottenham Hotspur Supporters' Trust said the decision was \"unacceptable\" and \"cannot be justified\". Tottenham said the increase in season ticket prices is because they have only raised prices once in the past five years - by 1.5% - and there had been a \"significant increase in matchday costs\". The accounts do not mention how much it cost to dismiss manager Antonio Conte, who was relieved of his duties at the club in March 2023, with Ange Postecoglou appointed his permanent successor on 6 June after interim spells from Cristian Stellini and Ryan Mason. Spurs also saw talisman Harry Kane sold to Bayern Munich for 100m euros (\u00a386.4m) in August, but that deal fell outside of the financial window and will be included in the 2023-24 accounts. Likewise, the outlay for new additions Micky van de Ven and Brennan Johnson will feature in next year's accounts.\n\u2022 None Our coverage of Tottenham Hotspur is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment\n\u2022 None Everything Spurs - go straight to all the best content\n\nTwitter has experienced major problems with posting some images and links - the second time in a week it has suffered technical issues.\n\nClicking on links in posts resulted in users receiving an error message.\n\nTwitter said some parts of the service were not \"working as expected\" and blamed an internal change that \"had some unintended consequences\".\n\nIt later said \"things should now be working as normal.

The police also spotted a number of large dark stains on the floor in the main bedroom, which later turned out to be Holly's blood, Mr Aspden said.\n\nMetson told officers his wife had been abusive to him, showing them a bite mark on his forearm, and she had left home with a local mental health support group on 19 March.\n\nPolice subsequently found Metson had told lies to officers, who later returned to conduct a search of the flat.\n\n\"At one point Mr Metson joked she might be hiding under the bed,\" said Mr Aspden.\n\nThe following day a walker \"made a grim discovery\" when he noticed plastic bags floating in the River Witham at Bassingham, one of which contained a human hand, he said.\n\nPolice divers recovered 224 remains of Ms Bramley's body but some of her body parts were never recovered, the court heard.\n\nFlowers were left on Thurlby Bridge in Bassingham by Holly's friends and family\n\nMr Aspden said it was likely the 26-year-old was stabbed multiple times in the bedroom before being moved to the bathroom where she was dismembered. Her remains were then stored in the kitchen larder.\n\nHe said the bite mark on Metson's arm \"suggests she was being restrained in a headlock\".\n\nAfter murdering his wife, Metson withdrew \u00a350 from her bank account and searched on the internet with questions such as \"What benefits do I get if my wife has died\" and \"Can someone haunt me after they die\".\n\nCCTV footage played in court showed Ms Bramley was last seen alive returning to her flat on 17 March.\n\nFurther CCTV footage showed Metson wearing a rucksack and using the flat's lift to move bags from the 14th floor to the ground floor in the early hours of 25 March.\n\nCandles were lit last month in memory of Holly Bramley\n\nIn court, Ms Bramley's mother, Annette Bramley, addressed Metson directly, telling him he had condemned her family \"to a life sentence of grief\".\n\n\"The heinous way in which she was murdered and dismembered has left us in such unimaginable pain,\" she said.\n\nMrs Bramley said Metson's controlling and coercive behaviour had also left the family unable to see Holly in the years before her death.\n\nThe court heard Metson had previous convictions for offences against former partners in 2013, 2016 and 2017.", "\n\n\"We ask a lot of our Hart paramedics,\" he said. \"We can only do that if we give them the PPE to operate and the training.\"\n\nHazardous area response team members are trained to help with rescues as well as treat patients at the scene\n\nEvery seven weeks staff have four days of intensive training to keep on top of the skills needed for the extreme locations they work in and the medical skills required when they get there.\n\n\"If we don't expose them to the real thing, when they come to do it they're not going to have the confidence to achieve what we need them to do,\" said Giles.\n\nOne man died and three others were injured in the blast\n\n\"Prior to Hart we didn't have the capability to treat the patient where they fell.

They will no longer be able to receive referral fees paid by debt solution companies.\n\nFor some people, there is little or no chance of paying off debts, and so they may have to consider some form of personal insolvency.\n\nAn individual voluntary arrangement (IVA) - is an agreement with creditors to pay debt.\n\nThe individual agrees to make regular affordable payments to an insolvency practitioner, who will divide this money between creditors. At the end of an IVA any unsecured debt left is written off.\n\nDebt Relief Orders (DRO) freeze debt repayments and interest for 12 months if the money owed is less than \u00a330,000 and the individual does not own a property. In that time, creditors cannot recover their money without the court's permission. At the end of the 12 months the debt is written off.\n\nA typical IVA can cost anything up to \u00a33,600 over a customer's lifetime while DROs can be less than \u00a3100.\n\nThe regulator said this business model \"incentivises bad advice\" and meant that companies recommend options that make them more money, rather than what is in the customer's best interest.\n\nThe FCA said it had seen evidence of debt packagers appearing to manipulate customers' details so that they meet the criteria for IVAs and using persuasive language to promote products without explaining the risks involved.\n\nIn some of the worst cases identified, the FCA found evidence of customers in financial hardship who were recommended solutions which caused more problems.\n\nOne customer was recommended an IVA by a debt packager when a different solution would have been more suitable. This cost them an extra \u00a34,710 compared with a DRO and meant it would take five years longer to become debt free, the FCA said.\n\nMatthew Upton, acting executive director of advocacy and policy at Citizens Advice said: \"Inaccurate or misleading advice from providers promoting Individual Voluntary Agreements can push people further into hardship and further away from a lasting solution to their problems.\"\n\nHe called on the government to bring all pre-IVA advice under the regulation of the FCA, \"so that people can be sure it's the right solution for them\".\n\nSheldon Mills, executive director of consumers and competition at the FCA, said: \"Good quality debt advice is vital in helping people out of financial difficulty and poor advice can have a devastating impact on those who are already struggling.\"\n\nExisting debt packager firms will need to develop a new way of doing business by October this year or face regulatory action, the regulator said.\n\nThe ban comes into effect immediately for new entrants to the debt packager market.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThere have been violent scenes as Israeli police raided the al-Aqsa mosque in occupied East Jerusalem, saying \"agitators\" had barricaded themselves and worshippers inside.\n\nPalestinians said stun grenades and rubber bullets were used in the pre-dawn raid and that 50 people were hurt.\n\nPolice said stones were thrown and fireworks fired at them in the mosque.\n\nMilitants in the Gaza Strip later fired rockets at Israel and its military carried out air strikes in response.\n\nThe latest violence comes just ahead of an overlap between the Islamic holy month of Ramadan and the Jewish Passover holiday.\n\nThe al-Aqsa mosque, the third holiest site in Islam, is located on a hilltop complex known by Muslims as al-Haram al-Sharif (the Noble Sanctuary) and by Jews as the Temple Mount. Jews revere it as the location of two Biblical Temples and it is the holiest site in Judaism.\n\nOn Tuesday, Palestinians barricaded themselves in the mosque after the evening Ramadan prayer, amid reports that Jewish extremists wanted to try to sacrifice a goat at the site for Passover - as Jews did in Biblical times before the Romans destroyed their temple there. Israeli police and religious authorities have said they would not allow such an act to take place.\n\nIsraeli police said in a statement that \"several law-breaking youths and masked agitators\" fortified the mosque \"in order to disrupt public order and desecrate the mosque\".\n\n\"After many and prolonged attempts to get them out by talking to no avail, police forces were forced to enter the compound in order to get them out with the intentions to allow the Fajr [dawn] prayer and to prevent a violent disturbance,\" it added.\n\n\"When the police entered, stones were thrown at them and fireworks were fired from inside the mosque by a large group of agitators.\"\n\nOne officer was injured in the leg by a stone during the clashes, it said.\n\nVideo released by the police showed fireworks exploding and lighting up the prayer hall as heavily armed officers in riot gear moved in.\n\nOther footage posted on social media appeared to show an officer using a rifle butt and others using sticks to beat Palestinians on the floor amid shouts and screams.\n\nPictures of the aftermath showed overturned furniture and prayer mats scattered across the carpet.\n\nThe Palestinian presidency warned Israel that its actions could have \"dire consequences\"\n\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent reported that 50 Palestinians were injured. It also said Israeli forces prevented its medics from reaching the mosque, though this has not been confirmed.\n\nSome of the Palestinians still in Israeli custody are in a critical condition, according to their lawyer.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted that the police \"had to act to restore order\".\n\n\"Israel is committed to maintaining freedom of worship, free access to all religions and the status quo on the Temple Mount, and will not allow violent extremists to change this,\" he said.\n\nBut the Islamic Waqf, which administers the site, described the police's actions as a \"a flagrant violation of the identity and function of the mosque as a place of worship for Muslims alone\".\n\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's spokesman also condemned the raid, describing it as an attack on Muslim worshippers.\n\n\"We warn the Occupation [Israel] not to cross the red lines in the holy places, which will lead to the big explosion,\" Nabil Abu Rudeineh said.\n\nThe leader of the Palestinian Islamist militant group Hamas, which controls", "consumers\".\n\n\"The CAA has chosen to cut airport charges to their lowest real terms level in a decade at a time when airlines are making massive profits and Heathrow remains loss-making because of fewer passengers and higher financing costs,\" Heathrow said.\n\nThe airport said the regulator should be \"incentivising investment\" to rebuild aviation services following the heavy blows dealt to the industry during Covid.\n\nBut the CAA said its decision to introduce lower charges from 2024 recognised that passenger numbers were expected to return to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nIt said as well as benefitting travellers in terms of lower costs, the charges would also allow the airport to continue investing in its operations, including planned upgrades to its security scanners and a new baggage system in Terminal 2.\n\n\"Our priority in making this decision today is to ensure the travelling public can expect great value for money from using Heathrow in terms of having a consistently good quality of service, whilst paying no more than is needed for it,\" said Richard Moriarty, chief executive of the CAA.\n\nIn 2021, Heathrow was given permission to raise the passenger charge for airlines from \u00a319.60 to \u00a330.19 for the summer of 2022. The aim was to help it get through the pandemic.\n\nBut British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, two of Heathrow's largest airlines, have long complained that fees at the airport, the busiest airport in western Europe, are the highest in the world.\n\nShai Weiss, chief executive of Virgin Atlantic, said the the regulator had \"not gone far enough\" in lowering passenger charges or ensuring that a \"monopolistic Heathrow\" was fulfilling its statutory duty to protect consumers.\n\n\"Heathrow has abused its power throughout this process, peddling false narratives and flawed passenger forecasts in an attempt to win an economic argument,\" he added.\n\nLuis Gallego, chief executive of IAG, the parent company of British Airways, said \"high charges\" were \"designed to reward shareholders at the expense of customers\" and risked undermining the competitiveness of Heathrow.\n\nWillie Walsh, director-general of the International Air Transport Association, which represents airlines, said the regulator was \"hostage to Heathrow's pessimistic passenger outlook\", and added the decision still meant airlines and passengers would \"continue to pay one of the highest airport charges in the world\".\n\n\"Given that Heathrow have succeeded in securing this generous settlement, we'll be watching their performance this summer and beyond very closely. Any repeat of the failures we have seen over the past few years would be totally unacceptable,\" he added.\n\nLuggage piled up on some days last summer at Heathrow\n\nLast summer, many airports across the UK struggled to cope with demand for international travel returning, with flights delayed and cancelled due to staff shortages. Many workers in the travel industry lost their jobs at the start the of the pandemic.\n\nMr Moriarty said the CAA had \"considered the sharply differing views\" from Heathrow and the airlines about the level of fees.\n\n\"Understandably, their respective shareholder interests led the airport to argue for higher charges and the airlines to argue for lower charges,\" he added.\n\nBoth airlines and the airport have six weeks to appeal the decision.\n\nManager Carlo Ancelotti said Real Madrid are \"lucky\" to have the \"fantastic\" Jude Bellingham after the England midfielder impressed on debut in a 3-2 pre-season win against AC Milan in Los Angeles.\n\nIt was another Englishman, Fikayo Tomori, who got his name on the scoresheet, heading the opener for AC Milan, but two second-half goals from Federico Valverde and a superb winner from Vinicius Jr, who ran on to a sublime Luka Modric pass, sent the majority of fans in a 70,000 crowd at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena home happy.\n\nBellingham's 62-minute debut had flashes of his natural technique and confidence, twice bringing roars of approval from the crowd and then praise from his manager Ancelotti.\n\nIn the opening stages Bellingham went on a mazy run by the touchline, leaving a couple of Milan defenders in his wake.\n\nThen, as the opening period drew to a close, a brilliant first-time half-volleyed pass, blending dexterity and a sure touch in a crowded penalty area, almost put Brahim Diaz in on goal.\n\n\"It is rare to find player with this kind of quality,\" Ancelotti said. \"He is only 20, so he can improve. We are lucky to have him in our squad.\n\n\"He was fantastic. He has a lot of rhythm, moves well and has quality finding open spaces.\"\n\nReal paid Borussia Dortmund \u00a388m to sign Bellingham on a six-year contract. They can already be assured the 20-year-old is the real deal.\n\nBellingham eases his way into life at Real\n\nAt his public unveiling as a Real player last month, Bellingham said he liked the idea of being out of his \"comfort zone\".\n\nThere is no club in the world where the glare is quite as intense for quite as long.\n\nBut everything about Bellingham - from his solid family background and parental guidance, to the bravery of his move to Dortmund from Birmingham aged only 17, to his decision not to join any of the Premier League suitors this summer in favour of a switch to the Bernabeu - suggests that if anyone can deal with what lies ahead, it is Bellingham.\n\n\"Real Madrid is a big team with big pressure, but from what he did at Borussia Dortmund, he is ready to accept that,\" said football writer Joel Del Rio, who was covering the AC Milan game for Madrid-based newspaper Marca.\n\n\"He is a player who can do everything.\"\n\nWatching Bellingham in the build-up to the game and then the opening hour, before he was replaced with a congratulatory handshake from Ancelotti, was instructive.\n\nFirst of all, Ancelotti picked him at the tip of a diamond, which is the role he has earmarked for the Midlander.\n\nIt allowed Bellingham to ghost and glide into positions of space as Toni Kross, deployed in the sitting position at the base of that midfield, could dictate play.\n\nDespite his tender years and the elite trophy-winning environment he has joined, Bellingham is not scared to demand the ball. When he gets it, he rarely takes the easy option.\n\nAncelotti said: \"He is distinct from our other midfielders and he is going to help us a lot.\n\n\"He could play left or right to use his characteristics, but his best position is as a number 10, where he has more possibility to get near to the opposition goal.\"\n\nBellingham already seems to have a connection with former Manchester City forward Diaz.\n\nThe pair did the pre-match passing drill together and twice Bellingham almost set the 23-year-old up, first with a flicked pass with the outside of his right foot, which drew appeals for a penalty as Tomori slid in to block, then that beautifully delicate half-volley pass very few players can execute.\n\nTomori, 25, was in conversation with Bellingham after the game and told BBC Sport: \"He is so elegant and will be a really good player for them. He said he has gelled in well and a few of the guys speak English, which makes it easier for him.\n\n\"It is good to see so many English players move to different countries. I know the Premier League is big, but there is football beyond that.\"\n\nJudging by the names of the back of the Madrid shirts being worn at the Rose Bowl, Bellingham is not yet vying with Vinicius in terms of popularity.\n\nBut there were still plenty of number five shirts - most famously worn by Zinedine Zidane, now with Bellingham on the back - in the crowd.\n\nBellingham was showing signs of tiredness when his outing was brought to an end and, with matches against Barcelona and Juventus to come before Real return to Madrid, it will be interesting to see how much involvement he has against Manchester United - who were so keen to sign him before he went to Dortmund - in Houston on Wednesday.\n\nA weight loss jab that has gained popularity in the US has been approved for use by the NHS in England.\n\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) concluded semaglutide, marketed as Weg", ", most of whom are crossing Mexico in the hope of reaching the United States.\n\nMany of them have been camped out in cities on the US-Mexico border for weeks and sometimes months, awaiting the possible lifting of a Trump-era policy which allows US border officials to deny individuals entry to the US \"to prevent the spread of communicable diseases\".\n\nThe Biden Administration had moved to end the policy, which is known as Title 42, last year, but the US Supreme Court blocked the move at the end of December and it remains in place.\n\nHowever, many migrants from Central and South America, as well as from as far afield as Africa, continue to embark on long treks to the US-Mexico border in the hope of the restrictions being lifted.\n\nLast updated on .From the section European Football\n\nManchester United manager Erik ten Hag hailed goalscoring skipper Bruno Fernandes as the star man in his side's Europa League last-16 first-leg victory against Real Betis.\n\nFernandes had taken the brunt of huge criticism heaped on United following Sunday's record 7-0 Premier League humiliation at Liverpool.\n\nBut Ten Hag confirmed in the build-up the Portuguese would remain captain if Harry Maguire was not on the field - and Fernandes repaid that faith with an outstanding contribution to a much-needed win.\n\nIt included his eighth goal of the season as he headed home Luke Shaw's 58th-minute corner.\n\n\"He was the best player on the pitch,\" said Ten Hag. \"He played a little deeper role and he was brilliant, making the game from the back position, with a lot of good passes in between the lines. From there we created a lot of chances.\"\n\u2022 None Reaction from Old Trafford and Thursday's European action\n\nTen Hag accepted Fernandes was not perfect. A late tackle on Betis' former Manchester City goalkeeper Claudio Bravo brought the midfielder a yellow card and did not look good.\n\nBut the United boss admitted it is a fine line Fernandes has to tread.\n\n\"His passion is his strength,\" added Ten Hag. \"But sometimes he has to control that because when it's too much, it becomes a weakness. He knows that, but there are always small margins.\"\n\nFernandes ran away to celebrate his goal with his hands to his ears as the home fans chanted 'Bruno, Bruno' in his honour, showing they are behind him as well.\n\nMarcus Rashford, Antony and Wout Weghorst were also on the scoresheet as United put themselves in a strong position to reach the last eight when the tie is concluded in Seville next week.\n\nBut Ten Hag knows one win alone will not banish the memory of Sunday's annihilation at Anfield, especially as he had been irritated by some of his side's performances preceding it, including the Carabao Cup final victory against Newcastle.\n\n\"We don't ignore it,\" he said. \"We made mistakes and we got hammered. We showed complacency and you can never do that in top football.\n\n\"In the weeks before, I was not happy against Newcastle and the performance against Leicester in the first half, but sometimes you have to get the bad result where everyone opens their eyes.\"\n\nIn his programme notes, Ten Hag described the Anfield debacle as 'unacceptable' and said he had left his players in no doubt such performances would not be tolerated.\n\nAnd, in a move that smacked of the Dutchman applying collective responsibility for the loss rather than singling out individuals for blame, he named an unchanged line-up.\n\nFor half an hour, all went well.\n\nThe hosts dominated as Rashford drove home his 26th goal of a magnificent season in the sixth minute after Fernandes' cross had been diverted into his path.\n\nFurther chances were created - the issue was none of them went in.\n\nBravo twice denied Rashford, Fernandes had a shot blocked and Weghorst's near-post effort was deflected wide even though he didn't get a corner.\n\nBetis' form in La Liga, where they are fifth, suggested they were not as poor as it appeared and Ayoze Perez proved it when he drilled home a low shot from the angle of the penalty area.\n\nHad the on-loan Leicester City forward got a second after he was set up by Juanmi - gifted possession by David de Gea, who rolled a pass straight to him from inside his six-yard box - anxiety might have spread through home ranks.\n\nAs it was, Perez's deflected shot bounced back off a post and United survived - although question marks remain over keeper De Gea, whose contract expires in the summer.\n\nEven Betis coach Manuel Pellegrini, who barely said anything noteworthy to the media during his three years as Manchester City boss, couldn't resist a pre-match dig at United after their seven-goal defeat at Liverpool.\n\nAs the weeks pass, it will be interesting to see if any individual does pay a price for what unfolded in what many view as the Premier League's greatest rivalry.\n\nFor now though, it can be claimed normal service has resumed.\n\nAntony's superb curling shot restored the home side's advantage seven minutes after the restart and Weghorst found the net with a first-time strike eight minutes from time.\n\nThe key element of that late effort though was the contribution of Facundo Pellistri.\n\nGood enough to play all three games for Uruguay in Qatar at the World Cup, the 21-year-old was only making his fifth United appearance, all off the bench.\n\nBut Pellistri's role in Weghorst's second United goal suggests he will be called upon more often as the campaign reaches its crucial phase.\n\nIgnoring the safety-first option of a pass back to halfway, he took off on a run past the Betis defence to the byeline where he sent a cross back to Scott McTominay, whose effort was blocked and bounced kindly for Weghorst to finish.\n\u2022 None Offside, Manchester United.

Mr Hayes told the BBC he did not know what to feel as \"it has been so, so long\".\n\nThe Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), the body set up to investigate miscarriages of justice, has decided to refer his case back to the Court of Appeal.\n\nThe CCRC", "\n\n\"London, what a nice breeze you have,\" exclaims Ros\u00e9 during a brief pause, grateful at the chance to stay cool amid the non-stop action.\n\nThe middle section of the show lets each member show off their solo material, and reveal a bit more of their personality.\n\nJisoo is all doe-eyed and demure as she plays the sweet-hearted love song Flower; while Ros\u00e9, Blackpink's most gifted writer, shows off her pop nous with a medley of the hit songs Gone and On The Ground.\n\nJennie, fresh from her co-starring role in the HBO drama Idol, shines through a playful version of Solo; while Lisa, who best embodies the band's in-your-face attitude, rips through the hip-hop track Money, then starts voguing in the dance breakdown.\n\nThe only slight hiccup comes when air cannons shoot thousands of streamers into the air during Ros\u00e9's solo set, only for a gust of wind to blow them backwards into the stage, where they hang off the lighting rig for the rest of the night.\n\nShrugging off the hitch, the band reunite for a high-octane third act that includes the summer dance anthem Lovesick Girls and the insistently catchy Shut Down (which samples Paganini's second violin concerto, La Campanella, to great effect).\n\nBut the highlight is Tally, whose strident lyrics - \"No one's keeping tally, I do what I want with who I like\" - are an unusual affirmation of sexual liberation in the notoriously buttoned-up world of K-pop.\n\nRos\u00e9 introduces the song as being \"very special to us\", and the band drop their choreography to perform it side-by-side - like the Spice Girls doing 2 Become 1, only with more f-bombs.\n\nTheir undisguised affection suggests there's still life left in the band; despite speculation over whether they'll resign their seven-year contract with YG Entertainment, which is thought to expire next month.\n\nSome 65,000 fans watched the Hyde Park show on Sunday\n\nShould they take the opportunity to wrestle more control over their career, the edgier lyrical content of Tally feels like a signpost for where they want to go next.\n\nNot that any of those backstage machinations matter to the fans in the field, who holler out every word - even the Korean ones - as the show comes to an explosive finale with the gargantuan hooks of DDU-DU DDU-DU and the euphoric Forever Young.\n\n\"We definitely did not expect this much energy,\" declares Ros\u00e9, as she waves goodbye.\n\n\"I can't put it into words, but thank you so much for everyone who showed up today,\" adds Jennie.\n\nIt's worth pointing out that the Hyde Park gig involved a completely revamped setlist from Blackpink's current world tour, incorporating both new staging and choreography.\n\nAlthough the band previously delivered a version of the set when they played Coachella in April, they had to relearn all the changes while playing in Australia last week; and squeezed in a final dress rehearsal during soundcheck on Sunday morning, about 24 hours after flying into the UK from Incheon in South Korea.\n\nBut rather than letting jetlag get the better of them, onlookers said they were full of energy and perfectly locked in sync, performing as if they had a full audience in front of them.\n\n\"On any level, with any comparison, it's a spectacular, spectacular show,\" says Jim King, chief executive of European festivals at AEG Presents, who booked the band for Hyde Park.\n\n\"Playing Hyde Park or Coachella is very demanding on an artist, especially on a pop artist. And the level of detail in that show, combined with all the one-off elements, just shows how professional and talented they are.\"\n\nAnd while Blackpink are the first K-pop band to headline a UK festival, King, who is the head of European festivals for live entertainment giant AEG, says they won't be the last.\n\n\"This genre of music is only going to get bigger,\" he says. \"You've seen it today. There's great passion out there, even though many of these bands have never been to a greenfield festival before.\n\n\"I think that any resistance we may have felt before has been blown away by Blackpink - and that opens the door for many of their contemporaries to come through as well. \"\n\nThe oil painting which belongs to the National Gallery is on tour\n\nAn oil painting by one of England's most celebrated artists has been hung in an empty store at a shopping centre.\n\nThe Cornfield was painted by John Constable in 1826, five years after his The Hay Wain masterpiece, and depicts the Suffolk countryside in summer.\n\nOwned by the National Gallery, it is on display at the Viking Shopping Centre in Jarrow as part of the museum's tour.\n\nIt has attracted a number of art fans, among them James Hays from Gosforth who described it as \"real life\".\n\n\"I don't like modern art, I've tried to study it and make something of it and I can't - but this is looking at life, it's real,\" added Mr Hays.\n\nJames Hays is no fan of modern art but thought the painting was like \"looking at life\"\n\nThe work was painted in January to March in the artist's London studio. The lane winding into the cornfield is based on Fen Lane, where Constable had often walked as a boy from his own village of East Bergholt to Dedham, where he went to school.\n\nAlthough it was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1826, it failed to sell.\n\nIt was presented to the National Gallery in 1837 as a tribute to the artist after his death, by a committee of friends and admirers who eventually bought it.\n\nBernadette and Frank Amos did not have to travel far to see the picture in their local shopping centre, finding it in the vacant Bright House unit.\n\nMrs Amos said: \"I just love the countryside and the feeling it gives you of freedom, I just love the outdoors.\"\n\nExhibition manager Gracie Divall from the National Gallery said it was great to see people embracing the opportunity.\n\nShe said she had met people who had previously seen the painting in London and had taken the chance to see it on their \"doorstep\".\n\nJoe and Pam Stewart made the trip to Jarrow from Sunderland to see the painting close up\n\nPam Stewart, visiting with her husband Joe from Sunderland, said: \"He's done all of this from memory which is really clever. We all take photographs now and can look back at them but if you ever do paint you never get it quite right - but he's got it and it's fabulous.\"\n\nDavid Forbes from North Shields added: \"I saw it was coming on the news and the chance to see something as exquisite as this you can't pass that by. My favourite bit is the little lad drinking water with his head in the pool, it's amazing.\"\n\nThe painting can be viewed in the shopping centre each afternoon until Sunday.\n\nMr Forbes liked the detail in the artwork\n\nFollow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

That could include age verification.\n\nLucy Crompton-Reid, chief executive of Wikimedia UK, an independent charity affiliated with the foundation, warns some material on the site could trigger age verification.\n\n\"For example, educational text and images about sexuality could be misinterpreted as pornography,\" she said.\n\nBut Ms MacKinnon wrote: \"The Wikimedia Foundation will not be verifying the age of UK readers or contributors.\"\n\nAs well as requiring Wikipedia to gather data about its users, checking ages would also require a \"drastic overhaul\" to technical systems.\n\nIf a service does not comply with the bill, there can be serious consequences potentially including large fines, criminal sanctions for senior staff, or restricting access to a service in the UK.\n\nWikimedia UK fears that site could be blocked because of the Bill, and the risk that it will mandate age checks.\n\nIt was \"definitely possible that one of the most visited websites in the world - and a vital source of freely accessible knowledge and information for millions of people - won't be accessible to UK readers (let alone UK-based contributors)\", wrote Ms Crompton-Reid.\n\nThere are currently 6.6 million articles on Wikipedia, and she said it was \"impossible to imagine\" how it would cope with checking content to comply with the bill.\n\nShe added: \"Worldwide there are two edits per second across Wikipedia's 300-plus languages.\"\n\nThe foundation has previously said the bill would fundamentally change the way the site operated by forcing it to moderate articles rather than volunteers.\n\nIt wants the law to follow the EU Digital Services Act, which differentiates between centralised content moderation carried out by employees and the Wikipedia-style model by community volunteers.\n\nOn Tuesday, the House of Lords debated an amendment from Conservative peer Lord Moylan that would exempt services \"provided for the public benefit\", such as encyclopaedias, from the bill.\n\nHeritage Minister Lord Parkinson said he did not think this would be feasible, but added that Wikipedia was an example of how community moderation can be effective.\n\nHe said the bill did not say that every service needed to have age checks, and it was expected that \"only services which pose the highest risk to children will use age verification technologies\".\n\nMs Crompton-Reid told the BBC that while Lord Parkinson's remarks \"reassured\" her , the charity did not want to be relying on future goodwill and interpretation of legislation.\n\nIt would continue to urge that protections to community moderation were in the bill through measures such as an exception for public benefit websites like Wikipedia, she said.\n\nA government spokesperson told the BBC the bill had been \"designed to strike the balance between tackling harm without imposing unnecessary burdens on low-risk tech companies\".\n\nCommunications watchdog Ofcom will enforce it and would \"focus on services where the risk of harm is highest\".\n\nThe government also believes it is unlikely Wikipedia would be classed as a category one service, those that would be subject to the bill's strictest rules.\n\nSouth Koreans will turn a year or two younger under a new law\n\nSouth Koreans have become a year or two younger as a new law aligns the nation's two traditional age-counting methods with international standards.\n\nThe law scraps one traditional system that deemed South Koreans one year old at birth, counting time in the womb.\n\nAnother counted everyone as ageing by a year every first day of January instead of on their birthdays.\n\nThe switch to age-counting based on birth date took effect on Wednesday.\n\nPresident Yoon Suk Yeol pushed strongly for the change when he ran for office last year. The traditional age-counting methods created \"unnecessary social and economic costs\", he said.\n\nFor instance, disputes have arisen over insurance pay-outs and determining eligibility for government assistance programmes.\n\nPreviously, the most widely used calculation method in Korea was the centuries-old \"Korean age\" system, in which a person turns one at birth and gains a year on 1 January. This means a baby born on 31 December will be two years old the next day.\n\nA separate \"counting age\" system, that was also traditionally used in the country, considers a person zero at birth and adds a year on 1 January.\n\nThis means that, for example, as of 28 June 2023, a person born on 29 June 2003 is 19 under the international system, 20 under the \"counting age\" system and 21 under the \"Korean age\"", "before the end, and right now we are no closer to knowing who will end up on top.\n\nAt the moment it is Liverpool who have the advantage, but only after a real battle to fight back and beat Brighton.\n\nIt was not a great team performance by Jurgen Klopp's side, but we've seen all season that it doesn't have to be when you have the firepower they do.\n\nLiverpool are relentless when they come forward, especially at Anfield, and they kept on creating chances - Alexis Mac Allister was magnificent in midfield.\n\nMohamed Salah had one of those days where he was shooting at every opportunity, but when myself, Gary Lineker and Glenn Murray were watching for MOTD2, all three of us as former strikers thought it was only a matter of time before one of them went in.\n\nThe sign of a great goalscorer is that you are never bothered when you are missing chances because you still believe you are going to get a goal.\n\nThat was the case with Salah. It took him nine attempts to score, but it turned out to be the winner and that's the one that matters.\n\u2022 None Our coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment\n\nLeading lawyers say they will refuse to prosecute climate protesters or represent new fossil fuel projects.\n\nMore than 120 lawyers have vowed to not act against activists from groups such as Extinction Rebellion and Just Stop Oil who are \"exercising their democratic right of peaceful protest\".\n\nThey have published a \"Declaration of Conscience\", and face the prospect of disciplinary action.\n\nThe chair of the Bar Council Nick Vineall KC said it was \"disappointing\".\n\nBarrister Paul Powlesland, who signed the declaration, said: \"We're refusing to advise fossil fuel companies on how to dig for new oil and gas, the same way we wouldn't advise a killer how to commit serial murders.\"\n\nThe group, who call themselves 'Lawyers Are Responsible', say they will withhold their services supporting new fossil fuel projects and any action against climate protesters who are \"exercising their democratic right of peaceful protest\".\n\nThey have called upon the government and their colleagues to \"act urgently to do whatever they can to address the causes and consequences of the climate and ecological crises and to advance a just transition to sustainability\".\n\nClimate groups like Just Stop Oil, Extinction Rebellion and Insulate Britain have made headlines in recent years through their tactics which include blocking motorways and gluing campaigners to buildings.\n\nThey now face the prospect of disciplinary action for breaching professional regulations such as the so-called 'cab rank rule', which requires lawyers to take on any case within their competence.\n\nThe declaration has been organised by climate group Plan B, which said some of the lawyers had self-reported to the Bar Standards Board.\n\nIn a statement, the charity said: \"This is understood to be the first time in legal history that barristers have engaged in a collective act of civil disobedience.\"\n\nJust Stop Oil activists blocking traffic in London in 2022\n\nThis comes a few days after the scientific body that advises the UN on rising temperatures released a new report saying clean energy and technology could be exploited to avoid the growing climate disaster.\n\nThe group of legal professionals includes some prominent members such as the chair of the British Institute of Human Rights Sir Geoffrey Bindman KC.\n\nFellow signatory Michael Mansfield KC said: \"I live on planet earth but I do not own it.\n\n\"I see myself as a custodian whose good fortune and responsibility is to represent its interests and those of fellow guardians.\"\n\nTim Crosland, the director of Plan B, called for an end to new fossil fuel developments.\n\nHe said \"behind every new oil and gas deal sits a lawyer getting rich\" while \"ordinary people of this country\" take a stand.\n\n\"The rule of law has been turned on its head. Lawyers are responsible. It's time to take a stand.\"\n\nIn a statement, Mr Vineall said: \"The cab rank rule prevents barristers from refusing work because they disagree with the actions or views of those seeking their services.\"\n\nThe rule \"promotes access to justice and promotes the rule of law\", he said, adding: \"It is disappointing that some lawyers apparently wish to remove these rights from people of whom they disapprove.\"\n\n\"I would be profoundly unhappy if a climate change activist accused of a public order offence were ever to be precluded from obtaining the services of the barrister of their choice because their chosen barrister happened to disapprove of the particular way in which they had been protesting,\" he said.\n\nPlan B said the declaration would be launched on 29 March outside the Royal Courts of Justice.\n\nMP and former solicitor general Robert Buckland said it was a \"very odd approach\" and \"not really consistent with the role of a lawyer.\"\n\n\"When lawyers start picking and choosing, in a way it undermines the independence of the legal profession\", he told the Daily Mail.\n\nHe added: \"There are plenty of people lawyers represent who are deeply unpleasant and deeply unpopular, such as rapists and paedophiles.\n\n\"But they are entitled to a fair trial.\"\n\nFormer Conservative minister Nadine Dorries has announced she is standing down as an MP.\n\nThe former culture secretary and close ally of Boris Johnson said she was standing down \"with immediate effect\" after \"something significant\" happened to change her mind.\n\nIt means there will be a by-election in her Mid Bedfordshire constituency, where she has a majority of 24,664.\n\nMs Dorries had already said she would not stand at the next general election.\n\nIt came ahead of the publication of Mr Johnson's resignation honours list.\n\nMs Dorries had been expected to be nominated for an honour, but she was not included on the list.\n\nEarlier on Friday, she told TalkTV: \"The last thing I would want to do is cause a by-election in my constituency.\"\n\n\"I don't believe I will be going into the House of Lords any time soon,\" she said, adding that she had not been contacted by anybody in No 10 about the honours list.\n\nHowever, after announcing she was standing down, she told the channel: \"The House of Lords thing was on the cards and it's gone back to HOLAC [the House of Lords Appointments Commission] to be vetted.\"\n\nThe advisory body is responsible for vetting nominations for peerages.\n\nAsked if she thought she should be in the House of Lords, Ms Dorries said it was \"very rare\" for someone from her background who was born into poverty to get a peerage.\n\nShe added that she was \"slightly disappointed\" but \"I don't think it was to be\".\n\nMs Dorries said \"something significant did happen to change my mind\" about remaining an MP, but she would not give further details.\n\nShe said she now had \"other priorities\", including her granddaughter and media career as a presenter on TalkTV and columnist for the Daily Mail.\n\nThe former culture secretary said she felt \"relief\", adding: \"I think I've been carrying a degree of guilt since I stood down as secretary of state. I think I possibly, maybe I should have stood down [as an MP] then.\"\n\nThe prime minister's press secretary said Mr Johnson's peerage list had been handed to HOLAC unaltered \"as is convention\", and HOLAC then passed back its approved list.\n\n\"He [Rishi Sunak] had no involvement or input into the approved list,\" she added.\n\nBorn in Liverpool in 1957, Ms Dorries worked as a nurse before becoming an MP in 2005.\n\nShe is also a successful author of romantic historical novels and hit the headlines in 2012 for taking part in ITV reality show I'm A Celebrity, which led to her suspension from the Conservative parliamentary party for six months.\n\nShe was a vocal critic of then-Prime Minister David Cameron and his Chancellor George Osborne, once describing them as \"a pair of posh boys who don't know the price of a pint of milk\".\n\nWhen Mr Johnson entered Downing Street he made her a health minister before appointing her as culture secretary in September 2021.\n\nShe left government last September when Mr Johnson stepped down as prime minister.\n\nSince then she has been a strong critic of current Prime Minister R", "ester or Nottingham Forest players on their way from East Midlands Airport to Blackpool, occasional social media posts have so far been the only insight to inform the debate around Premier League clubs flying small distances to matches instead of travelling by road or rail.\n\nNow, a study of 100 games played in the UK involving Premier League teams between 19 January and 19 March 2023 has given the first insight into the volume of the controversial journeys, some as short as 27 minutes.\n\nAnd for the first time the study also shows details of 'positioning' flights - where near-empty planes are flown to convenient airports, sometimes across the UK, in order to then transport players and staff to fixtures.\n\u2022 None The Sports Desk podcast: Should Premier League clubs stop flying to domestic games?\n\u2022 None Of those 81 flights, the breakdown was 59 flights for Premier League fixtures; 16 for FA Cup games and six for EFL Cup matches\n\u2022 None The shortest flight was just 27 77\n\u2022 None The average duration of these 81 flights was 42\n\nBBC Sport contacted all Premier League clubs with the flight information.\n\nIn addition to these 'player movement' flights, the research also suggested a significant number of connected 'positioning' flights. The study found:\n\u2022 37 of the 81 player flights had a flight marked as 'positioning' beforehand\n\u2022 None The average duration of the 37 'positioning' flights in the study was 42\n\nFlights produce greenhouse gases - mainly carbon dioxide (CO2) - from burning fuel. These contribute to global warming.\n\nEmissions per kilometre travelled are known to be significantly worse than any other form of transport, with short-haul flights the worst emitters, according to the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.\n\u2022 None Should clubs stop flying to domestic matches for environmental reasons?\n\u2022 None Find out more about sport and climate change\n\nWhat about these 'positioning' flights?\n\n'Positioning' flights are where the plane is getting into position to pick up its private charter passengers. They are normally what the aviation industry calls \"empty leg\" flights - so without passengers and therefore qualify as 'ghost' flights, a term increasingly being used to describe any flight with fewer than 10% passengers.\n\nBBC Sport contacted the airlines involved but received no confirmation as to the number of passengers on these flights.\n\nAs the Premier League's most southerly team, Bournemouth perhaps have more justification than others to fly to some games. They flew to Birmingham airport and back on the weekend of 17-18 March for their fixture with Aston Villa - a return journey totalling 73 minutes.\n\nBut the data pointed towards a further four 'positioning flights' connected to this trip - three of which were to or from Scotland - totalling an additional 201 minutes.\n\nIn addition to the 37 marked positioning flights, the BBC Sport research also observed instances of planes flying from one London airport to another in advance of a player flight - although not marked as 'positioning' flights. It is therefore possible the actual number could be higher.\n\u2022 None Green Football Weekend: What are clubs, players and fans doing?\n\nThe Premier League does not centrally mandate clubs' individual travel plans, but said in a statement to BBC Sport that it \"recognises the need to take action on climate change and is committed to reducing its overall climate impact\".\n\nThe statement added: \"Clubs have demonstrated their commitment to positive change in this area and continue to play an important role in raising awareness of the issue among fans, while also working on policies to improve environmental sustainability across their business operations.\"\n\nThose policies, the Premier League pointed out, include more sustainable fan travel initiatives, use of renewable energy and conservation projects.\n\nThe scale of the emissions\n\nThe Premier League pointed out that in the two-month period of the BBC Sport research, there were more than 74,000 domestic flights in the UK - putting the 81 Premier League club flights at less than 0.1% of that total.\n\nArsenal told BBC Sport that domestic flights of this type \"accounted for 0.25% of the club's total emissions for season 2021-22\".\n\nAn Arsenal spokesperson said: \"Domestic flights are sometimes a necessity based on player welfare and operational needs. The need to fly often depends on kick-off time, the time in between our matches and the reliability of alternative transport methods.\"\n\nThe biggest emissions are generated from stadiums on matchdays and fan travel - which is the sport's biggest climate footprint. The Premier League statement said its work will also include \"encouraging fans\" to \"consider how\" they can reduce their own carbon footprint.\n\nHowever, Dale Vince, chairman of League One side Forest Green, regarded as the world's most sustainable football team, called it \"shocking data in just two months\", adding: \"It's an illusion to think there is a gain for a flight of that duration, modern coaches are very comfortable and aren't going to impair the performance of the players over that short distance\"\n\nVince believes the Premier League and its clubs should lead the way.\n\nVince said: \"The carbon impact is one thing\u2026 I think the bigger impact is the emotional one, the intellectual one, you've got Premier League teams setting a very bad example for the rest of the country... when we are desperately in need of getting to net zero.\n\n\"This comes just days after the latest UN report that says we absolutely have just a few years left to act to avoid the worst of the climate crisis.\"\n\nThe Premier League has signed up to the UN Sport for Climate Action Framework and as a result is tasked with reaching net zero by 2040. That was in November 2021 but it is yet to confirm its plans.\n\nThe statement added: \"The Premier League is in the process of developing an environmental sustainability strategy, which will set out plans to deliver climate action. As part of this strategy, the league will continue to engage with and work alongside clubs and partners, to find practical ways of reducing football's environmental impact.\"\n\nWhat are the factors?\n\nPremier League clubs have been travelling this way for years - generally the quickest and most convenient option which clubs argue gives players and staff maximum time to prepare and recover between games, when the global fixture schedule is increasingly packed - something the clubs have no control over.\n\nIt is only recently, as players started to frequently post images on social media of these short domestic flights, that it attracted increased scrutiny in an era of climate impact awareness.\n\nAs this season shows, competition in the Premier League is as fierce as ever - just four points separates the bottom nine teams as they scramble to stay in the division and reap the multi-million pound rewards.\n\nWith such fine margins and enormous financial consequences, will clubs really risk a potential disadvantage by opting for slower but more environmentally friendly travel to high-stakes fixtures?\n\nMatt Konipinski is director of physio and performance at Rehab 4 Performance and has worked with Liverpool, Rangers and Barnsley football clubs. He disputes the performance argument, but does acknowledge that in a busy schedule time might be the overriding concern.\n\nHe said: \"I think physical condition is a consideration but I think the mode of travel doesn't necessarily have a huge amount of scientific support to justify one versus the other.\n\n\"We're talking about the options around whether a team might fly, whether a team may take the coach, whether a team may take the train and really the main emphasis around flying is speed and the top teams will prioritise speed over everything else.\"\n\nThere is no previous flight information to compare season with season. However, clubs have told BBC Sport that this season the cost of chartering planes has almost doubled as a result of both the rise in the price of fuel and decreased availability of planes after the pandemic and Brexit.\n\nWith pressure to spend money to attract better players, plus the increased focus on sustainability in the game, many clubs said the plane is the last resort - and that this 2022-23 season might actually see a reduction in flights from previous years. And that is despite running issues with England's rail network.\n\nChelsea manager Graham Potter gave an honest appraisal of the challenges facing football, saying: \"I think it's something we increasingly have to look at, because I think it's something we have to do better with.

Falls in the value of bonds held by banks are not necessarily a problem unless they are forced to sell them.\n\nAuthorities around the world have said they do not think the failures threaten widespread financial stability and need to distract from efforts to bring inflation under control.\n\nLast week, the European Central Bank raised its key interest rate by 0.5 percentage points.\n\nThe Bank of England is due to make its own interest rate decision on Thursday, a day after official figures showed that inflation unexpectedly shot up in February to 10.4%.\n\nFederal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said the Fed remained focused on its inflation fight. He described Silicon Valley bank as an \"outlier\" in an otherwise strong financial system.\n\nBut he acknowledged that the recent turmoil was likely to drag on growth, with the full impact still unclear.\n\nForecasts released by the bank show officials expect the economy to grow just 0.4% this year and 1.2% in 2024, a sharp slowdown from the norm - and less than officials projected in December.\n\nThe announcement from the Fed also toned down earlier statements which had said \"ongoing\" increases in interest rates would be needed in the months ahead.\n\nInstead, the Fed said: \"Some additional policy firming may be appropriate\".\n\nThe moves \"signal clearly that the Fed is nervous\", said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\n\nWednesday's rate rise is the ninth in a row by the Fed. It lifts its key interest rate to 4.75%-5%, up from near zero a year ago - the highest level since 2007.\n\nHigher interest rates mean the cost to buy a home, borrow to expand a business or take on other debt goes up.\n\nBy making such activity more expensive, the Fed expects demand to fall, cooling prices.\n\nThat has started to happen in the US housing market, where purchases have slowed sharply over the last year and the median sales price in February was lower than it was a year ago - the first such decline in more than a decade.\n\nBut overall the economy has held up better than expected and prices continue to climb faster than the 2% rate considered healthy.\n\nInflation, the rate at which prices climb, jumped 6% in the 12 months to February. The cost of some items, including food and airfare, is surging even faster.\n\nBefore the bank failures, Mr Powell had warned that officials might need to push interest rates higher than expected to bring the situation under control.\n\nThe bank projections show policymakers expect inflation to fall this year - but less than expected a few months ago.\n\nStill, they forecast interest rates of roughly 5.1% at the end of 2023 - unchanged since December - implying the Fed is poised to stop raising rates soon.\n\nMr Powell described the effect of the recent turmoil as the \"equivalent of a rate hike\".\n\nHe said the Fed may be able raise its key rate less aggressively, if the turmoil in the financial system prompts banks to limit lending, and the economy to slow more quickly.\n\nBut he repeated that the Fed would not shy away from its inflation fight.\n\n\"We have to bring down inflation down to 2%,\" he said. \"There are real costs to bringing it down to 2% but the costs of failing are much higher.\"\n\nParents rushed to a school in Tehran to pick up their children, as ambulances waited outside\n\nDozens of girls from 26 schools in Iran are reportedly being treated for poisoning at hospitals after another wave of apparent toxic gas attacks.\n\nMore than 1,000 students have been affected since November. They have suffered respiratory problems, nausea, dizziness and fatigue.\n\nMany Iranians suspect the poisonings are a deliberate attempt to force girls' schools to close.\n\nBut the government has not said whether it believes they are premeditated.\n\nInterior Minister Ahmad Vahidi, who has been tasked by the president with finding the \"root cause\" of the poisonings, on Wednesday dismissed as \"false\" a report by Fars news agency that three people had been arrested.\n\nHe also accused foreign-based media and \"mercenary groups\" of taking advantage of the situation to wage psychological war and worry people.\n\nSome pupils and parents suggested that schoolgirls may have been targeted for taking part in recent anti-government protests.\n\nAt least 26 schools in five cities across Iran were affected by the latest gas poisonings, local media and activists said.\n\nBBC Persian verified videos showing ambulances arriving at schools and students being treated in hospitals in the capital Tehran, the north-western city of Ardabil and the western city of Kermanshah.\n\nIn one from Tehransar, in western Tehran, several girls purportedly from 13 Aban School are seen lying on beds in a hospital ward and receiving oxygen.\n\nAnother video from the city's east shows girls sitting on the pavement outside a primary school. A mother is then seen rushing up to the gate and screaming: \"Where is my child?\" A man replies: \"They've poisoned the students with gas.\"\n\nPrimary schools have been among those targeted in the apparent attacks\n\nAuthorities are under increasing pressure from the public to stop the poisonings, which were initially concentrated in the Shia Muslim holy city of Qom, south of Te", "ing.\n\nThe department has already stopped a number of schemes to save money, including the school holiday food grant for children entitled to free school meals.\n\nThat came after funding for education was reduced in the 2023-24 Stormont budget.\n\nIn their letter announcing it was ending the funding for the scheme, the department said: \"Faced with this extremely challenging position the department has had no choice but to take a number of very difficult decisions.\"\n\nThe coaches from the IFA and GAA went into schools to provide extra PE classes.\n\nThey delivered lessons for pupils in athletics, dance, games and gymnastics as well as soccer and GAA, and provided advice to teachers.\n\nThe low level of physical activity among children and young people in Northern Ireland has previously been described as a \"major health concern\" in a Stormont report.\n\nIt said more than a quarter of children in Northern Ireland were classed as overweight or obese.\n\nA separate report from the Education and Training Inspectorate (ETI) said that about three-quarters of primary schools were not providing the recommended amount of PE.\n\nThe ETI had said that the IFA and GAA scheme gave teachers \"access to specialist local knowledge and skills which improve the quality of their planning for PE and extra-curricular physical activities\".\n\nConcerns have been raised about inactivity among children\n\nIn a joint statement to BBC News NI, the IFA and Ulster GAA said the school sports programme supported 900 teachers and 24,000 children, delivering more than 400 PE classes a week.\n\nIFA Foundation director James Thompson said the decision to axe the funding \"has been taken at a time when physical inactivity risks long-term harm to the physical and mental health of children\".\n\n\"Three quarters of primary schools are unable to provide the recommended two hours per week for PE,\" he said.\n\n\"If this was the case for any other statutory subject there would be government support rather than a reduction in provision.\n\n\"We are asking our MLAs to take all possible action to protect this vital programme and, most importantly, the health, wellbeing and resilience of children in Northern Ireland.\"\n\nUlster GAA director Eugene Young said ending the scheme \"would be a significant loss to our children and schools\".\n\n\"We cannot allow children to have decreased access to the statutory curriculum for PE and call on our political representatives to support the campaign to retain the wide-ranging benefits of this programme,\" he said.\n\nThomas McKee, who is principal of Our Lady's Primary School in Tullysaran, County Tyrone, said the coaches provided by the school sports programme were \"absolutely vital\" to the physical and emotional wellbeing of his pupils.\n\nIn a statement, the Department of Education said it \"recognises how disappointing this decision will be for everyone involved in the delivery of the programme and for the young people who have benefitted from it\".\n\nIt added: \"The education budget has been reduced by 2.5% and faces estimated pressures of \u00a3382m.\n\n\"While the department acknowledges the value that both organisations have added to support and enhance the delivery of the curriculum, difficult decisions have had to be made to cease funding to a number of third party organisations.\"\n\nLast updated on .From the section Rugby Union\n\nCoverage: Listen on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra; live text on BBC Sport website and app\n\nCaptain Owen Farrell will miss Saracens' Investec Champions Cup last-16 tie away at Bordeaux Begles because of a minor hamstring injury.\n\nThe fly-half, who will leave Saracens for Racing 92 at the end of the season, is replaced by Alex Goode.\n\nThe 32-year-old suffered the injury during their defeat by Northampton last Friday and will miss a \"few weeks\".\n\nEngland captain Jamie George takes over as skipper, with lock Maro Itoje back to start following the Six Nations.\n\nSaracens suffered a club record European defeat by Bordeaux during the pool stages, conceding nine tries in a 55-15 thrashing.\n\nThe three-time European Cup winners won two of their four pool games, with Bordeaux topping Pool 1.\n\n\"Once it gets to knockout rugby there is a different feel in the camp,\" Saracens number eight Tom Willis, who is named on the bench, told BBC Sport.\n\n\"Bordeaux have a very strong squad.

The country becomes just the second after the UK to receive Washington's elite nuclear propulsion technology.\n\nThe submarines will be able to operate further and faster than the country's existing diesel-engine fleet and Australia will also be able to carry out long-range strikes against enemies for the first time.\n\nUnder the deal, Australian navy sailors will be sent to US and UK submarine bases from this year to learn how to use the nuclear-powered submarines.\n\nFrom 2027, the US and UK will also base a small number of nuclear submarines in Perth, Western Australia, before Canberra will buy three US-model Virginia-class submarines in the early 2030s - with options to purchase two more.\n\nAfter that, the plan is to design and build an entirely new nuclear-powered submarine for the UK and Australian navies - a model that is being called SSN-AUKUS.\n\nThis attack craft will be built in Britain and Australia to a British design, but use technology from all three countries.\n\nThe US, Australia and UK will jointly build a new class of submarines\n\nPresident Biden said all three countries were committed to ensuring the Indo-Pacific region would remain free and open.\n\n\"Forging this new partnership, we're showing again how democracies can deliver our own security and prosperity... not just for us but for the entire world,\" he said.\n\nHe also pledged of $4.6bn (\u00a33.7bn) to expanding the US' submarine construction capacity and improving maintenance of its current nuclear-powered Virginia-class submarines.\n\nAustralia's PM said the plan - which will cost Canberra up to A$368bn (\u00a3201bn) over 30 years - marked the \"biggest single investment in Australia's defence capability in all of its history\".\n\nAnthony Albanese said building the submarines in Australian shipyards would also create thousands of local jobs.

I didn't think there was a club in the UK with the same headroom for growth as Wrexham.\"\n\nWrexham Association Football Club dates back to 1864; the team played in English football's second tier in the 1970s and even beat Portuguese giants Porto on one of their many European adventures.\n\nBut the club's decline and subsequent rise is something that even Hollywood's most ambitious scriptwriters might not have dreamt up.\n\nIt was just over 10 years ago when one die-hard fan offered the deeds of his house as supporters raised \u00a390,000 in just 24 hours so Wrexham could guarantee a bond to play in the league or face expulsion and probable oblivion.\n\nLifelong fan Richard Ulrich had just been made redundant from his job as contracts administrator but gave his pay-out and life savings of \u00a3500 to the club to help out.\n\nRichard Ulrich is proud he, like thousands of other Wrexham fans, helped play his part in saving his beloved club\n\n\"It was my birthday too but we thought this could be the end of the club and that made me feel numb,\" recalled Richard, 45.\n\n\"I had to do something to help as Wrexham AFC is a huge part of my life.\"\n\nThe club has also survived winding-up orders, multi-million pound debts and had a failed takeover bid by the star of fly-on-the-wall TV show Hotel Stephanie.\n\nWrexham's fans took over and began to stabilise the club in December 2011 - so when the happily ever after storyline could be written three years ago, the club was debt-free and its stadium and training ground were owned by a trusted landlord.\n\nThe fairytale finale began when the then Portsmouth chief executive Mark Catlin, who had also led a fan-run club, called Wrexham to advise of potential takeover interest.\n\nPompey had been bought by former Disney boss Michael Eisner, and Catlin called Wrexham to ask if the firm that had eased Portsmouth's buyout could talk to Wrexham's board.\n\n\"We'd had lots of takeover enquiries, ranging from a prince of some far-flung land, which felt very much like a scam, to other unsuitable local approaches,\" said Harris.", "computer.\"\n\nEmily Roberts, 25 has cerebral palsy and has worked as an admin assistant at Samantha K's Bridal & Occasion wear for six years.\n\n\"It's also important for disabled people to feel like they're people and feel like we can live equal lives,\" she said.\n\nEmily Roberts has worked at the bridal shop for six years but says her friends who also use wheelchairs have faced struggles when finding a job that suits their needs\n\n\"If the only thing stopping you from working is the working environment there is changes we need to make.\n\n\"My friend actually applied for a job but when she was offered the interview she went to the place where the interview was being held and there were steps to get in and they didn't have a ramp.\n\n\"She said to me, 'I can do the job I just can't get in to do it'.\"\n\nMs Roberts said making a workplace accessible for employees also makes it accessible for the general public.\n\n\"Visibility is so important for disabled people, we should be out and about in society we should be living normal lives but we should also feel like there are people out there that we can relate to and can relate to us.\"\n\nMs Greader, 25 from Llanrumney, Cardiff, also has postural tachycardia syndrome (pots).\n\nShe said: \"I've had quite a few breaks in my employment history including quite a large break when I had to give up my dream career that I worked very hard for.\"\n\nMs Greader said her employer/fianc\u00e9 understands \"some tasks take me longer due to my disabilities and processing\"\n\n\"I also had to give up the idea of ever working full time again and I was unsure if I'd ever manage part time,\" she said.\n\n\"Personally I am an unreliable employee, I wouldn't realistically manage a part time job if I didn't have the flexibility I do in my current job.\"\n\n\"He knows when to tell me to go home or not to come in because I'm pushing myself when I shouldn't.

What a person may receive from being able to work very very rarely makes up for what they are losing through benefits,\" she said.\n\nAccording to the latest Office for National Statistics data, the employment gap between disabled and non-disabled people in Wales is 32.3%, which is about 6% higher than the UK average.\n\nWrexham, Blaenau Gwent and Torfaen have the largest disability employment gap out of all Welsh local authority areas.\n\nDuring the UK government's Budget announcement in March, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said he wanted to get more disabled people into jobs by making it easier for them to find employment.\n\nMr Hunt said the work capability assessment (WCA), which decides how much a person's disability or illness limits their ability to work, will be scrapped.\n\nMr Hunt said this would allow benefits claimants to seek employment \"without fear of losing financial support\".\n\nA new support programme was also announced to support disabled people or those living with a long-term health condition. The UK government said the Universal Support scheme will fund up to 50,000 work placements each year.\n\nMegan Thomas of Disability Wales says the work capability assessment was \"not fit for purpose\"\n\nMegan Thomas from Disability Wales said scrapping the WCA was a \"positive step\" but argued the changes should go further.\n\n\"One of the things we see is a lot of barriers not just to accessing work but higher paid work,\" she said.\n\n\"That barrier is there often because of a myriad of reasons, whether it's access to education or accessing the workplace itself.\"\n\nBen Francis from the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said he would like to see greater support for disabled people to become self-employed.\n\n\"We would have preferred to have seen the government and employers coming together to form some sort of 'kick-start' scheme which would ultimately encourage disabled people into the workplace and one of those strands would be advocating self-employment as a viable route,\" Mr Francis said.\n\n\"An FSB report has found 25% of small business owners either have a disability or some form of illness, therefore a lot can be learned from them about the benefits of self-employment.\"\n\nMark Francois said the European Research Group (ERG) has not decided whether the vote against the Brexit deal\n\nA group of Eurosceptic Tory MPs has branded a significant part of the prime minister's new Brexit deal for Northern Ireland \"practically useless\".\n\nBut the MPs have not decided whether to reject the deal in a key vote on Wednesday.\n\nThe European Research Group (ERG) has published a critical legal assessment on what the PM has agreed.\n\nDowning Street has said there are no plans for substantial changes to the deal.\n\nThe deal - known as the Windsor Framework - was agreed by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and the European Union (EU) last month to revise the Brexit deal for Northern Ireland.\n\nIt replaces the Northern Ireland Protocol, which led to disagreements between the UK and EU over trade rules.\n\nThe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has been refusing to take part in the devolved government in Northern Ireland until its concerns over post-Brexit trading arrangements are resolved.\n\nMr Sunak hailed his deal as a \"decisive breakthrough\" and many Conservative MPs, including those who supported Brexit, gave their backing to the agreement.\n\nBut his solution has now been heavily criticised by the two groups he wanted to win over the most, the ERG and the DUP, which is the biggest unionist party in Northern Ireland.\n\nMr Sunak has been under pressure to secure their backing and restore power-sharing in Northern Ireland in time for the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement in April.\n\nUS President Joe Biden is expected to visit Northern Ireland next month to mark the agreement, which ended decades of conflict on the island.\n\nThe ERG's legal analysis may embolden Brexit-backing Conservative MPs to rebel against the government in Wednesday's vote on the Stormont brake aspect of the deal.\n\nThe Stormont brake mechanism aims to give the Northern Ireland Assembly a greater say on how EU laws apply to Northern Ireland.\n\nThe DUP has already said it will vote against the government's Brexit plans this week. But the government is still expected to win the vote with the support of Labour, who have backed the deal.\n\nLegal experts have advised the ERG that EU law will \"still be supreme\" in Northern Ireland under the deal.\n\nThe analysis is based on the verdict of a so-called \"star chamber\" of lawyers hired by the ERG to pore over the details of the deal.\n\nEven though the lawyers advised the ERG that the Stormont brake was \"practically useless\", the group has declined to say whether they will vote against Mr Sunak's deal or not.\n\nERG chairman Mark Francois told journalists that the \"group hasn't taken the decision yet\" and it would be \"down to individuals\".\n\nThe prime minister's official spokesman rejected the ERG's criticism of the Stormont brake mechanism, saying it \"addresses the democratic deficit and provides a clear democratic safeguard for the people of Northern Ireland\".\n\n\"It covers all the rules that could cause issues for Northern Ireland and is a matter for the UK alone, with no role for the European Union in deciding when the brake is used or agreeing whether the rule is disapplied,\" he added.\n\nMeanwhile, in Brussels, EU member states have approved key parts of the Windsor Framework.\n\nThey handed the European Commission - the EU's executive - a mandate to bring forward the relevant changes on customs, VAT and the Stormont brake.\n\nThe EU-UK body which oversees the Northern Ireland Brexit deal is due to meet on Friday to formally ratify the legal changes.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: How would the Stormont brake work?\n\nThe EU will have been anticipating the intervention of the ERG, which had a major influence on UK government policy during Brexit negotiations.\n\nThe group's influence has waned since former PM Boris Johnson won a landslide election victory in 2019, promising to \"get Brexit done\".\n\nSince Mr Sunak took office last year,", "\nHead of water and planning, Nathan Critchlow-Watton, said: \"With very little to no rainfall forecast across Scotland in the coming days, we expect ground conditions to continue getting drier and river flows to decrease or remain low.\n\n\"The next few weeks and months are a crucial time of year for water demand and we're urging abstractors to manage water wisely, minimising the need for restrictions to be imposed by Sepa.\"\n\nOverseas bricklayers and carpenters could be able to get work visas more easily in the UK after the government updated its shortage occupation list.\n\nThe list, which now also includes roofers and plasterers, highlights occupations that employers are struggling to fill.\n\nHowever, hospitality, which has had problems recruiting, was not included.\n\nThe change on construction workers is not expected to make a major difference to overall migration figures.\n\nGovernment advisors in the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) looked at 26 occupations in construction and hospitality, and recommended five for inclusion on the shortage occupations list.\n\nThe committee did not recommend any hospitality occupations be included, although it said Brexit and the pandemic had \"significant effects\" on both sectors.\n\nThe five occupations approved by the committee are:\n\nPeople on the shortage occupation list are able to apply for a skilled worker visa to come and work in the UK.\n\nThe construction and hospitality shortage review, published on the same day as the Budget, reveals vacancies have risen strongly in both hospitality and construction, relative to pre-pandemic levels\n\nFrom November 2022 to January 2023, compared with the period before the pandemic from January to March 2020, vacancies are 72% higher in hospitality and 65% higher in construction.\n\nThis compares to an increase of 42% in the overall economy.\n\nThe committee said its review was based on whether an occupation made up more than 0.5% of the sector workforce and earned below the current general threshold for migrants which stands at \u00a326,200.\n\nIt said it also considered the \"strategic importance of construction for the UK economy\" and how its workforce was likely to change in the next decade, with \"demand likely to increase markedly\".\n\nIt said overall employment in hospitality had recovered since a large fall during the pandemic and \"now comfortably\" exceeded pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThe committee said it did not recommend any of the hospitality occupations for the shortlist - including chefs, restaurant or bar managers - because \"the government was clear that such a recommendation should be exceptional and based on particularly strong evidence\".\n\n\"Perhaps inevitably, given the shortened time frame that stakeholders had to respond to us, we do not consider any of the evidence submitted sufficiently strong to justify a recommendation\", it said.\n\nLast October, Home Secretary Suella Braverman said she wanted to get net migration down into the tens of thousands.\n\nLast updated on .From the section Premier League\n\nTottenham manager Ange Postecoglou said he would like a \"joystick\" to control his players like in a video game after they were held by West Ham.\n\nThe Spurs boss was left frustrated as his side missed the chance to move into the Premier League top four with the draw at a rain-soaked London Stadium.\n\nBrennan Johnson's tap-in put them ahead after five minutes, but the Hammers levelled when Kurt Zouma headed home from a corner.\n\nBoth sides showed endeavour but lacked a cutting edge as the spoils were shared.\n\nDespite having 68% possession Spurs only had four shots on target, including Johnson's early opener and Destiny Udogie volleying straight at home goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski in second-half stoppage time.\n\nThey never looked likely to achieve the two-goal margin of victory they needed to overtake fourth-placed Aston Villa, who face Manchester City on Wednesday at Etihad Stadium.\n\nPostecoglou's side remain fifth, two points behind Villa, and the Australian said his team missed \"clarity of thought\" at times in attack.\n\u2022 None How did you rate West Ham's performance?

Despite the early goal conceded, his team delivered.\n\n\"I genuinely thought we didn't deserve to go behind,\" Moyes told TNT Sports. \"But the players did a good job.\n\n\"We had a threat and so did they - they are a good side and that's why they are challenging for the Champions League.

The result of that ballot will be announced on Monday.\n\nMs Slater, who is also co-leader of the party, said she wanted the Greens to stay in government and continue their work.\n\n\"But not at any cost,\" she added.\n\n\"We will only vote for the SNP's new leader to become first minister if they are committed to the politics of cooperation,\" she said.\n\n\"If they respect and share our values of equality and environmentalism. If they will prioritise climate justice. And if they agree that trans rights are human rights and that our trans siblings cannot be used as political fodder by Westminster.\n\n\"These are fundamental issues for us. They are non-negotiable. If the next first minister shares these values then we would not just remain in government. We should redouble our efforts to build a fairer, greener, and independent Scotland.\"\n\nShe said the party would put itself in the best position it could to \"deliver change\".\n\n\"If that is in opposition to an SNP government that has lost its way and abandoned its commitments to cooperation, equality and environmental progress then so be it,\" she added.\n\n\"With regret, that is where we would go.

Many of those convictions arose from guilty pleas, made under the threat of prosecution in the US, which the DoJ no longer views as sound.\n\nThe UK is now the only country where making or accepting the requests is viewed as criminal.

That you are not alone. And to remind myself as well.\"\n\nThere was support on Instagram, including from fellow performer Randy Rainbow, who is also on the cruise.

I did not do so as I was concerned that what was being asked of me was not within Parliamentary rules.\n\n\"I contacted the Commons Registrar and the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner who clarified these rules for me and had no further contact with the company. I did this before being made aware that the company did not exist and the individuals claiming to represent it were journalists.\"\n\nThe UK Parliament's code of conduct prohibits MPs from lobbying in return for payment.\n\nThe code of conduct says MPs may not speak in the House of Commons and make approaches to ministers in return for payment.\n\nA spokesperson for Chief Whip Simon Hart said: \"Following his self-referral to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards earlier this evening [Wednesday], Scott Benton has had the Conservative Party Whip suspended whilst an investigation is ongoing.\"\n\nThe Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards is an independent officer who investigates allegations that MPs have breached the code of conduct.\n\nFollowing investigation, if they think the allegation represents a breach of the code, they can put such cases before MPs sitting on the Committee on Standards, who can decide any sanctions.\n\nEarlier, Labour and the Liberal Democrats had urged Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to suspend Mr Benton from the parliamentary Conservative Party.\n\nLabour's shadow justice secretary Steve Reed told the BBC it was \"absolutely wrong for any MP to be trying to serve themselves rather than serve their constituents\".\n\nThe Liberal Democrats said if Mr Benton's whip was not removed by Mr Sunak, it would \"make a mockery of his claim to restore integrity\".\n\nThe rules around lobbying in Parliament were tightened up in an updated version of the code of conduct, which published in February following the controversy over paid advocacy work undertaken by former MP Owen Paterson.\n\nThe Times investigation comes after a similar sting operation set up by Led By Donkeys, a political campaign group.\n\nSenior MPs, including former cabinet ministers Matt Hancock and Kwasi Kwarteng, were filmed agreeing to work for a fake company for thousands of pounds a day. No rules were broken by the former ministers.\n\nThere has been a wider discussion about MPs having second jobs in recent years, and calls for reform of the rules after high profile cases involving parliamentarians conducting private business outside of their Commons duties.\n\nItaly has become the first Western country to block advanced chatbot ChatGPT.\n\nThe Italian data-protection authority said there were privacy concerns relating to the model, which was created by US start-up OpenAI and is backed by Microsoft.\n\nThe regulator said it would ban and investigate OpenAI \"with immediate effect\".\n\nOpenAI told the BBC it complied with privacy laws.\n\nMillions of people have used ChatGPT since it launched in November 2022.\n\nIt can answer questions using natural, human-like language and it can also mimic other writing styles, using the internet as it was in 2021 as its database.\n\nMicrosoft has spent billions of dollars on it and it was added to Bing last month.\n\nIt has also said that it will embed a version of the technology in its Office apps, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook.\n\nThere have been concerns over the potential risks of artificial intelligence (AI), including its threat to jobs and the spreading of misinformation and bias.\n\nEarlier this week key figures in tech, including Elon Musk, called for these types of AI systems to be suspended amid fears the race to develop them was out of control.\n\nThe Italian watchdog said that not only would it block OpenAI's chatbot but it would also investigate whether it complied with General Data Protection Regulation.\n\nGDPR governs the way in which we can use, process and store personal data.\n\nThe watchdog said on 20 March that the app had experienced a data breach involving user conversations and payment information.\n\nIt said there was no legal basis to justify \"the mass collection and storage of personal data for the purpose of 'training' the algorithms underlying the operation of the platform\".\n\nIt also said that since there was no way to verify the age of users, the app \"exposes minors to absolutely unsuitable answers compared to their degree of development and awareness\".\n\nBard, Google's rival artificial-intelligence chatbot, is now available, but only to specific users over the age of 18 - because of those same concerns.\n\nThe Italian data-protection authority said OpenAI had 20 days to say how it would address the watchdog's concerns, under penalty of a fine of \u20ac20 million ($21.7m) or up to 4% of annual revenues.\n\nElsewhere, the Irish data protection commission told the BBC it is following up with the Italian regulator to understand the basis for their action and \"will coordinate with all EU data protection authorities\" in connection to the ban.\n\nThe Information Commissioner's Office, the UK's independent data regulator, told the BBC it would \"support\" developments in AI but that it was also ready to \"challenge non-compliance\" with data protection laws.\n\nDan Morgan, from cybersecurity ratings provider SecurityScorecard said the ban shows the importance of regulatory compliance for companies operating in Europe.\n\n\"Businesses must prioritise the protection of personal data and comply with the stringent data protection regulations set by the EU - compliance with regulations is not an optional extra.\"\n\nConsumer advocacy group BEUC also called on EU and national authorities - including data-protection watchdogs - to investigate ChatGPT and similar chatbots, following the filing of a complaint in the US.\n\nAlthough the EU is currently working on the world's first legislation on AI, BEUC's concern is that it would take years before the AI Act could take effect, leaving consumers at risk of harm from a technology that is not sufficiently regulated.\n\nUrsula Pachl, deputy director general of BEUC, warned that society was \"currently not protected enough from the harm\" that AI can cause.\n\n\"There are serious concerns growing about how ChatGPT and similar chatbots might deceive and manipulate people. These AI systems need greater public scrutiny, and public authorities must reassert control over them,\" she said.\n\nChatGPT is already blocked in a number of countries, including China, Iran, North Korea and Russia.\n\nOpenAI told the BBC that it had disabled ChatGPT for users in Italy at the request of the Italian"]
