Everyone else in his troop lay dead or injured.\n\nSuffering from shell-shock and with one arm bandaged, the 37-year-old fired at the waves of Russian soldiers trying to storm his position. They didn't even try to take cover, but simply walked towards him across the open field.\n\nIt was clear Pavel wouldn't be able to hold the position for long, but he needed to buy time for a rescue team to arrive. His final action in life was to ensure his wounded comrades got to safety.\n\nThe Ukrainian military says Bakhmut is now the scene of many \"unprecedentedly bloody\" battles like this, where they now have to repel up to 50 attacks on their positions every day. Russia has concentrated massive forces in this area, and their brutal strategy of launching human wave attacks helps them to advance slowly - but at a very high cost.\n\nPavel was in charge of a forward observation group that consisted of six Ukrainian soldiers. On 17 February, shortly after the start of their watch, they came under heavy fire. A tank began hammering their position.\n\nUnlike relentless mortar rounds, the tank's aiming was chillingly accurate. Shells were landing a few metres from their trenches. Two soldiers were wounded and Pavel told them to go into a dugout. A combat medic went down to tend to their injuries and prepare them for an evacuation. Moments later, the wooden shelter was directly hit by a shell.\n\n\"There was a bright flash,\" one of the wounded soldiers with a callsign Tsygan told the BBC. \"I was thrown onto the logs with such force that it nearly crushed me. I couldn't understand whether I was dead or alive. Someone was shouting, it seemed the sound was coming from 100m away.\"\n\nI couldn't understand whether I was dead or alive\n\nIt was Pavel's voice who was checking on them. The other soldier was half-buried under dirt and logs. He was dead.\n\nTsygan could barely move and Pavel had to drag him up over the splintered logs that blocked the way. It was painfully slow to move Tsygan just a few metres away into a nearby trench. When the shelling paused briefly, Pavel went back trying to find others.\n\nTwo minesweepers arrived to clear the logs and find the bodies. But yet another shell hit the dug out, killing one of the men and injuring the other. The tank kept firing.\n\nAt that moment, Russian troops started storming their position. Pavel called for a support group to evacuate the wounded and rushed back to his Browning machine gun to stop the Russian infantry.\n\nThe 206th Battalion in which Pavel served had fought in the southern Kherson and north-eastern Kharkiv regions. But the battles over Bakhmut were very different from what they had seen before.\n\n\"The intensity of fighting to break through our positions was shocking,\" says Mykola Hlabets, platoon commander. \"Sometimes, [Russian soldiers] would get as close as 20 metres from us, crawling and moving under a treeline or across an open field. This is where we had our first gunfights at such proximity.\"\n\n\"They would just stand and walk towards our positions without any cover. We wiped out one group after another, but they kept coming.\"\n\nHlabets described them as a suicide squad.

That's one million more people than five years previously, NHS prescribing figures show.\n\nThe new figures on long-term use - for the period 2018-2022 - were provided to BBC Panorama by the NHS, following a Freedom of Information request. The data gives an overall picture but does not reflect the circumstances of individual patients, some of whom could be on antidepressants long-term for good reason.\n\nThe investigation also uncovered evidence that a leading drug company attempted 27 years ago to conceal possible withdrawal effects that one drug could cause.\n\nModern antidepressants - called SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Re-Uptake Inhibitors) - arrived from the late 1980s, including Prozac. They were quickly heralded as wonder drugs compared with earlier medications, some of which had serious side effects.\n\nThey were thought to treat depression by fixing an imbalance of the mood-regulating chemical serotonin in the brain. Researchers are now not clear how they work. One theory is that they simply change how you think or feel, rather than rectifying an underlying problem.\n\nThe NHS recommends antidepressants as a treatment for more severe depression. Talking therapy as well as exercise and lifestyle changes might be recommended instead of, or in combination with, the medication.\n\n\"Throughout my long and extensive career, I have seen people benefit from antidepressants,\" said Prof Wendy Burn, former president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists.\n\n\"I see them working in my clinical practice, I see lives being changed by them.\"\n\nBut she added: \"People are staying on antidepressants longer, and we don't really have long-term studies that support that.\"\n\nThere has long been a debate about how effective antidepressants are. The most comprehensive research, from the University of Oxford, suggests antidepressants do help some people, at least in the short-term.\n\nBut on average, their benefits are relatively modest, and the way people respond varies, with some not responding at all, according to the researcher who led the study.\n\nAnd there is some evidence to suggest that long-term antidepressant use may be linked to some health risks, such as heart problems and diabetes. It is also thought that long-term use may lead to a higher risk of withdrawal symptoms in some people.\n\nWithdrawal can happen when you stop a drug that your body has become used to.\n\nTaking that drug away too quickly, before the brain has had time to adjust, can lead to symptoms - including low mood and feelings of anxiety. Some symptoms overlap with the original condition the drug was prescribed for, which means the withdrawal can sometimes be confused with relapse.\n\nThe symptoms depend on the individual, which drug they were taking, and for how long. Many patients can stop taking antidepressants without experiencing any problems.\n\nIf you are affected by any of the issues in this article you", "gt": "can find details of organisations that can help via the BBC Action Line\n\nPanorama has uncovered evidence to suggest that one major drug company which manufactured SSRI antidepressants had become increasingly aware of a whole range of withdrawal symptoms from the mid-1990s, but was reluctant to share this information with the public and medicines regulators.\n\nA copy of a confidential 1996 memo from firm Pfizer - which originally sold sertraline, now the UK's most common antidepressant - shows employees discussing what"}, {"prompt": "bbc.co.uk.

Refugees and activists tell the BBC intimidating tactics are tearing communities apart.\n\n\"My dearest son,\" said Alim's mother as she flickered into view. \"I didn't think I'd see you before I died.\"\n\nAlim - not his real name - says he was overcome by the moment. The reunion over a video call was their first contact in six years, since he fled as a refugee to the UK.\n\nBut it was bittersweet: someone else was in control of the call. Like all Uyghurs - a mostly Muslim minority from north-western China - Alim's mother lives under intense surveillance and control. They could never call each other directly.\n\nInstead, a middleman phoned Alim and his mother from two separate mobiles. He held the phone screens to face each other, so the pair could see wobbly images of each other - and hear muffled sound from the speakers.\n\nAlim says they barely spoke, and spent most of the call in tears.\n\nHe doesn't know if the plain white wall he could see behind his mother was in her house in Xinjiang or an internment camp, where the Chinese government is alleged to have detained more than a million Uyghurs. China has long denied those charges.\n\nBut Alim says he knew this contact with his mother would come at a cost - because the man brokering the call was a Chinese police officer.\n\nUyghurs in China live under intense surveillance and more than a million have allegedly been detained in internment camps (file photo from 2019)\n\nWhen the officer called again, he asked Alim to attend meetings of Uyghur human rights activists, gather intelligence and pass it back to the Chinese state.\n\n\"Whenever there was an anti-China protest in London, they would call me and ask who would be attending,\" says Alim, who shared with the BBC recordings of the phone calls requesting he work as a spy.\n\nAlim was offered money, too, so he could try to befriend the leaders of campaign groups - many of them UK citizens - by taking them to restaurants and picking up the bill.\n\nThe officer suggested setting up a company as a front, in case suspicions were raised about his newfound wealth. Plenty of businesses had already been set up on behalf of others for that exact purpose, Alim was told.\n\nThe implied threat, that his family may come to harm if he refused, has left him in a vicious bind.\n\n\"They are using my family as hostages,\" Alim says. \"I am living in a dark moment.\"\n\nWatch more on BBC Newsnight on BBC Two at 22:30 on Monday 31 July, or catch up afterwards on BBC iPlayer\n\nThe tactics employed by governments to police their diasporas abroad are known as transnational repression.\n\nResearch suggests this particular kind - controlling access to family members in the home country through video calls, in exchange for compliance overseas - is commonly used by Chinese police.\n\nDr David Tobin at the University of Sheffield has conducted some of the most comprehensive research on the topic to date, with his colleague Nyrola Elim\u00e4. They have interviewed and surveyed more than 200 members of the Uyghur diaspora in several countries. He says all Uyghurs living outside China are victims of transnational repression.\n\n\"Family separation is the central tactic,\" he says. Even where phone calls are technically possible, relatives still living in China won't pick up, according to Dr Tobin. He says there is an assumption that calls will be monitored, and a fear that communicating freely will put them at risk.\n\nDr David Tobin says all Uyghurs living abroad are victims of transnational repression\n\nThis severing of family ties allows Chinese police to step in and offer tightly managed access - over video calls - as an incentive to comply, with the threat of repercussions for the family if they do not.\n\nIn the UK, Dr Tobin surveyed or interviewed 48 Uyghurs, from a population of about 400 people.

The charges cover the period of 2009-2018, since the 2008 takeover by the Abu Dhabi United Group, led by billionaire Sheikh Mansour, a member of the Abu Dhabi royal family.\n\nThey are accused of effectively falsifying their accounts and artificially inflating sponsorship and commercial deals over a number of years to allow them to spend more but stay within Uefa and Premier League rules.\n", "gt": "\nCity said they were \"surprised by the charges\" but welcomed the \"review of this matter by an independent commission to impartially consider\" their case, which City said was supported by a \"comprehensive body of irrefutable evidence\".\n\nCity, who have always denied financial wrongdoing, said they \"look forward to this matter being put to rest once and for all\".\n\nThe club has been referred to an independent commission, which can impose punishments ranging from a fine and points deduction to expulsion from the Premier League.

It's a hard thing to market.\"\n\nAs women executive producers, Ciarrocchi and Lawrence are still in the minority in Hollywood. A 2022 study from the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film showed that women comprised only 24% of directors, writers and producers in the top-grossing films, a decrease from 2021.\n\n\"I think there's a long, long way to go, but I do feel inspired and positive by the end product when you have more diversity in filmmaking,\" says Lawrence. \"It's what people want. The audiences want it.\"\n\nCiarrocchi adds: \"That's why we take the responsibility of Jen's platform so seriously as a woman who's giving opportunities to other women... to employ women, to tell women's stories, to always employ a diverse body of people.\"\n\n\"That's also because I am a woman,\" replies Lawrence.\n\n\"I'm lucky enough to not have the biased idea that women aren't as good at things!\"\n\nSaudi Arabia cut ties in 2016 after its embassy in Tehran was stormed\n\nMiddle East regional rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia have agreed to restore diplomatic relations, seven years after severing them in a bitter row.\n\nThe unexpected announcement came after four days of talks between officials from both sides in China.\n\nSaudi Arabia cut ties in January 2016 after demonstrators stormed its embassy in Tehran following Riyadh's execution of a prominent Shia Muslim cleric.\n\nTensions between the Sunni and Shia-led neighbours have since often been high.\n\nThey regard each other as a threatening power that seeks regional dominance. They also support rival sides across the Middle East, including in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq - and most overtly in Yemen.\n\nIran has supported Shia Houthi rebels who forced out the Saudi-backed government in 2014, while Saudi Arabia has led a devastating air campaign against the Houthis since the following year.\n\nSaudi Arabia has also accused Iran of helping the Houthis attack it.\n\nIn the most serious incident of its kind, drones and missiles struck major Saudi oil facilities in 2019, causing damage and disruption to production.

But as a deal with ministers was reached in England this week, the BBC can now reveal details of the secret and unprecedented talks.\n\nOn cold, frosty mornings on nurses' picket lines the rhetoric was fiery and noisy. Striking nurses condemned the government for failing to open pay talks. Ministers criticised walkouts affecting patients.\n\nBut behind the scenes it was a very different story. Secret contacts were being made between the two sides.\n\nFrom early January there were confidential approaches from an unofficial source to the Royal College of Nurses (RCN), the nurses' union, about the possibility of talks beginning in England. This involved putting out feelers to see what might bring the nurses' union to the table.\n\nStrikes by nurses and other health unions - representing paramedics, midwives and other NHS staff - had been triggered when ministers insisted on sticking to the recommendations of the independent pay review body (PRB). It had proposed average increases of 4%.\n\nThe RCN's original demand for a wage rise of 5% above inflation - equivalent at one point to 19% - was unaffordable, ministers said.\n\nThe government is ultimately responsible for setting NHS pay in England, funded by the Department of Health and Social Care. NHS Employers are involved in detailed negotiations.\n\nBut now these secret contacts had been made, it was not obvious to the RCN how closely they were linked to Downing Street or other parts of Whitehall.\n\nThe approaches seemed", "gt": "highly unorthodox. Usually it would be obvious whether ministers or officials were making a proposal.\n\nBut all became clear on 21 February with a call from Downing Street to the Royal College of Nursing. There was an invitation to talks which would include the idea of a one-off payment for the current financial year, a key demand of the nurses. The public announcement came as a big surprise even to some civil servants.\n\nThe prime minister was signalling a change of tack. Previously there had been denials that any more money was available.

The place is getting worse.\"\n\nThe message in February, which I received from a member of the maternity team, was stark but unsurprising. In a series of texts over the previous few months, the person had been getting increasingly concerned about what was happening at the East Kent trust.\n\nThe leadership is \"totally ineffective\" read one message. \"How long do we have to keep hearing this narrative - we accept bad things happened, we have learned and are putting it right. Nothing changes.\"\n\nFriday's report from the Care Quality Commission (CQC) is unfortunately just the latest marker in a near-decade of failure to improve maternity care at the trust. The revelation that inspectors considered closing the unit at the William Harvey Hospital in Ashford comes nine years after the trust's head of midwifery made a similar recommendation for the same reasons - that it was a danger to women and babies. The failure to act decisively then allowed many poor practices to continue.\n\nAn independent review published last October found that between 2009 and 2020, at least 45 babies may have survived with better care, while 12 other babies and 23 mothers wouldn't have suffered harm if they'd received good maternity care.\n\nPut simply, the trust has repeatedly failed to provide good care - and then failed to act when presented with evidence of poor care.\n\nConsider the extraordinary deaths of two new mothers from herpes at two of the trust's hospitals, just six weeks apart in 2018. The trust told the families there was no connection between the deaths. There were. A BBC investigation three years later found they'd been operated on by the same surgeon, and that the trust had failed to test him for herpes despite being told to do so.\n\nWhen those disclosures led to an inquest being ordered, the trust delayed its start for weeks by making last-minute legal arguments about wanting the coroner to put reporting restrictions on naming the surgeon, arguments it could have made months earlier, as it had been repeatedly discussed at previous hearings.\n\nWhen the inquest took evidence, a consultant microbiologist at the trust, Dr Sam Moses, was reprimanded for allegedly coaching a colleague in how to respond to answers while another clinician was sitting in the witness box.\n\nDr Moses also admitted that he hadn't told one family about the connections between the deaths, despite being in a meeting in which the mother of one of the women who had died asked explicitly about a link. He told the court that \"my role was to assist the trust. I didn't know whose responsibility it was to tell\" about the connection.\n\nAt the heart of the trust's problems, it seems, is a dysfunctional culture that stretches back almost a decade. In 2015, a review of its maternity services by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists found multiple problems, including consultants failing to carry out ward rounds, assess women or attend out-of-hours calls. The report was dismissed as \"a load of rubbish\" by the trust. A Maternity Improvement Plan, overseen by NHS England, was devised. However, by the end of 2019 fewer than a quarter of its action points had been completed.\n\nImproving care is virtually impossible if colleagues don't get along. An Employment Tribunal decision, published in February, concluded that a \"toxic and difficult working environment\" existed at William Harvey Hospital's maternity unit where people were \"shouted and sworn at over differences of professional opinion\".\n\nOlukemi Akinmeji, a black midwife, sued the trust for race discrimination and victimisation after colleagues \"joked\" that they should \"check their bags\" on her last day at the hospital. Ms Akinmeji, who worked at the William Harvey between 2018 and 2020, won her case.\n\nThe tribunal judgement described hearing evidence of a broken working environment and a foul-mouthed registrar that one former colleague described as \"totally unprofessional\". Since Ms Akinmeji left the trust, that doctor has been promoted to consultant, after apparently being told to cut out the swearing.\n\nThree former staff have told the BBC there is a cli", "gt": "que of senior midwives at the William Harvey, nicknamed by some as \"the untouchables\". They are described as \"watching each other's backs\", swearing, prone to talking disparagingly about both patients and colleagues. They've been working there for many years and are resistant to new working methods, and often, outsiders.\n\n\"It is the worst trust I've ever worked for,\" says one, \"there is so much unprofessional behaviour\". Another former staff member says,\"midwives often left the end of their shifts in tears,"}, {"prompt": "planned attack\" on UK soil.\n\nThe Met Police said last year that since the start of 2020, 15 plots to either kidnap or kill UK-based individuals perceived as enemies of the Iranian regime had been foiled.\n\nNearly 18 months ago, Iran International became one of the main providers of news during a wave of anti-government protests in Iran.\n\nPouria Zeraati is the television host of the Last Word program on Iran International\n\nWe are now ending our coverage of today's events in France after yesterday's knife attack at a playground in the eastern city of Annecy.\n\nTo read the latest on this story, head here.\n\nIf you need support after reading about these distressing events, you can find details of organisations which can help using BBC Action Line.\n\nToday's page was brought to you by our writers Laura Gozzi, Jack Burgess and Sam Hancock; the editors were Alexandra Fouch\u00e9, Alys Davies and James FitzGerald; and we had help from video producer Anna Boyd.\n\nEleanor Williams was found guilty of eight counts of perverting the course of justice\n\nThree men tried to take their own lives after being falsely accused of rape and trafficking, a court has heard.\n\nEleanor Williams accused the men of attacking her and posted on Facebook in May 2020 that she was the victim of an Asian grooming gang.\n\nThe 22-year-old of Barrow-in-Furness was found guilty of perverting the course of justice in January.\n\nDuring a sentencing hearing at Preston Crown Court, Mohammed Ramzan, said the lies had made his life \"hell on earth\".\n\nMr Ramzan said two weeks after he was arrested following Williams' claims, he attempted to take his own life.\n\nHe said: \"I still bear the scars to this day.\"\n\nMr Ramzan said his property had been damaged and his businesses had been \"ruined\" after he and his family were targeted \"in the most horrendous way\".\n\n\"I have had countless death threats made over social media from people all over the world because of what they thought I was involved in,\" he said.\n\nOne of the men she falsely accused, Jordan Trengove, spent 73 days in custody\n\nIn a statement read to the court, Jordan Trengove said the word \"rapist\" had been spray painted across his house.\n\nHe said he spent 73 days in prison, sharing a cell with a convicted sex offender, after he was charged as a result of Williams' claims.\n\nHe said: \"Things had calmed down a bit until the Facebook post in 2020.\n\n\"This made things even worse for me.

which are prescribed for depression, anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder and other conditions. That's one million more people than five years previously, NHS prescribing figures show.\n\nThe new figures on long-term use - for the period 2018-2022 - were provided to BBC Panorama by the NHS, following a Freedom of Information request. The data gives an overall picture but does not reflect the circumstances of individual patients, some of whom could be on antidepressants long-term for good reason.\n\nThe investigation also uncovered evidence that a leading drug company attempted 27 years ago to conceal possible withdrawal effects that one drug could cause.\n\nModern antidepressants - called SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Re-Uptake Inhibitors) - arrived from the late 1980s, including Prozac. They were quickly heralded as wonder drugs compared with earlier medications, some of which had serious side effects.\n\nThey were thought to treat depression by fixing an imbalance of the mood-regulating chemical serotonin in the brain. Researchers are now not clear how they work. One theory is that they simply change how you think or feel, rather than rectifying an underlying problem.\n\nThe NHS recommends antidepressants as a treatment for more severe depression. Talking therapy as well as exercise and lifestyle changes might be recommended instead of, or in combination with, the medication.\n\n\"Throughout my long and extensive career, I have seen people benefit from antidepressants,\" said Prof Wendy Burn, former president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists.\n\n\"I see them working in my clinical practice, I see lives being changed by them.\"\n\nBut she added: \"People are staying on antidepressants longer, and we don't really have long-term studies that support that.\"\n\nThere has long been a debate about how effective antidepressants are. The most comprehensive research, from the University of Oxford, suggests antidepressants do help some people, at least in the short-term.\n\nBut on average, their benefits are relatively modest, and the way people respond varies, with some not responding at all, according to the researcher who led the study.\n\nAnd there is some evidence to suggest that long-term antidepressant use may be linked to some health risks, such as heart problems and diabetes. It is also thought that long-term use may lead to a higher risk of withdrawal symptoms in some people.\n\nWithdrawal can happen when you stop a drug that your body has become used to.\n\nTaking that drug away too quickly, before the brain has had time to adjust, can lead to symptoms - including low mood and feelings of anxiety. Some symptoms overlap with the original condition the drug was prescribed for, which means the withdrawal can sometimes be confused with relapse.\n\nThe symptoms depend on the individual, which drug they were taking, and for how long.

widely used in the US and endorsed by many celebrities - are not a quick fix or a substitute for a healthy diet and exercise.\n\nIn trials, users often put weight back on after stopping treatment.\n\nSimilar injections, such as Ozempic and Mounjaro, which work in much the same way as Wegovy but are designed to treat diabetes, have not yet been approved for NHS use specifically for weight loss.\n\nNHS drugs watchdog, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), says patients can access Wegovy for a maximum of two years via specialist weight-management services.\n\nThese are largely hospital based, meaning only about 35,000 have access, but the government says tens of thousands more could be eligible - although the UK has no supply of the drug yet.\n\nThe new scheme will test how GPs could safely prescribe such drugs and the NHS provide support in the community or digitally, contributing to the government's wider ambition to reduce pressure on hospitals and give patients access to the care they need where it is most convenient for them.\n\nSemaglutide injections will be approved under NICE guidance\n\nMr Sunak said: \"Obesity puts huge pressure on the NHS.\n\n\"Using the latest drugs to support people to lose weight will be a game-changer by helping to tackle dangerous obesity-related health conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes and cancer.\"\n\nProfessor Kamila Hawthorne, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, welcomed the move but said there would need to be \"sufficient resource and funding to account for the increased workload\".\n\nShe added that there also needs to be enough of the drug available \"so as not to raise patients' expectations, as there may be a significant number of people who would benefit from it\".\n\nSpeaking to BBC Breakfast, Health Secretary Steve Barclay pointed to the impact obesity has on rates of cancer and diabetes.\n\nHe continued: \"We recognise it's often a real challenge for people to lose weight or keep the weight off, and that's why we're embracing the latest medication and making sure the NHS is at the front of the queue.\"\n\nMr Barclay also said there could be \"potential economic benefits\" from reducing the numbers of people absent from work because of health issues linked to obesity.\n\nThe government says obesity costs the NHS in England \u00a36.5 billion a year, with more than one million hospital admissions linked to obesity in 2019-20.\n\nMore than 12 million adults in England are obese, estimates suggest.\n\nAnd some High Street chemists are set to sell Wegovy to customers, prescribing and dispensing a weekly jab they can inject themselves using pre-filled pen devices.\n\nAs with any medication, there can be side-effects and risks.\n\nThe most common are nausea or an upset stomach, bloating and gas.\n\nNHS medical director Prof Sir Stephen Powis said: \"Pharmaceutical treatments offer a new way of helping people with obesity gain a healthier weight and this new pilot will help determine if these medicines can be used safely and effectively in non-hospital settings as well as a range of other interventions we have in place.\"\n\nHe said NHS England was negotiating with the manufacturer to secure long-term supplies at prices representing value for money for taxpayers.\n\nPupils were allowed to leave the school after being locked down for the morning\n\nA teenage boy is being questioned on suspicion of the attempted murder of a teacher who was stabbed at a school.\n\nThe male teacher was taken to hospital with a single wound after being attacked at", "gt": "Tewkesbury Academy in Gloucestershire just after 09:00 BST.\n\nFirearms officers arrested the suspect two hours later in Stoke Orchard, about three miles (4.8km) away, and a knife was seized.\n\nThe injured teacher was discharged from hospital on Monday evening.\n\nTewkesbury Academy has said it would reopen on Tuesday.\n\nGloucestershire police received a call from the ambulance service on Monday morning saying a teacher had been injured in a corridor at the school.\n"}, {"prompt": ", according to Cogat.\n\nBut Nate Mook, who was chief executive of WCK until 2022, warned that the longer-term consequences could be \"devastating\" for Gazans because \"we probably have not seen the last of the aid organisations to pull out\".\n\nZawar Ali of International Medical Corps told the BBC that it was reconsidering its safety protocols and whether to restrict its workers' movements.\n\nIt had already decided to relocate its field hospital from the north of Rafah to al-Mawasi, an area to the west which the Israeli military has declared \"humanitarian zone\" but has still carried out strikes on what it says are Hamas targets.\n\nDr Bashar Murad, the executive director of the Palestinian Red Crescent, said many of its paramedics were refusing to evacuate wounded and sick people from the north to the south in their ambulances due to the lack of safety guarantees, despite their protection under international law and co-ordination efforts by international organisations.\n\nAseel Baidoun of Medical Aid for Palestinians said it had not suspended operations after a strike in January damaged a residential compound in al-Mawasi that housed the British charity's local team and their families, injuring several people.

The agency has denied this, but in January it sacked nine of the 12 employees accused in an Israeli document of playing a part in the attacks.\n\nUNRWA called for a \"complete reversal in policies\" from Israel in response to Monday's strike, including lifting the ban on it delivering aid to northern Gaza.\n\nThe victim was found outside a house in Brentwick Gardens on Wednesday morning\n\nPolice say 10 people have been arrested on suspicion of murder after a man was fatally stabbed in London.\n\nOfficers said the man was found in the street with serious injuries in Brentwick Gardens, Brentford, at 05:15 BST and died at the scene.\n\nIt came after the force was alerted to reports of intruders at an address in the same street.\n\nSeven men and three women were subsequently detained and remain in custody.\n\nDet Supt Figo Forouzan, from Met Police, said: \"This is a truly shocking incident that will understandably cause the community concerns.\n\n\"I want to reassure the Hounslow residents that we have commenced a thorough investigation with the support of our homicide investigation team to ensure those responsible are brought to justice.\"\n\nThe force has appealed for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.\n\nThis is the fourth time in as many months that the prime minister has met President Biden.\n\nI have been in tow each time, and it's been fascinating to get a glimpse of their growing relationship.\n\nAnd quite some growing it's had to do.\n\nWhen Rishi Sunak became prime minister", "gt": ", President Biden, in congratulating him, managed to call him Rashee Sanook.\n\nNot long after that, Mr Sunak acknowledged to me that the UK's reputation had \"taken a bit of a knock,\" courtesy of the rolling political chaos of much of 2022.\n\nCore to his brand as prime minister is attempting to personify the opposite: hoping to be seen as dependable, believable, credible, trustworthy.\n\nLittle wonder, then, he ducked a question on the way here about what"}, {"prompt": "irds or a real big shift in numbers of the population.\n\n\"Rathlin's such a strategic and important nesting site for the seabirds because it's an off-shore island and in that case should be safe,\" he said.\n\nA team of people, like conservation scientist James Crymble, has spent the year surveying the island and training in preparation for what is a mammoth undertaking.\n\n\"Rathlin is actually quite a big island and it's quite a diverse island as well, there's lots and lots of different habitats, different terrain. The weather's pretty mean and it's going be a huge job,\" he said.\n\n\"The best way to do it is to lay out a grid across the whole island.\"\n\nThat entails laying a trap every 250m, the range an individual ferret will cover.\n\nEverywhere will need to be targeted, said James, including grassy ledges scattered down the cliffs - an undertaking that requires some extreme training.\n\n\"There'll be a huge amount, obviously abseiling, rope access skills, off-roading skills, all terrain vehicles, obviously first aid, things like that.\n\n\"By the end of it we'll be an elite force.\"\n\nHe added: \"And all of that will take place during winter. So absolutely the worst time of year, really, for us walking around.\"\n\nBut winter is the best time to target predators, who will be getting hungry as their prey migrates from the island.\n\nProtecting the seabird population is also about protecting people.\n\nThe economy on the island relies on thousands of visitors who come here every year for the wildlife.\n\nThe cliffs on Rathlin Island are thronged with sea birds\n\nSo while conservation like this - destroying one species to protect another - can be controversial, people on Rathlin are wholeheartedly behind the project.\n\n\"The island resident population have started to catch on to this,\" said Michael Cecil, chair of the Rathlin Development and Community Association.\n\n\"There's more and more interest from around the world, from scientific communities and other islands that are interested in similar things. So yeah, we're starting to pick up a bit of notice, more and more so and islanders are starting to talk about this project.\"\n\nSimilar projects have been undertaken on the Isles of Scilly, in the Shiants off Scotland and, most recently, on Gough Island in the south Atlantic\n\nBut this is the first time that ferrets will be targeted as part of a conservation effort like this.\n\n\"It's not cheap to get rid of these animals, but it's hugely beneficial for the wildlife here,\" said James.\n\n\"Nature is in crisis. We're looking at climate change. We're looking at overfishing at sea and this is the best way to really protect the island for future generations and just give them a bit of a buffer zone to face these overarching global problems.\"\n\nIt will take time for the populations to recover, but at the upside-down lighthouse that is home to Rathlin's Seabird Centre, Liam McFaul is hopeful.\n\n\"Seabirds are a very long-lived species and you're taking out the predators. You're not going to just immediately see next year lots and lots more birds, it'll take a number of years for them to build up.\n\n\"Rathlin is an internationally important mixed seabird colony. There's 150,000 guillemots and 22,000 razorbills, that's just literally breeding birds sitting on the cliffs.\n\n\"When you look on the sea, that's just peppered with birds and you look in the air, they're flying all over the place.\n\n\"So a census of these birds only takes consideration of what's sitting on eggs and on the cliffs. There's thousands and thousands more that's not counted.\n\n\"So lots and lots of monitoring will be done over the next few years, to see the changes from the predators being taken out.\"\n\nPC Bettley-Smith's lawyer said of the events: \"There's a huge difference between reading about it, and being there\"\n\nA PC's second set of blows to ex-footballer Dalian Atkinson on the night he was killed by her colleague was \"wholly unjustified\" and \"outrageous", "gt": "\", a disciplinary panel has heard.\n\nMary Ellen Bettley-Smith beat Mr Atkinson multiple times with her baton as he lay on the ground in 2016.\n\nA criminal retrial last year acquitted her of actual bodily harm.\n\nIn a separate police hearing, she denies excessive force amounting to gross misconduct.\n\nMr Atkinson died after being tasered and kicked in the head by PC Bettley-Smith's West Mercia Police colleague, and romantic partner, PC Benjamin Monk, who was"}, {"prompt": "the Glasgow home he shares with Ms Sturgeon early on the morning of 5 April.\n\nSeveral boxes of evidence were removed from the SNP's headquarters in Edinburgh\n\nPolice spent two days searching the house, with several boxes of evidence being removed.

He denied those allegations.\n\nIn April 2022, a number of women accused Mr Westwood, who also worked as a DJ on BBC Radio 1Xtra, of predatory and unwanted sexual behaviour and touching, in incidents between 1992 and 2017.\n\nThey also accused him of abusing his position in the music industry. Some of the women told BBC News they encountered Mr Westwood when they were under 18.

It has also ended its joint ventures with the state energy giant Gazprom.\n\nAnd it said it would start a \"phased withdrawal from Russian petroleum products, pipeline gas and LNG\". But it warned that it would be a \"complex challenge\".\n\nShell said last year it would close all its service stations in Russia\n\nSince then, it has kept taking cargoes of LNG from two Russian ports, the one at Yamal and one at Sakhalin in the far east.\n\nShell used to be a minority investor in the Sakhalin gas project, but abandoned that claim in September last year after the Russian government transferred its shares to a local business - and since then has taken no gas from Sakhalin.\n\nBut it still honours the contract with the Russian LNG company Novatek, which obliges it to buy 900,000 tonnes a year from Yamal until the 2030s, according to the Reuters news agency.\n\nNovatek is Russia's second biggest gas company, and the taxes it pays are a significant contributor to the Russian government's budget.\n\nOleg Ustenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian president, said: \"It is quite simple: by continuing to trade in Russian gas Shell is putting money into Putin's pockets and helping to fund Russia's brutal aggression against the people of Ukraine.\n\n\"The vast sums that Shell and the whole oil industry have made in Russia should be used to help fund the reconstruction of Ukraine, rather than lining the pockets of their shareholders.\"\n\nA spokesman for Shell said: \"Shell has stopped buying Russian LNG on the spot market, but still has some long-term contractual commitments. This is in full compliance with sanctions, applicable laws and regulations of the countries in which we operate.\n\n\"There is a dilemma between putting pressure on the Russian government over its atrocities in Ukraine and ensuring stable, secure energy supplies.

That's what we were wondering most of Monday - two days after a dramatic insurrection by the Wagner Group that saw a convoy of mercenary fighters headed to Moscow.\n\nA spokesman for Mr Putin announced a deal to end the Wagner mutiny late on Saturday. But when would the president himself comment on the controversial agreement?\n\nIt was controversial because the Wagner mercenaries had rebelled, seized military sites (with apparent ease) and then marched on Moscow; Russian air force pilots had been killed in the mutiny. Yet the Kremlin had agreed not to prosecute Wagner fighters or their leader Yevgeny Prigozhin in return for calling off the uprising.\n\nOver the last week, President Putin has made a series of unusual public appearances - all televised - in an apparent attempt to steady the ship.\n\nOn Monday we hear from Mr Prigozhin: an audio message posted online presenting his side of the story. He says his men headed to Moscow to \"hold to account\" those leaders he blamed for \"mistakes\" in the Ukraine war.\n\nThen late into the evening, an announcement is made. \"Standby: President Putin will address the nation.\" Now it feels like the Kremlin leader is playing catch-up.\n\nPutin appears on TV screens after 10pm. A late-night address from him is very unusual. Social media buzzes with rumours that this will be a speech that will \"decide the fate of Russia\". With trepidation we switch on Russian TV to hear the president speak.\n\nIt quickly becomes clear this address will not decide the country's fate. There are no major announcements. But the five-minute speech does provide clues to how the Kremlin is going to spin the dramatic events of the weekend to its benefit.\n\nPutin paints a picture of a Russia that has united to defeat the treachery of Wagner's leaders.\n\nHe tries to bring everyone on side: he thanks the Russian public, Russian officials, religious leaders, the Russian armed forces and his security services. He distinguishes between the leaders of the mutiny and regular Wagner fighters and commanders, whom he praises as patriots. Crucially, he presents himself as the man who averted major bloodshed.\n\n\"As soon as these events began to unfold,\" he says, \"in keeping with my direct instructions, steps were taken to avoid spilling blood\".\n\nRemember that controversy I was talking about? He doesn't address that. But, hey, Russia has stepped back from the brink. That's the main thing.\n\nOn Monday he was playing catch-up. By Tuesday morning it's full steam ahead to try to restore his authority.\n\nAt a hastily arranged event the Russian authorities are going heavy - very heavy - on the pomp and ceremony. Some 2,500 soldiers, Russian Guard and security officials are lined up on the Kremlin's Cathedral Square. This is the site of coronation (and funeral) processions of Russian tsars.\n\nCue Putin: To the presidential fanfare he descends the many steps of the Kremlin down onto the square (red carpet all the way, of course) and with a backdrop of the onion domes of Kremlin cathedrals the president - and commander-in-chief - delivers a speech to his troops.\n\nBut even before he", "gt": "starts to speak, the imagery says it all. It's all here in one place: the Orthodox Church, the Kremlin, the president and the army. It reminds me of the old Imperial Russian slogan: \"For faith, for the Tsar and the Fatherland.\"\n\nIn other words, the visual messaging here is all about presenting Russia as a country uniting behind Vladimir Putin.

Then they spend a couple of minutes together to talk to each other after the meeting, Then, all of a sudden, a scene of love becomes a scene of hate and death.\"\n\nThe fact that the killer was a former member of the Jehovah's Witness community here makes the tragedy particularly hard to bear.\n\nThere are about 4,000 Jehovah's Witnesses in and around Hamburg. The community is divided into smaller congregations, each with their own meeting place, known as a Kingdom Hall.\n\nDetectives investigating the mass shooting have said the killer left the Jehovah's Witnesses on terms which were \"not good\".\n\nMr Tsifidaris says he doesn't know why the man left, didn't know him personally, and appears reluctant to talk about him.\n\nThose who leave the Jehovah's Witnesses are often \"disassociated\" or cut off by most members of the community; a practice sometimes referred to as \"shunning\".\n\nThe police have revealed they recently received an anonymous letter, in which the author warned the attacker had a gun, was mentally unstable and harboured anger against religious groups, including the Jehovah's Witnesses.\n\n\"He left the community two years ago and now, all of a sudden, he's showing up and is acting against all the principles we stand for,\" says Mr Tsifidaris.\n\n\"What we know is that in the religious context, there is a community he knows, there is a community he was part of, so this is a community he focused his hate on.

It's very much not over - unlike the dispute with Network Rail, which saw signallers and maintenance staff accept a deal in March.\n\nThe dispute with the train operators always looked harder to resolve than Network Rail, because of the changes to working conditions involved - the strings attached, from the unions' perspective.\n\nThere's more misery for passengers on the way - hitting confidence in railway travel again - and workers will lose more pay.\n\nTrain companies' separate dispute with the train drivers' union Aslef has never looked close to a resolution, and today it announced three more strike dates.\n\nBut today's announcement from the RMT was a surprise, and makes it hard to see how their dispute goes from here.\n\nThe RMT's strikes have less impact than they did when Network Rail was involved too. But right now, it looks like there's still plenty of disruption ahead.\n\nThe government has a significant role - it holds the purse strings. It has shown no sign recently of being prepared to allow the train companies to put more money on the table.\n\nThe last rail strike on 18 March meant only 40% to 50% of trains could run as workers across 14 train operators walked out.\n\nThe ongoing dispute has affected services since June last year.\n\nHow are you affected by the latest round of rail strikes?

The government said its aim was to improve Covid surveillance of travellers arriving at London's main airport from China by helping to detect potential new variants.\n\nThe government said an average of 99 people per flight had been tested, totalling 3,374 passengers.\n\nDuring that period, 14 positive cases were identified, but none was deemed to be a variant of concern.\n\nThe DHSC said from Friday, 17 March \"passengers aged 18 or over travelling from mainland China and arriving at Heathrow Airport will no longer be invited to take a voluntary test on arrival\".\n\n\"The ending of this enhanced surveillance is in line with international partners such as the EU who are reducing border measures to monitor new variants from China\".\n\nOfficials said the government would maintain a range of contingency measures to \"enable detection, and swift and proportionate action, for potential new harmful variants\" should the need arise.\n\nLast December, ministers confirmed that passengers arriving to England from China would have to provide a negative Covid test before they boarded their flights.\n\nThe Chinese government was reporting about 5,000 cases a day at the time, but analysts said the numbers were vastly undercounted - and that the daily caseload could have been closer to one million.\n\nOther countries around the world such as the US, France India also implemented testing.\n\nWhile the decision only affected English airports, the government said that despite their being no direct flights from China to Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, that it was working with the devolved administrations to ensure the policy was applied UK-wide.\n\nIn January, China reopened its borders to international visitors for the first time since it im", "gt": "posed travel restrictions in March 2020 while officials declared later that month that the country's current wave of Covid-19 infections was \"coming to an end\".\n\nChina's National Health Commission stopped publishing data on Covid cases and deaths on 25 December after the relaxation of its zero-Covid policy and in February declared a \"decisive victory\" over the pandemic.\n\nWhen this cow ran onto an interstate, police in Michigan relied on a cowboy to lasso the suspect bovine.
