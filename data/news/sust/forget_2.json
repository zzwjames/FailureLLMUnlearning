["Google's parent company Alphabet is rolling out its artificial intelligence chatbot Bard in Europe and Brazil.\n\nIt is the product's biggest expansion since its March launch in the US and the UK and heats up the rivalry with Microsoft's ChatGPT.\n\nBoth are examples of generative AI that can respond to questions in a human-like way.\n\nBard's launch in the EU had been held up after the main data regulator in the bloc raised privacy concerns.\n\nThe Irish Data Protection Commission said that the tech giant had not provided enough information about how its generative AI tool protects Europeans' privacy to justify an EU launch.\n\nThe company said it has since met the watchdogs to reassure them on issues relating to transparency, choice and control.\n\nIn a briefing with journalists, Amar Subramanya, engineering vice president of Bard, added that users could opt out of their data being collected.\n\nMr Subramanya declined to comment on whether there were plans to develop a Bard app.\n\n\"Bard is an experiment,\" he said. \"We want to be bold and responsible.\"\n\nGoogle has also now added new features to Bard, which apply worldwide.\n\nThese include the ability for the chatbot to speak its answers back to you and for it to respond to prompts that also include images.\n\n\"Starting today, you can collaborate with Bard in over 40 languages, including Arabic, Chinese, German, Hindi and Spanish,\" Google senior product director Jack Krawczyk said in a blog post.\n\n\"Sometimes hearing something out loud can help you approach your idea in a different way. This is especially helpful if you want to hear the correct pronunciation of a word or listen to a poem or script.\"\n\nHe said users can now change the tone and style of Bard's responses to either simple, long, short, professional or casual.\n\nThey can also pin or rename conversations, export code to more places and use images in prompts.\n\nThe hype around the capabilities of generative AI has prompted global tech figures to call for a halt on their development.\n\nDepending on who you speak to, AI could either lead to the end of humanity or solve climate change, or both.\n\nOver the last six months companies have been investing billions with the hope of generating much more in advertising and cloud revenue.\n\nMistral AI, a start-up that was just a month old, picked up an \u00a386m round of seed funding to build and train large language models.\n\nThis week Elon Musk announced the formation of an AI start-up called xAI, with a team including several engineers that have worked at OpenAI and Google.\n\nMr Musk has previously stated he believes developments in AI should be paused and that the sector needs regulation.\n\nElsewhere American AI company Anthropic launched another rival chatbot to ChatGPT called Claude 2, which can summarise novel-sized blocks of text.\n\nClaude 2 is publicly available in the US and the UK and uses a safety method described by the company as \"Constitutional AI\", referring to a set of principles to make judgements about the text it is producing.\n\nNonetheless, novelty appeal in AI chatbots may be waning, with recent web user numbers showing that monthly traffic to ChatGPT's website and unique visitors declined for the first time in June.\n\nGoogle has also been hit by a fresh class action in the US over the alleged misuse of users' personal information to train Bard.\n\nThe complaint, filed in San Francisco federal court by eight individuals seeking to represent millions of internet users and copyright holders, said Google's unauthorised scraping of data from websites violated their privacy and property rights.\n\n\"Google does not own the internet, it does not own our creative works, it does not own our expressions of our personhood, pictures of our families and children, or anything else simply because we share it online,\" the plaintiffs' attorney Ryan Clarkson said in a statement.", "Emergency general surgery was moved from Daisy Hill in February 2022\n\nA shortage of consultants at Daisy Hill Hospital in Newry means delivering inpatient care in general medicine is at risk.\n\nThe Southern Health Trust said it was working with other trusts in Northern Ireland and the Department of Health \"to help us through this situation\".\n\nIt has also emerged that the hospital's stroke service is being withdrawn from 09:00 BST on 31 May.\n\nThat is because the hospital's one remaining specialist is leaving.\n\nThe trust said recruiting and retaining medical staff has been a major issue in the hospital in recent years.\n\n\"The pressures have now escalated with increasing reliance on medical locum cover and a number of consultant medical staff ending their tenure at the hospital,\" it added.\n\n\"These challenges are putting services at the hospital - such as respiratory and gastrointestinal (GI) inpatient medical provision - at risk.\n\n\"Every avenue is being pursued to protect services.\"\n\nSouthern Trust chief executive Dr Maria O'Kane told BBC's Evening Extra programme that in the last year \"nine consultants have left and six of those left during the last three to six months\".\n\nWith only one such medical consultant remaining, the trust has said it cannot staff rotas to ensure all services are delivered safely.\n\nAccording to sources, senior management told a trust board meeting on Thursday it would take at least six months to stabilise the system, but action needed to be taken in advance of the summer holidays.\n\nMedical consultants diagnose, admit and treat patients who may come into hospital via the emergency department (ED).\n\nTheir specialities include cardiovascular and respiratory disease, as well as gastrointestinal disease.\n\nWithout that expertise, a hospital is unable to function at its full capacity.\n\nIn future, people who become ill, including those who suffer a stroke, may have to travel to Craigavon, Ulster, or Royal Victoria Hospitals, or to a hospital in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nIt is understood senior staff plan to have talks with Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.\n\nCraigavon Area Hospital, which is about 30 minutes drive from Daisy Hill, is likely to inherit most of the overflow.\n\nThe trust said that as there are \"insufficient substantive stroke consultants at Daisy Hill\", the decision had been taken \"on patient safety grounds to again divert all acute stroke patients to Craigavon Area Hospital\".\n\nThe trust said recruiting and retaining medical staff has been a major issue in the hospital in recent years\n\nIt said this would come into effect from 09:00 on 31 May and that the same measure was taken in February \"due to unforeseen staffing issues\".\n\nCraigavon Area Hospital often reports delays in its own emergency department.\n\nIn February, the Southern Health Trust announced the relocation of emergency general surgery from Daisy Hill to Craigavon.\n\nPreviously the trust had described that move as \"interim\" and due to ongoing recruitment challenges.\n\nIn October, the then health minister, Robin Swann announced that Daisy Hill Hospital was to become an elective overnight stay centre.\n\nAt the time, he said centres were being established as part of a reorganisation of surgery services.\n\nSeveral clinicians and the public voiced concern about the future of the hospital.\n\nThose consultants who have recently left Daisy Hill Hospital have retired, resigned, moved to another hospital in Northern Ireland or moved to the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe trust, however, has insisted that general emergency surgery, the emergency department and maternity services were all currently safe.\n\nCraigavon Area Hospital often reports delays in its own emergency department\n\nThe trust has said it plans to increase its acute care at home service.\n\nThat means patients who are normally admitted to hospital will be treated by clinicians at home instead.\n\nDr Tom Black, chairman of the British Medical Association (BMA) in Northern Ireland, said the announcement that some services are being withdrawn from Daisy Hill Hospital is \"extremely worrying\".\n\n\"Acute medical services at the hospital look increasingly precarious,\" he said.\n\n\"Transformation due to service collapse benefits neither patients nor doctors and destabilises services for patients.\n\n\"There will be a knock-on effect on services in Craigavon Hospital and any further attrition would impact GP services in the area as well, thus putting unacceptable pressure on different parts of the health service.\"\n\nDr Donal Duffin, was a consultant physician at Daisy Hill Hospital for a number of years, and is a member of the Daisy Hill Futures Group.\n\nHe said there had been a \"significant problem\" with the retention of senior staff at the Daisy Hill site and that the hospital was a critical part of the healthcare system in Northern Ireland.\n\n\"At the moment the remaining staff are pulling out all the stops, keeping things going as far as they can, but this is not a sustainable situation without a dramatic intervention by the trust, but I don't think that's enough, I think it has to involve the trust, the Department of Health and the politicians,\" he told BBC News NI.\n\nDr Maria O'Kane says the shortage of medical staff is extremely challenging in Northern Ireland\n\nDr O'Kane told the trust's monthly board meeting that the shortage of consultants, difficulties recruiting specialist grade and junior doctors and the \"serious over-reliance\" on locum doctors \"are matters of great concern in meeting the demand for acute inpatient medicine and providing stable medical staffing cover in our medical wards\".\n\n\"This situation is certainly not unique to Daisy Hill Hospital,\" she said.\n\n\"The shortage of medical staff is extremely challenging in Northern Ireland, and indeed further afield.\"\n\nShe added that the trust continued to pursue every viable option to minimise the impact of this situation and stabilise its workforce.\n\nIn April, several hundred people attended a protest in Newry over the planned removal of emergency general surgery at Daisy Hill Hospital\n\nMs O'Kane said a meeting would take place next week involving all trusts to \"seek support to address these challenges\".\n\nShe said it needed to be recognised that medical staffing is \"already stretched across Craigavon Area and other NI hospitals, so any support is likely to be limited\".\n\n\"Our initial focus will be to stabilise staffing for the summer months in anticipation of a more permanent solution,\" she said.\n\n\"Ensuring patient safety and supporting our staff will be absolute priorities.\n\n\"We are very proud of the care provided by our medical staff, who have been working in very difficult circumstances.\"\n\nSeparately, the number of people on hospital waiting lists in Northern Ireland has been described as \"entirely unacceptable\" by the Department of Health's permanent secretary Peter May.\n\nThe latest figures show that in the first quarter this year 401,201 people were waiting for their first outpatient appointment with a consultant.\n\nThat is 27,174 more than at the same time last year.\n\nThe statistics also show that 81% of patients were waiting more than nine weeks for a first consultant-led outpatient appointment.\n\nOne of the department's targets was that by March this year at least 50% of patients should wait no longer than nine weeks for this.\n\nHowever, there has been some progress.\n\nThe number of inpatient and day case admissions waiting more than 13 weeks to be admitted for treatment was down, from 102,164 at the same time last year to 94,305 at the end of March.\n\nThe Northern Ireland director of the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS), Prof Mark Taylor expressed \"grave concern\" at the figures.\n\n\"The waiting time figures come on the back of a hammer blow to elective recovery this week by the Department of Health after it revealed plans to axe \u00a334m from its waiting lists initiative programme due to huge budget pressures,\" he said.", "Sir Elton John, Carole King and Hilary Clinton were among those paying tribute to Bennett (pictured in 2017)\n\nTony Bennett was \"singing at his piano\" just days before he died, his representatives have revealed.\n\nThe legendary New York pop and jazz singer died on Friday aged 96.\n\nA statement posted on his Twitter account said: \"Tony left us today but he was still singing the other day at his piano and his last song was Because of You, his first #1 hit.\n\n\"Tony, because of you we have your songs in our heart forever.\"\n\nSir Elton John, Carole King and Hilary Clinton were among those paying tribute to the star on social media.\n\nBennett was known for songs such as The Way You Look Tonight, Body and Soul and (I Left My Heart) In San Francisco.\n\nHe also collaborated with star performers from Lady Gaga to Aretha Franklin and Frank Sinatra, who called him \"the best singer in the business\".\n\nDuring a career that spanned eight decades, Bennett sold millions of records and won 20 Grammys, including a lifetime achievement award.\n\nBennett had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2016\n\nBennett's death was confirmed by his publicist Sylvia Weiner in a statement to the Associated Press.\n\nShe said he died in his hometown of New York. No specific cause of death was announced, but Bennett had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2016.\n\nSir Elton John led the tributes on social media, writing in a statement posted on his Instagram that he was \"so sad to hear of Tony's passing\".\n\n\"Without doubt the classiest singer, man, and performer you will ever see,\" Sir Elton said. \"He's irreplaceable. I loved and adored him. Condolences to Susan, Danny and the family.\"\n\nThe White House released a statement saying that \"Tony Bennett didn't just sing the classics - he himself was an American classic\" and praising his enduring contributions to American life.\n\nFormer US first lady Hillary Clinton described Bennett as a \"true talent, a true gentleman, and a true friend\". She tweeted: \"We'll miss you, Tony, and thanks for all the memories.\"\n\nSinger Carole King said: \"RIP Tony Bennett. Such a big loss.

His was a unique voice that made the transition from the era of Jazz into the age of Pop.\n\n\"I will always be grateful for his outstanding contribution to the art of contemporary music. He was a joy to work with. His energy and enthusiasm for the material he was performing was infectious. He was also one of the nicest human beings I've ever known.\"\n\nDirector Martin Scorsese added: \"Tony Bennett was a consummate artist. All you have to do is listen to any one of his hundreds of recordings to recognise that.\n\n\"Very early on, his music quietly wove itself into the fabric of our lives. His voice felt as familiar and as close as the voices of our loved ones. I know that this was true for millions of people around the world.\"\n\nBennett (pictured in 2003) won 19 competitive Grammys as well as an additional lifetime achievement award\n\nBorn Anthony Dominick Benedetto, to a family of Italian immigrants, Bennett was just nine years old when his father died, plunging the family further into poverty.\n\nAs a teenager he became a singing waiter before enrolling to study music and painting at New York's School of Industrial Art.\n\nHe was drafted into the US army in 1944 to fight in France and Germany towards the end of World War Two. \"It's legalised murder,\" he said of the scarring experience in an interview with the Guardian in 2013.\n\nAfter returning home, his singing career continued - first under the name Joe Bari - and his breakthrough came in 1951 the song Because of You, which gave him first number one.\n\nHe changed his name to the Americanised Tony Bennett on the say so of fellow entertainer Bob Hope.\n\nBennett soon became a teenage icon, releasing his first album in 1952. The same year his wedding was besieged by female fans in mourning.\n\nHe went on to chart in the US in every subsequent decade of his life, building a reputation for making timeless swinging jazz-inflected pop hits - like Blue Velvet and Rags to Riches - and, later, show tunes and big band numbers.\n\nBennett pictured performing with singer KD Lang in New York in 2002\n\nHis 1962 version of a song from the previous decade, I Left My Heart in San Francisco, sent his star into an even bigger orbit, winning him two Grammys.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs about his love of the excitement of jazz he said: \"Jazz artists live for the moment.\"\n\nBennett was a supporter of the civil rights movement and took part in the 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches while also refusing to perform in apartheid-era South Africa.\n\nHowever, with the arrival of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones into the US, as the decade rolled on his relevance faded.\n\nPersonal problems followed, including the end of two marriages and drug addiction.\n\nHe performed through the pain, recording two records with pianist Bill Evans.\n\nAfter hiring his son Danny to become his manager and reuniting with his pianist and musical director Ralph Sharon, his fortunes began to change.\n\nHe enjoyed a revival in the 1980s and 1990s, when Grammy awards flooded in for the star, then in his sixties.\n\nHis 1986 comeback album, The Art of Excellence, got the ball rolling again for the star who had returned to New York from Las Vegas.\n\nBennett, pictured on the BBC Breakfast show in 2010, became the torchbearer for the Great American Songbook, releasing more than 70 albums in total\n\nHe followed it with the chart-topping Perfectly Frank, a tribute to his musical hero Sinatra, before 1994's MTV Unplugged saw Bennett win the Grammy for album of the year.\n\nIn an interview with the Independent in 2008, Bennett said he had not been surprised by his renewed success.\n\n\"Good music is good music,\" he said. \"I'm not concerned with whether someone who listens to me is old or young. In fact, in many ways, I'm not interested in the young at all.\n\n\"I'm interested in age. People learn to live properly when they get of an age, you know? The late Duke Ellington once said to me that he was really offended by the word category.\n\n\"Music has no category; it's either good or it isn't, and I sing good songs, great songs, written by the best songwriters. It's that kind of quality that makes them last. Trust me, people will be singing these songs forever.\"\n\nBennett remained perpetually cool enough to win over new legions of fans.\n\nThis YouTube post cannot be displayed in your browser.

On a wire fence around the site were photos of dozens of people, mostly men, who had been killed by jihadists from the Islamic State group. They were from Zile-li, a village near the quarry, where 1,800 men were taken and killed on 3 August 2014.\n\nThe Yazidis revere both the Quran and the Bible; their religion is influenced by both Christianity and Islam. Islamic State considered them to be infidels and carried out a genocidal assault. It happened after the Americans and British had ended their occupation, but a direct line links the massacre to the invasion, and the disastrous years that followed.\n\nAmong those watching the excavation was Naif Jasso, the Sheikh of Kocho, a Yazidi community that suffered an even worse attack than Zile-li. He said that in Kocho, 517 people out of a population of 1,250 were killed by jihadists from IS, also known as ISIS or Daesh.\n\nIn Zile-li, men were separated from their families at gunpoint and shot dead at the quarry. Sofian Saleh, who was 16 at the time, was among the crowd at the excavation. He is one of only two men from Zile-li who survived. As he waited for death with his father, brother and 20 to 30 other men, he saw another group shot dead. Their bodies tumbled down a cliff into the quarry. Then it was their turn.\n\n\"They tied our hands from behind before the shooting. They took us and threw us on the ground,\" he said.\n\nSofian's father and brother were killed, but he survived because bodies fell on him, covering him up.\n\nSofian Saleh is one of only two men who survived\n\nIslamic State was using its favourite tactic. First, they killed the men, then took the women as slaves. Children were removed from their mothers to be indoctrinated as IS recruits. A mother sitting near the suspected grave wept as she remembered the baby ripped from her and given to a jihadist family.\n\nNext to the wire fence around the site, Suad Daoud Chatto, a woman in her 20s, stood with a poster. On it were the faces of nine men from her extended family who were killed, and two missing female relatives. She said jihadists captured her in 2014 when she was 16, along with many other women and girls, and held her in Syria. She remained until 2019, when she was rescued as the Caliphate collapsed.\n\nSuad Daoud Chatto holds a poster showing nine of her relatives who were killed\n\n\"They were like barbarians, they kept us in handcuffs for a long time. Our hands were still tied even during the meals,\" she said.\n\n\"They married me off many times\u2026 they were marrying the slaves. They did not spare anyone. We were all raped. They were killing people before our eyes. They killed all the Yazidi men - they killed eight of my uncles. They destroyed many families.\"\n\nIn the end, only a few bags of human bones were found at the site. Dozens of others are still to excavated.\n\nBy the time IS rampaged through Iraq in the summer of 2014, the US and the UK had ended their occupation. Jihadist ideology existed long before the invasion, and had inspired the 9/11 attacks.\n\nBut far from destroying the ideology of Osama Bin Laden and the jihadist extremists, the years of chaos and brutality set off in 2003 turbo-charged murderous jihadist violence. Al-Qaeda, broken for a while by an alliance between the Americans and Sunni tribes, regenerated into the even more barbarous IS.\n\nIraq is more stable so far this year than it has been for a long while. Baghdad, Mosul and other cities are much safer. But Iraqis feel the results of the invasion every day. Its consequences have shaped and blighted millions of lives and changed their country profoundly.\n\nIt is a grim irony that the invasion has dropped out of political and public debate in the US, which conceived and led it, and in the UK, its closest ally in the coalition. The Americans and British bear a heavy responsibility for what happened after the invasion, and its consequences also affect them.\n\nIraq's tyrant, Saddam Hussein, was well worth overthrowing - he had imprisoned and killed thousands of Iraqis, even using chemical weapons against rebellious Kurds. The problem was how it was done, the way the US and UK ignored international law, and the violence that gripped Iraq after the Bush administration failed to make a plan to fill the power vacuum created by regime change.\n\nThe past 20 years since the invasion, coming on top of Saddam's dictatorship, add up to almost half a century of torture for the Iraqi people.\n\nEven for those who were there, it is hard to recreate the febrile atmosphere of \"fear, power and hubris\", as one historian put it recently, that gripped the US in the 18 months between al-Qaeda's 9/11 attacks in 2001 and the invasion of Iraq.\n\nI was in New York a few days after the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center were destroyed, as F-15 jets patrolled above Manhattan. It was a visible demonstration of American force, as the biggest military power on the planet worked out how to respond.\n\nThe shock of the attacks swiftly produced George W Bush's declaration of \"war on terror\" against al-Qaeda and its jihadist fellow travellers. UK Prime Minister Tony Blair chartered Concorde to cross the Atlantic to offer support. He believed Britain's best guarantee of influence in the world was to stay close to the White House.\n\nUS President George W Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair at the White House in November 2001\n\nThey moved fast against al-Qaeda's network in Afghanistan. Before the end of the year, a US-led coalition removed the Taliban regime from power when it refused to give up al-Qaeda's leader, Osama Bin Laden. Kabul was not enough for America.\n\nPresident Bush and his advisors saw a global threat to the US. They thought states that opposed them could make deadly alliances with al-Qaeda and its imitators. The biggest target in their sights was Iraq. Saddam Hussein had been a thorn in America's side ever since he sent his army into Kuwait in 1990. Without any evidence, the Americans tried to manufacture a link between Saddam and al-Qaeda when none existed. In reality the Iraqi leader, a secular dictator, saw religious extremists as a threat.\n\nThe president's father, George HW Bush, decided not to remove Saddam from power in Baghdad after the Iraqi occupiers were driven out of Kuwait by an international coalition assembled by the US in 1991. The first President Bush and his advisors saw trouble ahead if they continued to Baghdad. A long, belligerent occupation of Iraq looked like a morass and they had no UN authorisation to topple the regime.\n\nI was in Baghdad when the ceasefire was declared. Regime officials I knew could not believe that Saddam's dictatorship had survived.\n\nTwelve years later, by 2003, America's rage and arrogance of power blinded the second President Bush to the realities that had constrained his father. When the US and UK could not persuade the UN Security Council to pass a resolution explicitly authorising invasion and regime change, Messrs Bush and Blair claimed earlier resolutions gave them the authority they needed.\n\nAmong many who did not buy their argument was the UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan. In a BBC interview 18 months after the invasion, he said it was \"not in conformity\" with the UN Charter - in other words, illegal. France and other Nato allies refused to join the invasion. Tony Blair ignored huge protests in the UK. His decision to go to war dogged the rest of his political career.\n\nNo president or prime minister faces a bigger decision than going to war. George Bush and Tony Blair embarked on a war of choice that killed hundreds of thousands of people. The justifications for the invasion were soon shown to be untrue. The weapons of mass destruction that Tony Blair insisted, eloquently, made Saddam a clear and present danger, turned out not to exist. It was a failure not just of intelligence but of leadership.\n\nUS Marines from the 1st Marine Division get set to deploy close to Baghdad in April 2003\n\nThe Americans called the huge air raids that started their offensive \"shock and awe\". Neo-conservatives around George W Bush deluded themselves that democracy, and regional stability, could be imposed through the barrel of a gun. Overwhelming US force would not just safeguard America, it would stabilise the Middle East too, and democracy would spread through Syria, Iran and beyond, like a good virus.\n\nUS troops topple a statue of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad\n\nSaddam was removed within weeks. Iraqis were in no mood to be grateful. In Saddam's last decade as leader, the vast majority of them had been impoverished by sanctions authorised by the UN, but driven hardest by the US and UK. The Americans, the British and their allies were unable to bring peace to the streets. Nightmarish years started with wholesale looting, revenge attacks and crime.\n\nIraqi Sunni Muslim insurgents in front of a burning US convoy on the outskirts of Fallujah in 2004\n\nAn insurgency against the occupation turned into a sectarian civil war. Iraqis turned against each other as the Americans imposed a system of government that split power along ethnic and sectarian lines - between the country's three main groups, Shia Muslims, Kurds and Sunni Muslims. Armed militias fought each other, the occupiers, and killed each other's civilians.\n\nJihadist groups moved in to exploit the chaos and kill foreigners. Before the Americans managed to kill him, a brutal Sunni extremist from Jordan, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, targeted attacks to turn the insurgency against the occupation into a sectarian civil war. Shia death squads retaliated with their own reign of terror.\n\nNo-one knows exactly how many Iraqis have died as a result of the 2003 invasion. Estimates are all in the hundreds of thousands. The tide of violent sectarianism continues to rumble around the Middle East.\n\nThe geopolitical legacy of the invasion is still shaping events. Unwittingly, the Americans turned the balance of power in Iraq in Iran's favour by overthrowing Saddam Hussein, who was considered a Sunni bulwark against the Islamic Republic. Removing him empowered Shia politicians who were close to Tehran. Militias armed and trained by Iran are among the most powerful forces in Iraq and have representatives in government.\n\nThe US and UK's fear of causing another disaster hamstrung their response to the Arab uprisings of 2011, and especially the war against his own people launched by President Bashar al-Assad in Syria.\n\nDisorder in Iraq, where the population is growing fast, fuels the trade in people-smuggling to Europe. According to the British Home Office, Iraqis are the fourth largest national group crossing the English Channel in small boats. The UK Refugee Council says the vast majority whose cases have been processed are granted asylum as refugees.\n\nAmerican and British leaders do not dwell on the invasion these days, but others have not forgotten. One reason why much of the global south stayed neutral after Russia invaded Ukraine, ignoring appeals to uphold international law, was the memory of how the US, the UK and Western allies who joined the coalition ignored it as they steamrollered opposition to their invasion of Iraq.\n\nIt is a sign of how bad the past 20 years have been that Saddam nostalgia is well established in Iraq, not just among his own Sunni community. People complain that at least you knew where you were with the old dictator. He was an equal opportunities killer of anyone he saw as an enemy, including his own son-in-law.\n\nIn a queue for diesel in a camp near Mosul, a 48-year-old Sunni named Mohammed, raged against the Shia-led government in Baghdad and against the years of sectarian killing that followed the invasion.\n\n\"We wish that Saddam's rule could come back, even for one day. Saddam was a dictator, and it was one man's rule - correct. But he was not killing the people based on whether they were Shia, Sunni, Kurdish, or Yazidi.\"\n\nIraq has signs of hope. Parts of towns and villages are still in ruins, but they feel safer, even though Iraqis still face threats that would be considered a national crisis in the West. Well-trained anti-terrorist units are containing IS jihadist cells, who still manage to carry out bombings and ambushes. Even so, shopkeepers are hoping for a bumper Ramadan, their busiest time of the year.\n\nLonger term, the biggest legacy of the invasion for Iraq might be the political system that the Americans instigated, which divides power along ethnic and sectarian lines. As developed by Iraqi politicians, it has offered prodigious chances for corruption.\n\nEstimates of the amount stolen since 2003 range from $150bn (\u00a3124bn) to $320bn (\u00a3264bn). Most Iraqis, of all sects, who have not benefited from the bonanza of theft, face constant power cuts, bad water, and inadequate medical care, in hospitals that were once considered to be as good as ones in Europe. Walk down most streets and you will see children working or begging, instead of going to school. Iraq used to have one of the best educational systems in the Middle East.\n\nIraq's latest prime minister, Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, has promised a new start. His biggest challenge is keeping his promise to tackle corruption, the cancer that is eating the country from within. He even did a broadcast surrounded by piles of confiscated banknotes that were being returned to Iraq's treasury.\n\nBut the people that matter most are the innocent victims. Not just the dead, but millions of Iraqis, and others in the Middle East whose lives were made much worse because of the invasion and its consequences.\n\nAt the mass grave near Sinjar, Yazidi activists appealed for international protection. Survivors said that the IS jihadists who carried out the genocidal massacres in 2014 had Iraqi accents, some from Tel Afar, a nearby town.\n\nFarhad Barakat, a 25-year-old Yazidi activist who survived because he managed to escape to Mount Sinjar, said they were still scared of their neighbours. The killers, he said, were from their \"surrounding clans or tribes, Arab clans. So how it that possible? The ones who killed us, raped the Yazidi women, they were Iraqis.\"\n\nThe BBC's security correspondent Gordon Corera seeks to find new answers to why the Iraq war happened, what it meant, and its legacy today.\n\nListen at 13:45 BST each weekday or stream or download all 10 episodes on BBC Sounds", "Since getting Covid three years ago Iva Safrova spends much of her time at home, often in bed\n\nIva Safrova's existence is unrecognisable from the full and active life she led three years ago.\n\nBack in March 2020 she got Covid-19 when she was a health care worker on a renal ward at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales - and she never recovered.\n\n\"My life is ruined,\" said the 59-year old from Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan.\n\n\"No job, no social life.

How the Royal children enjoyed the Coronation\n\nThe prospect of a two-hour church service, full of ceremony and importance, is a daunting prospect for most, let alone if you've just turned five.\n\nBut luckily for Prince Louis, the youngest royal at the Coronation had his sister Princess Charlotte to hold his hand, physically and metaphorically.\n\nTheir older brother Prince George had a formal part to play as one of their grandfather King Charles' pages of honour.\n\nBut Louis and Charlotte ended up taking a starring role too thanks to their antics during the day.\n\nThey arrived with their parents the Prince and Princess of Wales, with Charlotte in a matching Alexander McQueen outfit to her mother, down to a miniature version of Catherine's silver leaf headdress.\n\nLouis, meanwhile, wore a dark blue tunic by Savile Row tailors Dege and Skinner.\n\nPerhaps offering reassurance, or making sure he went the right way, eight-year-old Charlotte held Louis' hand as they processed through the abbey behind their parents.\n\nOnce the Coronation proper started, they took their front row seats alongside their parents. The solemn, religious ceremony elicited a yawn or two from the young prince - and he could also at times be seen pointing things out to Charlotte from their seats near the high altar.\n\nHis age is no doubt why a break was arranged, with viewers noticing Louis had disappeared from his seat, returning in time to sing God Save the King.\n\nHe had not attended the last major royal event, the funeral of his great-grandmother Queen Elizabeth II in September, when he was just four, as he was felt to be too young.\n\nThe siblings followed along with the order of service during the Coronation\n\nBut that wasn't enough to stop Louis from yawning during the two-hour event\n\nAfter the King was crowned and the formal part of the day was over, the Wales family met up with Prince George as he completed his duties.\n\nThey took their places in the royal procession to Buckingham Palace, in the first carriage behind the Gold State Coach.\n\nLouis pressed his face close to the glass on one side of the bench, sat opposite his parents, as he waved at the waiting crowds.\n\nLouis gave the crowds a smile and a wave as they made their way to Buckingham Palace\n\nLouis made headlines himself at last summer's Jubilee celebrations when he was seen pulling faces on the Buckingham Palace balcony and appearing to scream when the flypast went overhead.\n\nAnyone hoping for similar scenes after the Coronation would not have been disappointed.\n\nHe drummed his fingers on the balcony railing at one point, and showed his own version of the royal wave.\n\nThe two-handed wave, not dissimilar to the motion of windscreen wipers, was perhaps apt for a rainy day.\n\nThe children were seen pointing at the sky during the flypast before returning inside the palace after their long day.", "Animal Rising said the women took the lambs from Appleton Farm on the Sandringham Estate\n\nLambs stolen from a field on the King's Sandringham Estate are still missing following the release on police bail of three women suspected of stealing them.\n\nActivists Animal Rising said it took three lambs from a field at West Newton in Norfolk on Wednesday, because the animals were due to be slaughtered.\n\nThree women aged in their 20s and 30s were arrested in Slough, Berkshire, on suspicion of theft.\n\nNorfolk Police said the women had been told to answer police bail in July.\n\nAnimal Rising said the women handed themselves into police in Berkshire at 08:00 on Thursday, with banners saying: \"I rescued the King's sheep\" and \"This is how we love animals\".\n\nIt added the lambs were were \"safe\" and now with animal experts.\n\nNorfolk Police said anyone with information on the missing lambs should contact them.\n\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

It has also ended its joint ventures with the state energy giant Gazprom.\n\nAnd it said it would start a \"phased withdrawal from Russian petroleum products, pipeline gas and LNG\". But it warned that it would be a \"complex challenge\".\n\nShell said last year it would close all its service stations in Russia\n\nSince then, it has kept taking cargoes of LNG from two Russian ports, the one at Yamal and one at Sakhalin in the far east.\n\nShell used to be a minority investor in the Sakhalin gas project, but abandoned that claim in September last year after the Russian government transferred its shares to a local business - and since then has taken no gas from Sakhalin.\n\nBut it still honours the contract with the Russian LNG company Novatek, which obliges it to buy 900,000 tonnes a year from Yamal until the 2030s, according to the Reuters news agency.\n\nNovatek is Russia's second biggest gas company, and the taxes it pays are a significant contributor to the Russian government's budget.\n\nOleg Ustenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian president, said: \"It is quite simple: by continuing to trade in Russian gas Shell is putting money into Putin's pockets and helping to fund Russia's brutal aggression against the people of Ukraine.\n\n\"The vast sums that Shell and the whole oil industry have made in Russia should be used to help fund the reconstruction of Ukraine, rather than lining the pockets of their shareholders.\"\n\nA spokesman for Shell said: \"Shell has stopped buying Russian LNG on the spot market, but still has some long-term contractual commitments. This is in full compliance with sanctions, applicable laws and regulations of the countries in which we operate.\n\n\"There is a dilemma between putting pressure on the Russian government over its atrocities in Ukraine and ensuring stable, secure energy supplies. It is for governments to decide on the incredibly difficult trade-offs that must be made.\"\n\nShell is the world's largest trader of LNG, which is not subject to European sanctions, making billions of dollars in profits trading oil and gas last year.\n\nRussia massively reduced its deliveries of gas by pipeline last year, but it has increased the amount of gas it supplies by ship, including to Europe.\n\nThe UK has not imported any Russian gas for over a year, while EU politicians are trying to reduce the amount of Russian LNG the bloc imports. In March, the EU's Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson called on countries and firms to stop buying Russian gas, and not to sign new contracts.\n\n\"It's long overdue that the trading of Russian LNG is looked at with the same disgust as Russian oil trading. Targeting Putin's energy income cannot be about symbolic measures but must concretely put a stop to the huge fossil fuel sums that cement his power,\" said Jonathan Noronha-Gant, senior campaigner at Global Witness.\n\nThe France-based energy company TotalEnergies is a minority shareholder in the Yamal project, and was also a major trader in Russian LNG, the Global Witness analysis reported.\n\nThe BBC has approached TotalEnergies for comment.", "After a day in which the BBC produced a fuller timeline of its actions through this story, where are we now?\n\nFor the BBC, key questions remain, primarily around what it did having received the complaint in May.\n\nIt's difficult to assess the actions of the Corporate Investigations Team without knowing exactly the detail of the complaint. We still don't have that.\n\nBut on the face of it, one email attempt that the complainant didn't respond to and one phone call that didn't connect don't, on the surface of it, look like huge efforts were made to check out the allegations.\n\nThat might have been understandable if the complaint had been about a presenter getting a fact wrong in a broadcast.\n\nBut we know that it was deemed serious by the BBC, though not involving criminality. A serious complaint about a high-profile presenter, reportedly involving huge sums of money to a younger person, surely warranted more dedicated investigation.\n\nBBC director general Tim Davie may be all too aware of this, which is why he talked earlier about an internal review to assess whether the processes are up to scratch and whether red flags are raised quickly enough.\n\nThe BBC has now faced the media about this story. It had little choice as the briefing to launch the annual report was already in journalists' diaries.\n\nBut Mr Davie also appeared on the World at One on Radio 4 for a lengthy interview. His comment that this wasn't a \"good situation\" was an understatement.\n\nBut he also gave a clear explanation of what the BBC has been managing - balancing its duties as an employer of a presenter who must be treated fairly with its role as a public service broadcaster which aims for transparency.\n\nOf course, cynics might say that Mr Davie must have breathed a sigh of relief when the Metropolitan Police asked the BBC to pause its investigation. At one point in the interview, the director general said he couldn't comment for that reason.\n\nIt's the equivalent of kicking this into the, if not long, then certainly slightly taller than cropped, grass. A bit of a breathing space for the BBC to take stock.\n\nBut the pressure on Mr Davie and the corporation is intense, with media crews training their cameras on New Broadcasting House in central London for days now.\n\nThis story has become a series of claims and counterclaims. The Sun and the family stand by their account. The Sun told us it feels as if the family is \"being attacked by the BBC for not fully understanding their complaints system\".\n\nIt says that after the original complaint in May, a payment of \u00a31,000 was made in June to the young person by the presenter. A sign of \"no action\" from the BBC.\n\nIt does feel uncomfortable that the presenter was not spoken to by bosses for almost seven weeks. That the complaint was not escalated until the Sun approached the BBC before publishing its story.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: Tim Davie, the BBC's director general, faced questions on Tuesday about the corporation's presenter row\n\nBut the Sun also has questions to answer, particularly after the legal letter sent to the BBC on behalf of the young person on Monday.\n\nDid they approach the young person for comment as they prepared to report their story - as the lawyer claims they didn't. What evidence do they have to back up their allegations that have dominated the front pages? Why have they not named the presenter?\n\nIt's unclear how this story ends. The BBC has now reported allegations from a second person. The Sun has a new front page about the presenter allegedly breaking lockdown rules to meet a young stranger from a dating site.\n\nWill there be more to come - or just more claim and counter-claim?", "The Princess of Wales answered questions posed to her by students\n\nThe Princess of Wales has told students that becoming a member of the Royal Family was something she never expected - but she \"fell in love\".\n\nThe pupils quizzed Catherine about being a royal at a charity event in Bath, and the princess said it was something \"she had to learn\".\n\nCatherine was meeting St Katherine's School students supported by the Dame Kelly Holmes Trust.\n\nEarlier, she took on Dame Kelly at a game of bean-bag noughts and crosses.\n\nCompeting alongside the Bristol students, the princess was beaten twice.\n\nAfter the first victory, the track and field star held her arms aloft and admitted she was \"slightly competitive\".\n\nCatherine lost out to Dame Kelly's team twice\n\nThe princess joked back: \"You would never have guessed.\"\n\nWhen the princess later sat down in the Percy Community Centre for a chat with the students, she opened up the floor to questions about herself.\n\nDame Kelly said: \"She humanised everything to say not everyone's perfect.

You're fighting to save part of our collective cultural identity.\n\n\"But what's worrying me is that you might think your fight is purely financial. It's not.\"\n\nDescribing the battle as more nuanced, Ms Portas said what laid ahead was about \"the soul of your brand.\"\n\n\"Somehow, in recent years, you've let go of the soul.\"\n\nMary Portas said British brand history was littered with firms who tampered with the crown jewels of their identity\n\nHer letter said: \"What we want is to come to you when we're expecting our first baby and panicking about buying a cot... when we've finally made it onto the property ladder and want curtains and a sofa bed that'll last\".\n\nBut she warned that was \"being slowly chipped away. From loud headlines to daily whispers\".\n\nMs Portas said she appreciated the partnership needed \"money men\" but added: \"Never forget to balance all that with the commercially instinctive, reactive, creative, retail-born folk in the business.\n\n\"It's an art. Not a science.\"\n\nShe urged the group to recommit to the principles it was founded on - common ownership.\n\n\"We know British brand history is littered with those who tampered with the crown jewels of their identity.\n\n\"But failure for John Lewis and Waitrose is not an option.

He was eventually found hiding at his grandfather's house, Serbian broadcaster RTS reported.\n\nEarly on Friday morning, Serbian media said that special police forces had arrived at the villages of Mladenovac and Dubona, where the latest shooting occurred.\n\nPhotos from the scene showed police officers stopping cars at checkpoints as they tried to find the gunman. A helicopter, drones and multiple police patrols were also used.\n\nReports on local media say the suspect - who the interior ministry said was born in 2002 - started firing at people with an automatic weapon after having an argument with a police officer in a park in Dubona on Thursday evening.\n\nMilan Proki\u0107, a Dubona resident, told Radio Belgrade 1 he heard shots near his house: \"It's sad, regrettable, we locked ourselves in our home so [the shots] wouldn't come to us.\"\n\nThe man is then said to have proceeded to shoot people from a car, killing at least eight people and wounding many more.\n\nAll injured people admitted to hospital were born after the year 2000, RTS reported.\n\nTwo people aged 21 and 23 were operated on, but remain in critical condition.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference after the attack on Friday, Serbia's president said the suspect had been wearing a T-shirt with neo-Nazi symbols, but no further details were given.\n\nPresident Vucic called the shooting \"an attack on us all\" and announced a host of new security measures, including a plan to hire 1,200 new police officers.\n\nHe also announced a ban on new gun permits, tougher penalties for illegal weapons possession and psychological checks of gun owners. He said the new laws would result in the \"practical disarmament\" of Serbia.\n\nOn Wednesday, a thirteen-year-old boy shot dead eight fellow pupils at his school in Belgrade, as well as a security guard. It prompted the Serbian government to propose tighter restrictions of gun ownership.\n\nNBA basketball player Luka Doncic said he would pay for the funerals of all nine people killed in Wednesday's shooting, and for grief counselling for classmates and staff.\n\nMass shootings are extremely rare in Serbia, which has very strict gun laws, but gun ownership in the country is among the highest in Europe.\n\nThe western Balkans are awash with illegal weapons following wars and unrest in the 1990s.

They are killing children who get in their path. They trample and eat farmers' crops leaving Africans hungry,\" said Botswana's wildlife minister.\n\nGermany is the EU's largest importer of African elephant trophies, and hunting trophies overall, according to a 2021 report by the Humane Society International.\n\nBotswana banned the practice in 2014, but lifted the restrictions in 2019 after facing pressure from local communities.\n\nThe country now issues annual hunting quotas, saying that it is licensed and strictly controlled.\n\nIt has previously considered using elephants for pet food.\n\nA spokeswoman for the environment ministry in Berlin told the AFP news agency that Botswana had not raised any concerns with Germany on the matter.\n\n\"In light of the alarming loss of biological diversity, we have a special responsibility to do everything to ensure the import of hunting trophies is sustainable and legal,\" she said.\n\nThe ministry, however, remained in talks with African countries affected by import rules, including Botswana, the spokeswoman said.\n\nAustralia, France and Belgium are among countries that have banned the trade in hunting trophies.\n\nBotswana, along with its neighbours Zimbabwe and Namibia, has also argued that it should be allowed to sell their stockpiles of ivory so it can earn money from its huge numbers of elephants.\n\nCountries in East Africa, as well as animal rights groups, have opposed this saying it would encourage poaching.", "A group of primary school children has suffered traumatic, \"life-changing\" injuries after a horrific bus crash in Melbourne, Australia.\n\nThe bus was carrying 45 students when police say it was hit by a truck from behind and rolled on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nSome 18 children - aged 5 to 11 - were rushed to hospital, many for emergency surgery. One remains in intensive care.\n\nThe truck driver has been charged with dangerous driving causing serious injury.\n\nAustralia has a below-average road safety record compared to other advanced economies. It ranks 20th of out of 36 OECD countries for road fatalities.\n\nPolice said the bus had only just left Exford Primary School, on the western fringes of Melbourne, when the collision occurred.\n\nChildren were trapped inside the bus before bystanders - including the truck driver and many of their teachers, who had rushed to the scene - helped emergency responders to free them from the wreckage.\n\nSurgeons worked into the early hours of the morning to treat those children seriously hurt. Their injuries included crushed limbs - forcing amputations - as well as head injuries, spinal injuries and serious cuts.\n\nSeven children remain at the hospital in serious conditions, including one in intensive care, the Royal Children's Hospital said.\n\n\"It is just distressing, knowing what our kids have been through and I can just imagine their fear,\" principal Lisa Campo told media on Wednesday.\n\nThe 52-year-old bus driver was also taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese was among those who thanked first responders and sent well-wishes to the families involved.\n\n\"Any accident is just horrific, the fact that it involves school students just breaks your heart,\" he said.\n\nSuperintendent Michael Cruse said the scene of the crash was extremely confronting for all who were there.\n\n\"Some of the injuries are life changing [and] this incident was avoidable,\" he said.\n\nThe 49-year-old truck driver - who suffered minor injuries - has since been charged with four counts of dangerous driving.\n\nInvestigations are ongoing, but Supt Cruse said \"inattention\" would be a key focus, and more charges are likely to be laid.", "Jacqueline Gold famously brought the vibrator into the front rooms of middle England, helping to spark a social revolution for the prudish British.\n\nBut as the tributes that poured in after her death, at the age of 62, have highlighted, she also launched an overhaul in attitudes more broadly, inspiring a generation of women entrepreneurs and bringing sex onto the High Street.\n\nHer insight was one shared by half of the population already - that women had sexual appetites too - and that that represented a huge untapped market. She arrived at Ann Summers, the family business, crashing through social taboos, and refashioned it after her own purpose.\n\n\"She absolutely paved the way for women to feel empowered in the bedroom and the boardroom and really brought female sexuality into the mainstream,\" says Lucy Litwack, chief executive of Coco de Mer, another British sex toy and lingerie retailer, that followed in Ann Summers' wake.\n\n\"[But] it was her vision and championing of women, that I found so inspiring, that I think will be her legacy,\" she says.\n\nJacqueline Gold often spoke about the initial scepticism she faced at Ann Summers, then a small chain oriented towards male customers. She suggested they reach out to women, inviting them to host Tupperware-style parties to sell lingerie and sex toys in their homes. The board took some convincing.\n\nBut she had other stories to tell too, that illustrated the hurdles she faced, as she took charge at the family firm.\n\nCharlotte Hardie, Editor of Retail Week, where Jacqueline Gold was a guest contributor, recalls the controversial launch of an Ann Summers store in Dublin in 1999.\n\n\"It came up against a lot of criticism from religious groups,\" says Ms Hardie. \"They did not want her to open this store and there was lots of bad PR.\"\n\nThere were petitions and protests. Jacqueline was even sent a bullet through the post.\n\nBut says Ms Hardie: \"She hated the idea that she was going to be bullied into not opening a store, so she ploughed on regardless.\n\n\"She was hugely resilient, hugely determined, and she always did what she set out to do.\"\n\nAnother example: when the government said Ann Summers couldn't advertise for staff in Jobcentres, she took them to court and won.\n\nBut although she was determined, friends say she never tried to prove she was more ruthless than the men around her, or change her behaviour in an effort to fit their mould.\n\n\"She was always kind, welcoming, empathetic, she displayed all those leadership qualities that are so admired today,\" says Ms Hardie.\n\nShe even accepted in good humour the time at a Retail Week conference when she was waiting backstage to join a panel and a well-known chief executive from another firm assumed she was a member of staff.\n\n\"He said: 'Dear, would you mind just just getting me a glass of water?',\" says Ms Hardie.\n\nWhile Jacqueline was incensed at the time, she did fetch him a drink, and was able to laugh about it afterwards.\n\nJacqueline Gold also had huge hurdles to overcome in her private life, which she shared in her autobiography. She was sexually abused by her step-father and suffered from depression.\n\nAs an adult, she struggled to conceive, went through IVF treatment but lost her infant son Alfie at the age of eight months. Later the nanny to her daughter attempted to poison Jacqueline with screenwash.\n\nYet, despite these challenges, she always seemed to have a twinkle in her eye, according to her friend Jacqueline Hurst, a life coach.\n\n\"She just had this lust for life,\" says Ms Hurst.\n\nShe loved breaking taboos, especially the idea of the little woman at home, cooking, without much more to their lives, she recalls.\n\nShe was a \"powerhouse of determination\" when it came to supporting other women, says Ms Hurst, organising breakfasts and other get togethers so women could talk, taking part in groups that supported women in business. She launched her own scheme on social media to provide mentoring for women entrepreneurs.\n\nAnd she was always perfectly turned out, dressed elegantly, in heels, says Ms Hurst, because underneath it all her philosophy was as much about enjoying life as making money.\n\n\"I think that's the biggest thing I'd take away from her, is to always remember to have fun,\" she says. That, and: \"Don't let anyone tell you you can't\".", "Shema had been told her chances of conceiving naturally were slim\n\nThe chance of becoming pregnant naturally after having an IVF baby is quite high, about one in five, which is something couples should be aware of, researchers say.\n\nIt is news that could give some fresh hope around planning a family, they say, or important information about contraception.\n\nThey analysed data from more than 5,000 women to judge how common it was.\n\nThe findings are averages over three years.\n\nThe odds for individuals will differ.\n\nAccording to the NHS, the chance of any couple conceiving naturally within the next year, if they have already been trying for a few years, is one in four, or less.\n\nInfertility is usually diagnosed only after a couple have failed to conceive despite a year of trying.\n\nBut since female fertility declines with age, women aged over 35, and anyone already aware they may have fertility problems, should see their GP sooner, according to the advice.\n\nFertility problems can be permanent or come and go and can affect either partner. There are lots of treatable reasons, but for about one in four couples it may not be possible to find a cause.\n\nFertility treatments, such as in-vitro fertilisation (IVF), are not always free on the NHS.\n\nOne cycle of IVF treatment may cost up to \u00a35,000 or more.\n\nShema Tariq, from London, was diagnosed with \"low ovarian reserve\", meaning she had fewer remaining eggs, and told her chances of conceiving without IVF were almost zero.\n\nIt took six rounds of IVF to conceive her son, who was born in 2018.\n\n\"My GP briefly mentioned contraception to me after he was born - but we both laughed and agreed that it wasn't relevant,\" Shema says.\n\n\"It never occurred to me that I might get pregnant, despite being a sexual-health doctor.\n\n\"I was 43 and had been told that my chances of conceiving naturally were less than 1%.\n\n\"Eight months later, I was unexpectedly, and naturally, pregnant with our daughter.\n\n\"She has been the most wonderful surprise - but when we first found out, I felt overwhelmed and unprepared for another pregnancy.\n\n\"If I'd known that one in five women conceives naturally after IVF, I'd have used contraception until I was ready both emotionally and physically.\"\n\nLead author of the new research, published in the journal Human Reproduction, Dr Annette Thwaites, from University College London, said: \"Our findings suggest that natural pregnancy after having a baby by IVF is far from rare.\n\n\"This is in contrast with widely held views - by women and health professionals - and those commonly expressed in the media, that it is a highly unlikely event.\"\n\nThe 11 international studies her team looked at found at least one in five women conceived naturally after having had a baby using fertility treatment, mostly within three years. And this applied across the different types and outcomes of fertility treatment.\n\nClinical Embryologist Dr Marta Jansa Perez, from the British Fertility Society, said: \"This study highlights the importance of giving patients accurate information about their chances of conception at any point, in particular after giving birth to an IVF baby.\n\n\"It is good news that such a high proportion of patients are able to conceive naturally after IVF, but people should be aware that in cases where the age of the woman is a factor for the initial failure to conceive or there is severe male factor infertility, it would be advisable to seek treatment for a second child sooner rather than later.\"", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nOne of the so-called \"godfathers\" of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has said he would have prioritised safety over usefulness had he realised the pace at which it would evolve.\n\nProf Yoshua Bengio told the BBC he felt \"lost\" over his life's work.\n\nThe computer scientist's comments come after experts in AI said it could lead to the extinction of humanity.\n\nProf Bengio, who has joined calls for AI regulation, said he did not think militaries should be granted AI powers.\n\nHe is the second of the so-called three \"godfathers\" of AI, known for their pioneering work in the field, to voice concerns about the direction and the speed at which it is developing.\n\nAI describes the ability of computers to perform tasks so complex, they have previously required human intelligence to complete.\n\nA recent example has been the development of AI-powered chatbots, like ChatGPT, which appear to give human-like responses to questions.\n\nThis has led to planned European Union legislation on AI. And on Wednesday, the bloc's technology chief, Margrethe Vestager, said a voluntary code of conduct for AI could be created \"within the next weeks\".\n\nSome fear that advanced computational ability could be used for harmful purposes, such as the development of deadly new chemical weapons.\n\nProf Bengio told the BBC he was concerned about \"bad actors\" getting hold of AI, especially as it became more sophisticated and powerful.\n\n\"It might be military, it might be terrorists, it might be somebody very angry, psychotic. And so if it's easy to program these AI systems to ask them to do something very bad, this could be very dangerous.\n\n\"If they're smarter than us, then it's hard for us to stop these systems or to prevent damage,\" he added.\n\nProf Bengio admitted those concerns were taking a personal toll on him, as his life's work, which had given him direction and a sense of identity, was no longer clear to him.\n\n\"It is challenging, emotionally speaking, for people who are inside [the AI sector],\" he said.\n\n\"You could say I feel lost. But you have to keep going and you have to engage, discuss, encourage others to think with you.\"\n\nThe Canadian has signed two recent statements urging caution about the future risks of AI. Some academics and industry experts have warned that the pace of development could result in malicious AI being deployed by \"bad actors\" to actively cause harm - or choosing to inflict harm by itself.\n\nFellow \"godfather\" Dr Geoffrey Hinton has also signed the same warnings as Prof Bengio, and retired from Google recently saying he regretted his work.\n\nThe third \"godfather\", Prof Yann LeCun, who along with Prof Bengio and Dr Hinton won a prestigious Turing Award for their pioneering work, has said apocalyptic warnings are overblown.\n\nTwitter and Tesla owner Elon Musk has also voiced his concerns.\n\n\"I don't think AI will try to destroy humanity, but it might put us under strict controls,\" he said recently at an event hosted by the Wall Street Journal.\n\n\"There's a small likelihood of it annihilating humanity. Close to zero but not impossible.\"\n\nProf Bengio told the BBC all companies building powerful AI products needed to be registered.\n\n\"Governments need to track what they're doing, they need to be able to audit them, and that's just the minimum thing we do for any other sector like building aeroplanes or cars or pharmaceuticals,\" he said.\n\n\"We also need the people who are close to these systems to have a kind of certification... we need ethical training here. Computer scientists don't usually get that, by the way.\"\n\nBut not everybody in the field believes AI will be the downfall of humans - others argue that there are more imminent problems which need addressing.\n\nDr Sasha Luccioni, research scientist at the AI firm Huggingface, said society should focus on issues like AI bias, predictive policing, and the spread of misinformation by chatbots which she said were \"very concrete harms\".\n\n\"We should focus on that rather than the hypothetical risk that AI will destroy humanity,\" she added.\n\nThere are already many examples of AI bringing benefits to society. Last week an AI tool discovered a new antibiotic, and a paralysed man was able to walk again just by thinking about it, thanks to a microchip developed using AI.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Three young men were inside.\n\nThe officers told the driver to stop but the vehicle pulled away, ignoring the red light. The officers gave chase and notified their unit by radio.\n\nAt 08:16, the Mercedes stopped in heavy traffic. Both officers got off their motorcycles, drew their weapons and approached the car.\n\nThey later told prosecutors that they pointed their guns at the driver to \"deter him from driving away again\".\n\nThey asked the driver to turn off the ignition, but the car moved forward. One of the officers fired, fatally wounding the young man in the chest.\n\nAfter the car ran into a roadside barrier, one of the passengers was arrested and the other fled on foot.\n\nThe passenger says the three friends were driving around Nanterre when the car strayed into the bus lane and was chased by two policemen on motorcycles.\n\nAfter Nahel stopped the car, the young man says in his video and in an interview with Le Parisien newspaper, one of the officers hit the teenage driver with the butt of his gun.\n\nHe alleges that the second policeman also struck Nahel before the first officer again hit him.\n\nHe told Le Parisien that the blows left Nahel M \"a little stunned\".\n\nThe third blow, according to this account, caused Nahel to take his foot off the brake and the vehicle to move forward. After the officer fired, Nahel M slumped forward and his foot pressed on the accelerator, the passenger said.\n\nWhen the car came a standstill, the passenger said, he decided to flee because he was afraid he would be shot too.\n\nQuestions have been asked about the car, a Mercedes A class AMG. Officials describe it as a rented vehicle.\n\nThe passenger who fled said that someone had lent it to the three youths, without giving any details.\n\nAccording to the French motoring website Autoplus, German sportscars with Polish number plates can be hired for \u20ac300-3,000 (\u00a3260-2,600) a day.\n\nThis type of short rental is popular with young men in French housing estates, Autoplus says.\n\nNahel M did not have a criminal record but was known to police.\n\nHe had previously been cited for driving without a licence - he was too young to have one - and for refusing to comply with an order to stop.\n\nHe was due to appear before a juvenile court in September.", "Blume said banning books \"has become political... it's worse than it was in the 80s\"\n\nAuthor Judy Blume has said she is worried about intolerance in the US, after some of her novels were removed from schools.\n\nSome books have been removed from school libraries in the US due to concerns about how they explore complex themes of sex, race or gender identity.\n\nOne of Blume's novels was recently pulled in a Florida school district.\n\nBlume told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg banning books \"has become political... it's worse than it was in the 80s\".\n\nAsked if she was worried about intolerance in the US, she replied: \"Absolutely, intolerance about everything, gender, sexuality, racism.\n\n\"It's just reaching a point where again we have to fight back, we have to stand up and fight.\"\n\nBlume's novels have been translated into 32 languages and sold more than 90 million copies, according to recent figures reported by The Washington Post.\n\nA screen adaptation of the author's 1970 novel Are You There God?

whose chorus is sung in Ukrainian as a message of solidarity with their war-torn European neighbour.\n\nDressed in blush-pink suits, with floor-length ponytails, the band are mobbed by fans when they arrive in the Eurovision press centre. After posing for an endless succession of Instagram photos, TikTok video and BeReal snaps, they sit down to discuss their Eurovision experience.\n\nYou've just been mobbed! Is that happening everywhere now?\n\nPatricie: Yes! It still feels a bit crazy. But we're just so happy that our message is being understood. That's what Eurovision is about. So, when the fans come and they love the song, we couldn't be more grateful.\n\nHow has the whole rehearsal and semi-final process been?\n\nPatricie: It's really fine. We feel rooted on the stage and we feel calm. I think we're ready for the final.\n\nHow strange is it to be dancing instead of playing your instruments on stage?\n\nOlesya: It's very strange - because until recently we pretended to play the instruments on stage and it was like, where's the sound? [The technical complexity of Eurovision means that all songs are sung to a backing track]. But now, as we are all dancing, we can express our emotions through our movements.\n\nThis YouTube post cannot be displayed in your browser. Please enable Javascript or try a different browser.

I'll stay hidden behind the kit.\"\n\nTanita: Fortunately, our drummer has great moves, so we have no problem.\n\nPatricie: We always say how funny that our first public dance performance will be watched by 60 million people and our second, in the final, will be watched by 200 million. For beginners, that's pretty good!\n\nYou're rocking these incredible floor-length braids, which are part of your dance routine.\n\nTanita; We call it hair-ography! We've been practicing for three months.\n\nHas anyone tripped up yet?\n\nPatricie: No, we have carefully planned the plaits not to be longer than our ankles. Of course, tripping over has happened in our nightmares, but it hasn't happened in real life. And It won't happen.\n\nThe band's performance was a fan favourite in the Liverpool Arena at Tuesday's semi-final\n\nMy Sister's Crown is a really powerful song. Can you tell us a bit about the lyrics?\n\nPatricie: Our message is to stand up for those people who are being put down or being stepped on. If you see somebody being pushed into the corner, or having their crown taken away, we feel it's wrong.\n\nSo it has a message of empowerment - which you can see in our sisterhood. But can also apply to a community or a country that is going through a hard time.\n\nWhen you sing the chorus in Ukrainian, it's a really powerful statement.\n\nPatricie: That's correct. When we sing, \"we stand for you\" in Ukrainian, we are supporting that Slavic country with a message from all the other Slavic counties.\n\nThere's a feminine principle of solidarity and empathy with other, and when you see that basic human rights are being neglected, it's just so painful.\n\nYou've been playing together since 2016. How has the band developed?\n\nTanita: We all met in music school in Prague in the Czech Republic, but we all come from different countries.\n\nPatricie: We've already released two albums at home, and the music usually depicts what we are going through as a band, as women. The more mature we get, we see world in a different way, so every record reflects that growth and I think with time it's getting more and more polished.\n\nSo for example, right now, with the opportunity of having our music exposed to the whole world, we decided to create an EP which is combining other Slavic languages.\n\nI heard a rumour it will be released on Sunday...\n\nPatricie: Yeah, it comes out one day after Eurovision.\n\nThe group have already released two albums, toured with Aurora and collaborated with Hradec Kralove's Philharmonic Orchestra\n\nCzechia's best result in Eurovision is sixth place but there's speculation that you might improve on that. Does that get into your head?\n\nPatricie: Every time when we go on a stage, a few moments before we begin, we just make a circle and we remind each other, \"This is not about us being perfect. It's not about worrying about making mistakes or not making mistakes.\" We're really here to spread a message and that has already happened.\n\nSo if people love it and if they understand it - if it touches their heart - then that's our victory.\n\nPatricie, I know you're a huge Taylor Swift fan... What would you do if she called up to ask for a collaboration?\n\nPatricie: Oh my God. You don't want me into your microphone but, 'Aaaaaaaaaaah'! For sure she could come along. She's a genius songwriter. I don't understand how she manages to write two albums in one year!\n\nTo be fair, that was in lockdown. We all had a lot of time on our hands.\n\nPatricie: That's true. But again, I think we also did a good job of staying creative during Eurovision. We recorded three new songs in the last two months and you can hear them on the EP. So we are in Taylor's shadow but it's a good shadow to be in.", "Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg announced the plans in a memo to staff\n\nMeta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, has announced plans to cut 10,000 jobs.\n\nIt will be the second wave of mass redundancies from the tech giant, which laid off 11,000 employees last November.\n\nMeta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said the cuts - part of a \"year of efficiency\" - would be \"tough\".\n\nIn addition to the 10,000 jobs cut, 5,000 vacancies at the firm will be left unfilled, he told staff.\n\nIn a memo, Mr Zuckerberg told employees he believed the company had suffered \"a humbling wake-up call\" in 2022 when it experienced a dramatic slowdown in revenue.\n\nMeta previously announced that in the three months to December 2022, earnings were down 4% year-on-year - though it still managed to make a profit of more than $23bn over the course of 2022.\n\nMr Zuckerberg cited higher interest rates in the US, global geopolitical instability and increased regulation as some of the factors affecting Meta, and contributing to the slowdown.\n\n\"I think we should prepare ourselves for the possibility that this new economic reality will continue for many years,\" he said.\n\nThe latest job cuts come as companies, including Google and Amazon, have been grappling with how to balance cost-cutting measures with the need to remain competitive.\n\nAt the start of this year, Amazon announced it planned to close more than 18,000 jobs because of \"the uncertain economy\" and rapid hiring during the pandemic, while Google's parent company Alphabet made 12,000 cuts.\n\nAccording to layoffs.fyi, which tracks job losses in the tech sector, there have been more than 128,000 job cuts in the tech industry so far in 2023.\n\nMr Zuckerberg said the recruitment team would be the first to be told whether they were affected by the cuts, and would find out on Wednesday.\n\nHe also outlined when other teams would be informed: \"We expect to announce restructurings and lay-offs in our tech groups in late April 2023, and then our business groups in late May 2023,\" he wrote in the memo to staff on Tuesday.\n\n\"In a small number of cases, it may take through to the end of the year to complete these changes.\n\n\"Our timelines for international teams will also look different, and local leaders will follow up with more details.\"\n\nSadly, we're getting used to hearing about big tech lay-offs, as the giants of the sector continue to tighten their belts.\n\nMany like Meta make most of their money from advertising. Now they're faced with a perfect storm: of falling ad revenues from companies with their own bills to pay, and a user base which has less money to spend, making existing ad space less valuable.\n\nIt's interesting to note that Meta is looking to its recruitment team in the latest round of cuts.\n\nI often hear that Silicon Valley firms have a tendency to over-recruit, for two reasons. Firstly, so they have staff ready to handle sudden growth, which can happen (just look at TikTok). And, secondly, to retain those people perceived to be \"top tech talent\", whom they don't want working for their rivals.\n\nBoth are luxuries, it seems, that are no longer affordable.\n\nMeta has the added risk of Mark Zuckerberg's enormous gamble on the metaverse being The Next Big Thing. If he's right, his firm will regain its crown, but if he's wrong, the $15bn+ dollars he has spent on it so far could disappear in a puff of mixed reality smoke.\n\nMr Zuckerberg said there would be no new hires until the restructuring was complete, adding that he aimed to make the company \"flatter\" by \"removing multiple layers of management\".\n\nHe also dedicated a section of his correspondence to hybrid work. His claims that software engineers who joined Meta in person performed better than those who joined remotely, suggest hybrid working will come under scrutiny during the current \"year of efficiency\".\n\n\"Engineers earlier in their career perform better on average when they work in person with teammates at least three days a week,\" wrote Mr Zuckerberg.\n\n\"We're focusing on understanding this further, and finding ways to make sure people build the necessary connections to work effectively.\n\n\"In the meantime, I encourage all of you to find more opportunities to work with your colleagues in person.\"", "Mr Netanyahu was faced with protesters as he arrived at Downing Street\n\nAs Benjamin Netanyahu walked the length of Downing Street towards a warm welcome from Rishi Sunak, the sounds of anguished protest will have been ringing in his ears.\n\nIt's nothing he hasn't seen and heard, on a vastly bigger scale, on the streets of his own country in recent weeks.\n\nBut it will have served as a reminder that Israel's domestic woes are now following the embattled prime minister wherever he goes.\n\nThere is no obvious sign that it's causing difficulties in relations with the UK, though.\n\nIn a joint document signed by the British and Israeli foreign ministers on Tuesday, the two sides said their bilateral relationship \"has never been stronger\".\n\n\"As freedom-loving, innovative and thriving democracies,\" the document known as the 2030 Roadmap went on, \"Israel and the UK are proud of our deep and historic partnership. We are firm friends and natural allies.\"\n\nA Downing Street readout of Friday morning's meeting hints at some mild criticism from Rishi Sunak of Mr Netanyahu's proposed legal reforms.\n\n\"The prime minister stressed the importance of upholding the democratic values that underpin our relationship,\" a spokesperson said, \"including in the proposed judicial reforms in Israel.\"\n\nThe fact that cameras were not allowed into Number 10, and the absence of customary statements or a news conference, hinted at an air of embarrassment surrounding Mr Netanyahu's visit.\n\nBut outside, in Whitehall, Mr Netanyahu's British critics were rather more direct.\n\n\"For the first time in a really long time, British Jews are really taking a stand,\" Sharon Shochat, one of the organisers of today's protest, told the BBC.\n\n\"We don't want anything to do with what we're seeing in Israel. The racism, the extremism, the deterioration from democracy and liberal values.\"\n\nNeither Ms Shochat nor the tens of thousands of Israelis demonstrating on the streets of Israel for the past two months can necessarily claim to represent a majority opinion, but this is a moment of doubt and anxiety for the Jewish state's supporters abroad, as they watch Israelis coming to blows.\n\nBritain's Chief Rabbi, Sir Ephraim Mirvis, was sufficiently alarmed to issue a plea for Jewish unity, while urging Israel to \"hold fast to the principles upon which it was founded\".\n\nOf more concern, for Israel, are signs that the US administration is losing patience with its traditional ally.\n\nLast week the Biden administration took the highly unusual step of calling the Israeli ambassador to the state department to explain why his government was planning to undo part of a 2005 law on settlements withdrawal, which could see Jewish settlers returning to highly contentious sites in the occupied West Bank.\n\nAnd it's notable that Joe Biden, long regarded as a firm friend of Israel, has yet to invite Mr Netanyahu to the White House.", "Deputy PM Dominic Raab has paid his own legal fees during an investigation into allegations he bullied officials.\n\nMr Raab's spokesman said it was \"not an option\" for his legal representation to be paid by the government.\n\nThis is despite taxpayers footing the bill for Boris Johnson's lawyers in the Partygate inquiry, which so far runs to \u00a3220,000.\n\nDowning Street is facing questions about why Mr Johnson is getting government support.\n\nRishi Sunak's spokesman said the former prime minister was being investigated over government business when he was a minister.\n\nHe argued that this was different to Mr Raab's case and meant that Mr Johnson was entitled to government support under an \"established process\".\n\nThe PM's spokesman denied both men were being investigated over their behaviour and were therefore subject to the same rules.\n\nMr Johnson - whose legal team is headed by top barrister Lord Pannick KC - is facing claims he deliberately lied to Parliament over Covid-rule breaking in Downing Street when he was prime minister.\n\nThe Commons Privileges Committee is currently deciding whether he is guilty of a contempt of Parliament. Mr Johnson was last month grilled for nearly four hours by the committee, with a lawyer at his side.\n\nMr Raab is under investigation over eight formal complaints about his behaviour as foreign secretary, Brexit secretary and during his first stint as justice secretary.\n\nHe has denied allegations of bullying and said he has always \"behaved professionally\" - but has previously said he would resign if the inquiry finds against him.\n\nThe bullying probe is being carried out by lawyer Adam Tolley KC, who was appointed by Mr Sunak in November.\n\nMr Tolley's report is expected to land on the prime minister's desk shortly. He will then decide - based on the evidence in it - whether Mr Raab has broken the ministerial code and must be sacked.\n\nNews that Mr Raab had paid for his own legal advice was included in a much-delayed update to the register of ministerial interests, published by the government in the wake of controversy over Mr Sunak's financial transparency.\n\nMr Raab's entry in the register reads: \"The minister has engaged lawyers at his own expense in relation to the investigation being conducted by Adam Tolley KC.\"\n\nMinisters are meant to register shareholdings, directorships, investments or any other financial arrangement that could lead to a conflict of interest.\n\nIt is unusual for a minister to declare an expense on the register, as Mr Raab has done.\n\nA Cabinet Office source said ministers can also use the register to declare \"anything that is relevant to their work as a minister\".", "Last updated on .From the section Horse Racing\n\nPre-race favourite Kitty's Light burst clear of the field despite making a mistake over the last fence to win the Scottish Grand National at Ayr.\n\nIt started a couple of minutes late after police stopped an attempt by protestors to disrupt the showpiece.\n\nJockey Jack Tudor brought home the 4-1 Welsh-trained horse, who was runner-up last year, ahead of Scotland's Cooper's Cross (25-1) in second.\n\nFlash De Touzaine was third at 40-1, while Threeunderthrufive was fourth.\n\nTudor dedicated the win to trainer Christian Williams, whose five-year-old daughter Betsy was recently diagnosed with leukaemia.\n\n\"This means an awful lot to Christian - his little girl's really unwell,\" he said. \"It has been a massive lift to him more than anyone. It means a lot this one.\"\n\nWilliams was understandably emotional after the race, saying: \"It's brilliant. He's a very important horse. We've a big battle on at home with my daughter, but this is great and will cheer everyone up.\n\n\"I'm lucky to have the staff I've got, and the family. It's a great tonic to the children watching at home and I'm looking forward to getting back tonight and seeing them all.\"\n\nSeven-year-old Kitty's Light was well backed to triumph over the four-mile course and its 25 fences despite what Tudor described as the horse's obvious limitations.\n\nHe said: \"He's very different. He's small, he's Flat-bred, he's not a brilliant jumper, but he's just trained to the absolute minute.\"\n\nKitty's Light hit the top of the last fence hard as Tudor moved him to the front of the field, but he maintained momentum to hold off a strong run from home hope Cooper's Cross.\n\nThe field showed little tension early on after attempts by protest group Animal Rising to disrupt the start, as they had at the previous Saturday's Grand National at Aintree.\n\nThere was a significant security operation by Police Scotland, which reported that a small number of people had been arrested, but protestors who made it on to the track were quickly dealt with.\n\nThe Ayr protest followed the death of horse Oscar Elite in the 13:50 race on Saturday. Activists said they wanted to stop other horses from dying or coming to harm.\n\u2022 None Follow the Highland Cops as they fight crime", "Dame Jenny Harries was seen by ministers as a safe pair of hands during the pandemic and was never likely to be the most outspoken of witnesses in this inquiry.\n\nToday she kept coming back to what she described as \"wicked\" issues - those questions that are particularly hard to grapple with and no obvious right answer.\n\nWhether to put in place mandatory quarantine for travellers arriving in the country or voluntary self-isolation was, she said, a \"very difficult\" decision where the \"evidence base is often in the opposite direction to political will.\"\n\nUnlike other witnesses, she said basing pandemic planning on an outbreak of a new flu virus was \"a pretty good\" strategy.\n\nShe did though suggest a better idea would be to have a plan which could \"flex\" and adapt quickly to the specific attributes of a future virus if and when it emerges.\n\nHarries said she would agree with the overall conclusions of a report finding that Covid hit the most vulnerable in society the hardest.\n\nBut she was very careful not to criticise the economic policies of the government since 2010, saying there was \"no evidence\" of a direct link between austerity and the impact of the pandemic.\n\nFinally she appeared to support calls for a new senior minister to be appointed to be in charge of resilience and emergency planning in the future (another of her \"wicked\" issues).", "British attempts to evacuate its embassy staff from Sudan at the weekend delayed efforts by other countries to rescue their own citizens, senior German political sources have told the BBC.\n\nThey allege British forces landed in Sudan without the Sudanese army's permission - as other European nations were hoping to airlift citizens to safety.\n\nThe UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) described that as \"complete nonsense\".\n\nGermany, among others, had planned to use the airfield north of Khartoum from which subsequent evacuation operations have been conducted.\n\nBut, the sources say, the \"unannounced British military presence\" so angered the Sudanese army that they refused access to the facility.\n\nAccording to one source, having landed without permission, the British had to pay the army before leaving.\n\nAnd negotiations to use the airfield meant that German rescuers \"lost at least half a day\" during what was, at the time, considered to be a very small window of opportunity.\n\nThe MoD denied that it was responsible for any delay.\n\nIn a statement, it said: \"It is not accurate to suggest that Britain's efforts to evacuate embassy staff from Sudan last weekend slowed-down Germany's plans.\n\n\"Operating in such complex circumstances will always come with challenges, but we have worked extremely closely with our French, US and particularly German partners who have facilitated access to the airfield throughout this week, and of course we remain grateful to the Sudanese Armed Forces.\"\n\nLater, an MoD spokesperson said it was \"complete nonsense to claim that we landed in Sudan without permission from the Sudanese army. We had permission\".\n\nGermany has now ended its rescue mission, after airlifting more than 700 people to safety on six flights from the airfield north of Khartoum which the UK is now using for its evacuation operation.\n\nAround 200 of those taken to safety were German nationals and the rest were from 30 other nations, including the UK.\n\nThe relief and elation in Berlin that its operation concluded relatively successfully has assuaged the anger of defence officials, but military leaders are still said to be \"not amused\".\n\nWhen asked why the UK had managed to get its embassy staff out on Saturday, while German flights only started on Sunday, Mr Pistorius said: \"How shall I put it diplomatically? They ignored what the Sudanese had stipulated.\"\n\nAnd, in Berlin, there are lingering traces of disdain for the UK government's initial handling of the crisis.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock may not have mentioned the UK by name but launched a thinly disguised attack on countries that, she implied, had abandoned their citizens and focused their rescue efforts only on diplomatic staff.\n\n\"It was important to us that the [German] evacuation, unlike other countries, didn't just involve our diplomatic personnel but all Germans on the ground and their partners.\"", "Delyth Jones said having migraines affects her life \"massively\"\n\nA woman who has about nine migraines a month has said the condition controls her life.\n\nDelyth Jones, 32, from Ceredigion, said she has missed her children's school concerts and sports days due to them.\n\nA former GP who lost her job after a chronic migraine diagnosis has set up a voluntary support group in Cardiff, citing a lack of support.\n\nThe Welsh government said it was committed to improving care and services.\n\nMs Jones first started having migraines as a teenager and described the pain as \"intense\".\n\n\"It starts as a little tingling behind my eye, and I think 'oh yes, I'm going to have a migraine today',\" she said.\n\n\"[It's] a huge pressure running back towards the back of my head from my eye.

This is why we continue to invest in our Detect Cancer Earlier (DCE) Programme, which adopts a whole systems approach to diagnosing and treating cancer as early as possible.\n\n\"Public awareness campaigns and messaging have run throughout the pandemic to encourage those with possible cancer symptoms to seek help.\n\nHe added a new public awareness campaign, Be the Early Bird, was launched earlier this month.\n\nThe spokesman said: \"This campaign has targeted areas of deprivation to reduce the inequalities gap.\n\n\"We are also committed to ensuring equitable access to early diagnosis which is why we continue to invest in our Rapid Cancer Diagnostic Services across Scotland, with three live and a further two coming on stream in the next few weeks.\"", "Different areas of the church were targeted\n\nA historic 17th Century church in South Ayrshire has been defaced with \"mindless\" vandalism.\n\nThe Auld Kirk of Ayr was targeted on Thursday night with explicit graffiti spray-painted on the windows, door and gravestones.\n\nThe Church of Scotland site dates back to 1654 and Scotland's national bard Robert Burns worshipped there for 17 years.\n\nPolice said the damage amounted to thousands of pounds.\n\nReverend David Gemmell said South Ayrshire Council had cleaned the worst of the graffiti off before the church service takes place on Sunday.\n\n\"It's just mindless vandalism,\" he said. \"I've been here for 25 years and this is the first and hopefully last time something like this has happened.\n\n\"It's very disappointing.

The US and Germany - which account for the vast majority of Israel's arms imports - both voted against. Germany said it did so because the resolution did not explicitly condemn Hamas.\n\nThe war was triggered by Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October, which killed about 1,200 people, mainly civilians, according Israeli tallies. More than 33,000 people have been killed in Gaza, 70% of them children and women, the Hamas-run health ministry says.\n\nIsrael insists that its forces are working to avoid civilian casualties, accuses Hamas of deliberately putting civilians in the line of fire and has said there are no limits on aid deliveries.\n\nThe US is by far the biggest supplier of arms to Israel, having helped it build one of the most technologically sophisticated militaries in the world.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), the US accounted for 69% of Israel's arms imports between 2019 and 2023.\n\nThe US provides Israel with $3.8bn (\u00a33bn) in annual military aid under a 10-year agreement that is intended to allow its ally to maintain what it calls a \"qualitative military edge\" over neighbouring countries.\n\nIsrael has used the grants to finance orders of F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, a stealth aircraft considered the most advanced ever made. It has so far ordered 75 and taken delivery of more than 30 of the aircraft. It was the first country other than the US to receive an F-35 and the first to use one in combat.\n\nPart of the aid - $500m annually - is set aside to fund missile defence programmes, including the jointly developed Iron Dome, Arrow and David's Sling systems. Israel has relied on them during the war to defend itself against rocket, missile and drone attacks by Palestinian armed groups in Gaza, as well as other Iran-backed armed groups based in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq.\n\nIn the days after Hamas's 7 October attack, President Joe Biden said the US was \"surging additional military assistance\" to Israel.\n\nSince the start of the war, only two US military sales to Israel have been made public after receiving emergency approval - one for 14,000 rounds of tank ammunition worth $106m and the other for $147m of components to make 155mm artillery shells.\n\nBut US media report that President Joe Biden's administration has also quietly made more than 100 military sales to Israel, most falling below the dollar amount that would require Congress to be formally notified. They are said to include thousands of precision-guided munitions, small-diameter bombs, bunker busters and small arms.\n\nIsrael's Iron Dome batteries help protect cities and towns from rocket and missile fire\n\nHowever, SIPRI's report says that despite the deliveries, the total volume of Israeli arms imports from the US in 2023 was almost the same as in 2022.\n\nOne deal that is large enough to require Congressional notification is the $18bn sale of up to 50 F-15 fighter jets, news about which emerged this week. Congress has not yet approved the deal.\n\nEven though the aircraft would need to be built from scratch and would not be delivered immediately, the sale is expected to be hotly debated by Mr Biden's Democratic Party, many of whose representatives in Congress and supporters are increasingly concerned by Israel's actions in Gaza.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren has said she is prepared to block the deal and has accused Israel of \"indiscriminate bombing\" in Gaza.\n\nGermany is the next biggest arms exporter to Israel, accounting for 30% of imports between 2019 and 2023, according to SIPRI.\n\nAs of early November, the European nation's weapons sales to Israel last year were worth \u20ac300m ($326m; $257m) - a 10-fold increase compared with 2022 - with the majority of those export licences granted after the 7 October attacks.\n\nComponents for air defence systems and communications equipment accounted for most of the sales, according to the DPA news agency.\n\nChancellor Olaf Scholz has been a staunch supporter of Israel's right to self-defence throughout the war and, although his tone on Israeli actions in Gaza has shifted in recent weeks and there has been some debate in Germany, the arms sales do not appear to be at risk of suspension.\n\nIsrael rejects accusations that it is failing to do enough to protect civilians in Gaza and instead blames Hamas\n\nItaly is the third-biggest arms exporter to Israel, but it accounted for only 0.9% of Israeli imports between 2019 and 2023. They have reportedly included helicopters and naval artillery.\n\nThe sales amounted to \u20ac13.7m ($14.8m; \u00a311.7m) last year, according to national statistics bureau ISTAT.\n\nSome \u20ac2.1m of exports were approved between October and December, despite the government's assurances that it was blocking them under a law which bans weapons sales to countries that are waging war or are deemed to be violating human rights.\n\nDefence Minister Guido Crosetto told parliament last month that Italy had honoured existing contracts after checking them on a case-by-case basis and ensuring \"they did not concern materials that could be used against civilians\".\n\nThe UK's arms exports to Israel are \"relatively small\", according to the UK government, amounting to only \u00a342m ($53m) in 2022.\n\nThe Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT) says that since 2008, the UK has granted arms export licences to Israel worth \u00a3574m ($727m) in total.\n\nMuch of those are for components used in US-made warplanes that end up in Israel. But the British government is coming under growing pressure to suspend even those exports.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak has said the UK has a \"very careful export licensing regime\" and said Israel must \"act in accordance with international humanitarian law\". The UK government is also preparing an assessment that will advise on the risk of Israel breaching international law in its actions from early 2024.\n\nBut a senior government source told the BBC that an arms embargo on Israel was \"not going to happen\".\n\nThe government of Canada, whose arms sales to Israel were worth 21.3m Canadian dollars ($15.7m; \u00a312.4m) in 2022, said in January that it had suspended approving new exit permits for weapons until it could ensure they were being used in accordance with Canadian law. However, pre-existing permits remained valid.\n\nIsrael's Elbit Systems developed the Hermes 450 unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) being used in Gaza\n\nIsrael has also built up its own defence industry with US help and now ranks as the ninth-largest arms exporter in the world, with a focus on advanced technological products rather than large-scale hardware.\n\nIt held a 2.3% share of global sales between 2019 and 2023, according to SIPRI, with India (37%), the Philippines (12%) and the US (8.7%) the three main recipients. The sales were worth $12.5bn (\u00a39.9bn) in 2022, according to the Israeli defence ministry.\n\nUnmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) made up 25% of those exports, followed by missiles, rockets and air defence systems (19%) and radar and electronic warfare systems (13%), the ministry said.\n\nIn September, just before the war began, Germany agreed a $3.5bn deal with Israel to buy the sophisticated Arrow 3 missile defence system, which intercepts long-range ballistic missiles. The deal - Israel's largest-ever - had to be approved by the US because it jointly developed the system.\n\nThe US has reportedly allowed Israel to draw artillery shells from its reserve stockpile there\n\nIsrael is also home to a vast US arms depot set up in 1984 to pre-position supplies for its troops in case of a regional conflict, as well as to give Israel quick access to weapons in emergencies.\n\nThe Pentagon shipped about 300,000 155mm artillery shells from the War Reserve Stockpile Ammunition-Israel to Ukraine following the Russian invasion.\n\nStockpiled munitions at the depot have also reportedly been supplied to Israel since the start of the Gaza war.", "Last updated on .From the section Irish\n\nIt was special night with two special goals and Andy Ryan sent the home fans into raptures by curling into the top corner to give Larne a first-half lead.\n\nFallon levelled on 69 minutes with a bending 15-yard strike which also nestled in the top corner.\n\nThe Blues are six points clear in second as they chase a European place.\n\nA win would have sealed second place and European qualification for Linfield and that will be confirmed if Glentoran fail to beat Coleraine on Saturday.\n\nBut it was Larne's night - the title was clinched last week at Seaview but they were at home in front of a packed Inver Park with the presentation of the Gibson Cup after the game.\n\nFuad Sule, Micheal Glynn, Lee Bonis and Ryan sent early efforts off-target as the hosts made a bright start.\n\nBonis saw a shot saved by Chris Johns before the Blues threatened with Joel Cooper arrowing across goal and just wide.\n\nThe opener came on 39 minutes and it was a memorable goal as Ryan moved in from the right before curling the ball over Johns and into the net from 25 yards.\n\nCooper squandered a good chance to level before the break when the winger drilled a low shot straight at keeper Rohan Ferguson.\n\nBonis came so close to giving Larne the perfect start to the second half as the striker's header from a Glynn free-kick crashed against the crossbar.\n\nFallon equalised on 57 minutes with the midfielder moving through unchallenged before unleashing an unstoppable long-range shot beyond Ferguson.\n\nLarne almost regained the lead when Kyle McClean cleared off the line from a Millar header.\n\nAt the other end Sam Roscoe headed wide from a Niall Quinn corner while former Larne captain Jeff Hughes, who retired earlier this year because of injury, came on for the hosts in the dying seconds in an emotional final appearance for his hometown club.", "Victor Lee died from stab wounds, the Met Police said\n\nThree teenagers have been charged with the murder of 17-year-old Victor Lee, who was found dead in a canal in north-west London last Sunday.\n\nVictor's body was pulled from the Grand Union Canal after police were called to reports of a stabbing.

Belgorod has been targeted in recent weeks by a series of cross-border raids from Ukraine.\n\nHis whereabouts on Wednesday, however, were a mystery.\n\nRussia's official military TV channel Zvezda reported that he was \"alive but wounded\", citing information from the lower house of the Russian parliament.\n\nZvezda said the report rebuffed some social media reports that he had been killed. Ukrainian sources have referred to an unconfirmed attack on the Chechen Akhmat paramilitary in the coastal city of Prymorsk, a long way from the front line in the southern Zaporizhzhia region.\n\nRamzan Kadyrov then offered a big reward for help in finding his \"dear brother\", even going so far as to call for help from Ukrainian intelligence.\n\nHowever, Russian officials have since sought to quell reports of such a high-ranking commander being wounded.\n\nFellow MP Dmitry Kuznetsov quoted Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin as saying that he had just talked to Adam Delimkhanov and that he was \"alive and well\".\n\nHours later, the Chechen leader backtracked on his earlier comments, claiming that his close ally was \"not even wounded\" and accusing Ukrainians of lying.\n\n\"I knew this from the very beginning of the injection of fake news, but I decided to show everyone, primarily Ukrainians, to what degree their media have sunk,\" he said.\n\nHe published a video along with his comments that showed the two men with several aides in front of map, but BBC Verify has found a number of inconsistencies in the clip that indicate it may have been manipulated.\n\nSome of the audio of the Chechen leader was out of sync with his lip movements and some military analysts have suggested the map dates back to last year.\n\nDelimkhanov put out a message debunking rumours surrounding his health to his half-a-million followers on social media, and then on Thursday he reposted the Chechen leader's video.\n\nNevertheless, the MP's reported injuries did prompt Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov to say it was following events with great concern and awaiting clarification of what had happened.\n\nThe Kremlin has so far refrained from commenting on the fate of another leading military figure, Maj Gen Sergei Goryachev, who was reportedly killed in a missile strike on Monday.\n\nThe incident was widely reported in Russian media, citing popular military blogger Yuri Kotenok, but with no official confirmation.\n\nRussian-installed official Vladimir Rogov appeared to validate the report by offering his condolences to the general's family and friends.\n\nA number of Russian generals have been killed since the start of the full-scale invasion, but if confirmed, Goryachev is thought to be the first such fatality for a year.", "An Italian tourist has been killed and seven other people injured in a suspected car-ramming attack near a beach in Tel Aviv, Israeli medics say.\n\nItaly's foreign minister said Israel had identified the man killed as Italian citizen Alessandro Parini, 36.\n\nA doctor told Israeli television the wounded included three British nationals and one other Italian.\n\nFootage from the scene showed an overturned car near a promenade and an Israeli police officer opening fire.\n\nLocal police said the suspected attacker was shot dead by officers.\n\nPolice have named him as Yousef Abu Jaber from Kafr Qasim, an Israeli-Arab city.\n\nThe attack came after two British-Israeli sisters were killed and their mother injured in a shooting in the occupied West Bank earlier on Friday.\n\nPolice in Tel Aviv said at 21:25 local time (19:25 BST) a 45-year-old man drove a Kia car along the city's beachside boardwalk, hitting several pedestrians before overturning on the lawn of the Charles Clore Garden.\n\nThey said a police officer at a nearby petrol station heard the commotion and, after running to the scene, saw the driver of the car \"trying to reach for what looked like a rifle-like object that was with him\" and then \"neutralised him\".\n\nThe Israeli ambulance service said that, aside from the alleged perpetrator, there were a total of eight casualties from the attack and that all were tourists.\n\nOf those wounded, three suffered moderate injuries and four sustained only light injuries, it said.\n\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni expressed her \"deep sorrow\" at Mr Parini's death and described the attack as \"cowardly\".\n\nThe UK Minister for the Middle East and North Africa Lord Ahmad condemned the attacks and confirmed British nationals were injured in the car-ramming incident in Tel Aviv.\n\nFollowing the attack, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu mobilised police and army reservists as part of efforts to counter terrorism.\n\nMr Netanyahu has also visited the site of the shooting in the West Bank.\n\nThe attacks in the West Bank took place hours after the Israeli military carried out air strikes on targets belonging to the Palestinian militant group Hamas in southern Lebanon and the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe military said the strikes were a response to a barrage of 34 rockets fired from Lebanon into northern Israel on Thursday, which it blamed on the group.\n\nTensions are running high following two nights of Israeli police raids at Jerusalem's al-Aqsa mosque -

Hema Purohit, who leads on digital health and social care for the BCS, said the technology was enabling new ways to spot serious illness, for example medical systems that detect signs of issues such as cardiac disease or diabetes when a patient goes for an eye test.\n\nShe said AI could also help accelerate the testing of new drugs.\n\nSignatory Sarah Burnett, author of a book on AI and business, pointed to agricultural uses of the tech, from robots that use artificial intelligence to pollinate plants to those that \"identify weeds and spray or zap them with lasers, rather than having whole crops sprayed with weed killer\".\n\nThe letter argues: \"The UK can help lead the way in setting professional and technical standards in AI roles, supported by a robust code of conduct, international collaboration and fully resourced regulation\".\n\nBy doing so, it says Britain \"can become a global byword for high-quality, ethical, inclusive AI\".\n\nIn the autumn UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will host a global summit on AI regulation.\n\nWhile the BCS may argue existential threats are sci-fi, some issues are just over the horizon or are already presenting problems.\n\nIt has been predicted that the equivalent of up to 300 million jobs could be automated, and some companies have already said they will pause hiring in some roles as a result of AI.\n\nBut Mr Carter thinks AI - rather than replacing humans - will boost their productivity. In his own work he says ChatGPT is useful, but he says he is wary of putting too much trust in it, comparing it to a \"very knowledgeable and a very excitable, 12-year-old\".\n\nHe argues companies will always need to have humans involved in the workplace, to take responsibility if things go wrong: \"If you take the human completely out of the loop, how do you manage accountability for some sort of catastrophic event happening?\"\n\nHe, like other signatories, believes regulation will be needed to avoid the misuse of AI.\n\nMs Purohit says a motive for signing was the need for rules to \"make sure that we don't just run off and create lots and lots of things without paying attention to the testing and the governance, and the assurance that sits behind it\".", "Virgin Money will close 39 of its UK banks as fewer people use bricks and mortar branches and move to online banking, the firm said.\n\nThe news comes after several High Street banks including Lloyds and Halifax have shut branches.\n\nThe Unite union said \"access to a bank and cash is a fundamental need\" for local High Streets.\n\nVirgin Money said the closures amount to a third of its banks and 255 workers will be at risk of redundancy.\n\nChief operating officer Sarah Wilkinson said the firm would \"pursue all options\" to retain as many staff as possible within alternative roles.\n\nThe banks that will close are: Belfast, Croydon, Harrow, Newton Stewart, Bournemouth, Derby, Hexham, Norwich, Brighton, Durham, Irvine, Oxford, Bristol, Ellon, Kendal, Reading, Bromley, Enfield, Kensington, Southampton, Cambridge, Exeter, Kingston, St Albans, Cardiff, Fort William, Liverpool, Swindon, Chelmsford, Golders Green, Lochgilphead, Turriff, Cheltenham, Gosforth Centre, London Haymarket, Wolverhampton, Chester, Guildford and Milton Keynes.\n\nLast year, Lloyds Banking Group said it would close 66 branches between October 2022 and January 2023.\n\nIn a further announcement in January, the group said Halifax would close 18 sites, while Lloyds would shut another 22 between April and June.\n\nBut closures have led to cash shortages in some instances. When Lloyds Bank in Herefordshire closed traders were forced to travel miles with their takings.\n\n\"The number of customers using bank branches for day-to-day transactions has been on a downward trajectory for a number of years,\" Virgin Money said. It added that the branches closing had seen a reduction of 43% in customer transaction volumes.\n\nSome 96% of customers use the branches less than once a month, it added.\n\n\"Each store closing is less than half a mile from the nearest Post Office, which customers can use to carry out day\u2010to-day transactions,\" Virgin Money said.\n\nIn May, Age UK said older or vulnerable people could struggle with online banking and called for more \"banking hubs\", which are spaces shared by several High Street lenders, meant to help communities that have seen all their bank branches close.\n\nVirgin Money said that after the closures it would have a network of 91 stores across the UK.", "A mysterious flash which lit up skies over Ukraine's capital on Wednesday night generated much speculation.\n\nOfficials in Kyiv initially suspected it was a Nasa satellite falling to Earth but the US space agency told the BBC it was still in orbit.\n\nUkrainian space officials said later the flash had probably come from a meteorite entering the atmosphere.", "In March last year a video appeared to show President Volodymyr Zelensky telling the people of Ukraine to lay down their arms and surrender to Russia.\n\nIt was a pretty obvious deepfake - a type of fake video that uses artificial intelligence to swap faces or create a digital version of someone.\n\nBut as AI developments make deepfakes easier to produce, detecting them quickly has become all the more important.\n\nIntel believes it has a solution, and it is all about blood in your face.\n\nThe company has named the system \"FakeCatcher\".\n\nIn Intel's plush, and mostly empty, offices in Silicon Valley we meet Ilke Demir, research scientist at Intel Labs, who explains how it works.\n\n\"We ask what is real about authentic videos? What is real about us? What is the watermark of being human?\" she says.\n\nCentral to the system is a technique called Photoplethysmography (PPG), which detects changes in blood flow.\n\nFaces created by deepfakes don't give out these signals, she says.\n\nThe system also analyses eye movement to check for authenticity.\n\n\"So normally, when humans look at a point, when I look at you, it's as if I'm shooting rays from my eyes, to you. But for deepfakes, it's like googly eyes, they are divergent,\" she says.\n\nBy looking at both these traits, Intel believes it can work out the difference between a real video and a fake within seconds.\n\nThe company claims FakeCatcher is 96% accurate. So we asked to try out the system. Intel agreed.\n\nWe used a dozen or so clips of former US President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden.\n\nSome were real, some were deepfakes created by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: The BBC's James Clayton puts a deepfake video detector to the test\n\nIn terms of finding the deepfakes, the system appeared to be pretty good.\n\nWe mostly chose lip-synced fakes - real videos where the mouth and voice had been altered.\n\nAnd it got every answer right, bar one.\n\nHowever when we got onto real, authentic videos it started to have a problem.\n\nSeveral times the system said a video was fake, when it was in fact real.\n\nThe more pixelated a video, the harder it is to pick up blood flow.\n\nThe system also does not analyse audio. So some videos that seemed fairly obviously real by listening to the voice were allocated as fake.\n\nThe worry is that if the program says a video is fake, when it's genuine, it could cause real problems.\n\nWhen we make this point to Ms Demir, she says that \"verifying something as fake, versus 'be careful, this may be fake' is weighted differently\".\n\nShe is saying the system is being overly cautious. Better to catch all the fakes - and catch some real videos too - than miss fakes.\n\nDeepfakes can be incredibly subtle: a two second clip in a political campaign advert, for example. They can also be of low quality. A fake can be made by only changing the voice.\n\nIn this respect, the ability for FaceCatcher to work \"in the wild\" - in real world contexts - has been questioned.\n\nMatt Groh is an assistant professor at Northwestern University in Illinois, and a deepfakes expert.\n\n\"I don't doubt the stats that they listed in their initial evaluation,\" he says. \"But what I do doubt is whether the stats are relevant to real world contexts.\"\n\nThis is where it gets difficult to evaluate FakeCatcher's tech.\n\nProgrammes like facial-recognition systems will often give extremely generous statistics for their accuracy.\n\nHowever, when actually tested in the real world they can be less accurate.\n\nEarlier this year the BBC tested Clearview AI's facial recognition system, using our own pictures. Although the power of the tech was impressive, it was also clear that the more pixelated the picture, and the more side-on the the face in the photo was, the harder it was for the programme to successfully identify someone.\n\nIn essence, the accuracy is entirely dependent on the difficulty of the test.\n\nIntel claims that FakeCatcher has gone through rigorous testing. This includes a \"wild\" test - in which the company has put together 140 fake videos - and their real counterparts.\n\nIn this test the system had a success rate of 91%, Intel says.\n\nHowever, Matt Groh and other researchers want to see the system independently analysed. They do not think it's good enough that Intel is setting a test for itself.\n\n\"I would love to evaluate these systems,\" Mr Groh says.\n\n\"I think it's really important when we're designing audits and trying to understand how accurate something is in a real world context,\" he says.\n\nIt is surprising how difficult it can be tell a fake and a real video apart - and this technology certainly has potential.\n\nBut from our limited tests, it has a way to go yet.\n\nWatch the full report on this week's episode of Click", "HMS Glasgow was floated on the Clyde for the first time in December\n\nAn inquiry has been launched into \"intentional damage\" of a Royal Navy warship at a Scottish shipyard.\n\nDefence contractor BAE Systems said repairs were being assessed after about 60 cables were cut on HMS Glasgow.\n\nThe Type 26 frigate is currently being fitted out at BAE's yard at Scotstoun on the River Clyde in Glasgow.\n\nIt is the first of eight Type 26 vessels being built.

No-one saw Samuel fall in.\n\nAfter they fell in, witnesses said they had seen the boys in the water shouting for help, but they could not get out and a short time later the boys went under the surface.\n\nVigils were held and flowers laid after the deaths of the boys\n\nDet Insp Edmonds said his officers had been at the lake 11 minutes after the first 999 call had been received at about 14:35 GMT.\n\nThey ignored safety advice, took off their body armour and waded in to try to reach the area where they believed the boys had fallen in.\n\nThey used their fists and batons to break through the ice, but Det Insp Edmonds said the water had been too deep to get to them.\n\nAt the start of the inquest, Ms Hunt read out short descriptions of the boys, written by their families.\n\nJack was described as \"a loving caring boy\" who enjoyed being outside and loved animals.\n\nTom's family said he \"always had a smile on his face\" and loved going out on his bike and meeting new friends at the park.\n\nFinlay was said to have \"adored the outdoors, regardless of the weather\" and enjoyed the park.\n\nHis family also said he loved Pokemon cards and would often give them away to friends who did not have them.\n\nSamuel was described as \"the most independent six-year-old you've ever met\" who had a passion for Ironman, dogs and fire engines.\n\nMemorial plaques have been left near the lake\n\nDet Insp Edmonds said the air temperature at the lake at the time had been 5C (41F) and the water temperature had been even lower, which had affected the ability of the officers to function.\n\nThere had been a big risk to the rescuers themselves, Jason Wiles, from West Midlands Ambulance Service, said.\n\nParamedics had shouted to the rescuers to get out and one of the police officers had been in the water up to his neck, he added.\n\nMr Wiles said the officer had probably only just got out of the water in time.\n\nA tribute to the boys is in place at the park\n\nThe last child, Finlay, was recovered from the water by firefighters at 15:05 GMT, half an hour after the first 999 call.\n\nMs Hunt said: \"Sadly the boys were under the water for between 22 and 32 minutes.\"\n\nDet Insp Edmonds said he did not know why the ice had broken but it was a \"terrible tragedy\".\n\nHe did not believe his team could have done anything differently, he told the inquest.\n\nThe boys all received the best treatment possible on their way to hospital but brain damage would have occurred minutes after they were submerged, Mr Wiles said.\n\nThere were tears from the families of the boys as Dr Sarah Denniston, from Birmingham Heartlands Hospital, told the inquest efforts had been made to resuscitate the boys without success and drowning was the cause of death.\n\nThe air temperature on the day at the lake was 5C (41F) and the water temperature was even lower, the inquest heard\n\nThe temperature of the water in the lake would have caused the boys' bodies to go into shock, Alex Shapland, from West Midlands Fire Service, said.\n\nHe also said nothing more could have been done on the day by firefighters.\n\nHowever, the fire service would review its prevention work and planned regular safety campaigns in summer and winter to focus on the dangers of the water, he added.\n\nWest Midlands Ambulance Service said the deaths have deeply affected many of its staff\n\nAfter the inquest, area commander Alex Shapland said: \"Within days of the boys' deaths, we and colleagues across the country were dismayed to see people still risking their lives on frozen water.\"\n\nMr Shapland said an incident like the one at Babbs Mill lake could not be allowed to happen again.\n\nJames Williams, from West Midlands Ambulance Service, said it had been an \"incredible effort\" by the emergency services to try to save the boys and a \"tragedy\" they had been unsuccessful.\n\nHe said it had \"affected many of them deeply, knowing that those incredible efforts were just not quite enough\".\n\nSupt Rich Harris, from West Midlands Police, said after the inquest he was \"incredibly proud of those officers who showed such bravery and put their own safety to one side to try and save the lives of Jack, Tom, Fin and Sam.\"\n\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

The first arrived on Friday, an hour-and-a-half before the ferry was supposed to set sail - and was still waiting 15 hours later.\n\nMatt Barnes, director at Barnes Coaches, said no-one wants a repeat of the scenes over Easter\n\n\"By the time they actually got to a ferry, the port couldn't accept the coaches, they were sent away to a service station,\" he said.\n\n\"The service station hadn't been warned they were coming. There's hundreds and hundreds of people there. All the food outlets are closed, the toilets are overflowing, there's no provision for anybody. So the children were pretty much on the coaches for the 15 hours waiting to get on the ferry.\"\n\nHe added: \"The scenes that start these holidays are dreadful. No-one wants to repeat that and people are scared of travelling by ferry into Europe.\"\n\nHowever, Mr Barnes said he has had reassurances from the Port of Dover that it will be able to cope with the number of coaches.\n\n\"It is extremely important for us to pass on to our customers that they can trust this way of travelling into Europe,\" he said.\n\nA key issue for the Port of Dover is the time it takes for travellers to pass through border checks following the UK's departure from the European Union.\n\nIt now takes up to a minute-and-a-half to get a car through the port's border checks, which are staffed by France's Police aux Fronti\u00e8res. For coaches, it can take up to 15 minutes compared to a \"few minutes\" in pre-Brexit times.\n\nMr Bannister said: \"Right now, what has to happen is coach passengers need to disembark the coach, present themselves in front of Police aux Fronti\u00e8res to have their passports reviewed, any security questions that need to be asked are asked and [the passport] is stamped and [they] get back on the coach.\"\n\n\"There's no doubt that the additional checks are a factor in the queues,\" he said.\n\nBut he said that the port has taken a number of measures to speed things up since Easter.\n\nIt has reviewed all the traffic volumes to understand exactly what to expect.\n\nHe also said that the ferry operators have worked closely with coach companies to smooth the flow of traffic. This should ensure that coaches don't arrive at the port all at once.\n\n\"We created a new processing centre in the western part of the port to better sequence the traffic coming into the port and to the advanced passenger information checks,\" he said.\n\nIt also has a covered area where coaches will go for passenger passport checks.\n\n\"And then finally, what we've done is we've worked with all of our port partners, but specifically Police aux Fronti\u00e8res, to ensure that the resource levels are what we require, to make certain that we can maintain the flow rates.

Watch: Duwayne Brooks \"certain\" he could have identified sixth murder suspect\n\nStephen Lawrence's friend has said he could have identified a sixth suspect in his friend's murder if he had been given the opportunity.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC, Duwayne Brooks said he would have picked out Matthew White, who died in 2021, in a line-up.\n\nOn Monday, White was named as the sixth suspect in the racist killing 30 years ago, following a BBC investigation.\n\nStephen, 18, was killed in Eltham, south-east London in April 1993.\n\nMr Brooks was waiting for a bus with Stephen at the time.\n\nThe failure of the first police investigation prompted a landmark public inquiry which concluded the Met was institutionally racist.\n\nAsked whether pictures of White broadcast by the BBC investigation were of the same person he had described to police, Mr Brooks said: \"100%. Not only did I describe him as best I could, you had other witnesses at the bus stop who also described him.\"\n\n\"I am 100% certain that if that person was put before me, and the other witnesses, in the initial stages of the investigations on an ID parade, we all would have picked him out.\"\n\nIn 1993, Mr Brooks and eyewitness described an attacker who bore a plain resemblance to Matthew White, but police did not treat White as a suspect for years.\n\nThe BBC investigation included statements and artists' impressions from the time.\n\nMr Brooks said it would now be \"impossible\" to remember what the attacker looked like from memory, but \"there is no doubt in my mind, from what I described, from those drawings, what you can see from the other witnesses, that that is the person who was there. At the scene, on the night.\"\n\nAn artist's impression of the \"fair-haired attacker\", Matthew White and a police e-fit\n\nHe said the way his evidence was dealt with in 1993 involved \"corruption\" and \"decisions made back then were a deliberate act of sabotage\".\n\nWhen approached for comment the Met said it would not be issuing a new statement.\n\nMr Brooks originally spoke to the Sunday Mirror, before being interviewed by the BBC.\n\nThe Met Police has consistently said there were six white men involved, as Mr Brooks said on the night.\n\nFive prime suspects became widely known after the murder, but the public inquiry said there were \"five or six\" attackers.\n\nDavid Norris and Gary Dobson were given life sentences for the murder in 2012. The other three - Luke Knight and brothers Neil and Jamie Acourt - have not been convicted of the crime.\n\nWhite was arrested twice, in 2000 and 2013, and files were sent to the Crown Prosecution Service in 2005 and 2014. But on both occasions prosecutors said there was no realistic prospect of conviction.\n\nIn May and June 1993 Mr Brooks and eyewitnesses to the murder attended identity parades which included the prime suspects in the case, but Matthew White was not part of the parades.\n\nIn the same BBC interview, Mr Brooks said the criminal justice system doesn't work for victims \"at this moment in time\". He added that an apology from the Met would be a \"tick-boxing exercise\".\n\n\"The way I have been treated is a disgrace. My experience should never have happened.\"\n\nBaroness Doreen Lawrence, Stephen Lawrence's mother, has also criticised the police handling of information about a sixth suspect in her son's murder, saying there should be \"serious sanctions\" against the police officers who failed to investigate White.\n\nIn response to the naming of Matthew White as a suspect, the Met Police confirmed he was seen again in 2020, but there was insufficient witness or forensic evidence to progress further.\n\nDeputy Assistant Commissioner Matt Ward said: \"Unfortunately, too many mistakes were made in the initial investigation and the impact of them continues to be seen.\n\n\"On the 30th anniversary of Stephen's murder, Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley apologised for our failings and I repeat that apology today.\"", "A man has been found stabbed to death near Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\n\nHe was found unresponsive at 05:51 BST in Northumberland Park in Haringey, north London, said the Met Police, which has launched a murder inquiry.\n\nThe man suffered a number of stab injuries and, despite receiving CPR, was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nSunday evening's match between Tottenham Hotspur and Nottingham Forest will still take place, Spurs said in a statement.\n\n\"Following an incident in which an individual has lost their life, we are doing everything to accommodate the ongoing police investigation, which is of the utmost importance,\" the club said.\n\n\"We shall update supporters as and when we can, and ask for fans to be patient and allow extra travel time.\"\n\nThere have not been any arrests.

of Brexit in a parliamentary debate triggered by a petition.\n\nA three-hour debate was held after 183,000 people signed a petition calling for a public inquiry into the impact of leaving the European Union.\n\nThe government says Brexit was a \"democratic choice\" and dismissed calls for a public inquiry.\n\nBut some MPs branded Brexit a \"disaster\" and an \"error\".\n\nThe UK officially left the EU in January 2020 after a referendum in 2016 saw Leave beat Remain by a margin of 51.9% to 48.1%.\n\nThe decision meant making big, structural changes to the relationship between the UK and the EU, with areas such trade, investment and immigration affected.\n\nMost economists believe Brexit has had a negative effect on the UK economy, but some argue the benefits of leaving the EU will be seen over time.\n\nMonday's debate in Westminster Hall gave MPs an opportunity to discuss these issues, with most speakers criticising Brexit and those who backed it.\n\nThe discussion was led by Martyn Day, an SNP MP whose party wants an independent Scotland to rejoin the EU.\n\nHe said \"concerns have been expressed that no impact assessment has been carried out to assess the damage that Brexit has created\".\n\nHe cited comments made by Richard Hughes, the chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility, who recently told the BBC Brexit had been similar to the Covid pandemic in its impact.\n\nThe latest forecast by the OBR assumes Brexit will lead to a 4% reduction in the potential productivity of the UK economy, with the reduction building \"over time with the full effect felt after 15 years\".\n\n\"The economic fallout from Brexit is stark,\" Mr Day said.\n\n\"From my perspective, Brexit has been an unmitigated disaster\u2014politically, economically and socially, for Scotland and the rest of the UK.\n\nMr Day said he backed the petition, which said \"the truth about Brexit\" can only be established \"by an independent public inquiry, free from ideology and the opinions of vested interests\".\n\nPublic inquiries are usually initiated by a government minister, who appoints an independent chair or panel to examine matters of public concern, and produce one or more reports.\n\nOne recent example is the public inquiry into the UK government's handling of the Covid pandemic, which is under way.\n\nSNP MP Martyn Day opened the debate on the impact of Brexit\n\nLiberal Democrat MP Wera Hobhouse said a public inquiry \"would help us face up to reality and it would give a true picture of the impact on people, business and the whole economy\".\n\nLike Mr Day, she cited analysis by the OBR which, in its latest forecast, assumes that \"UK imports and exports will both be 15% lower in the long run than had we remained in the EU\".\n\nThe Liberal Democrats have said they would seek a closer economic relationship with EU if they were in government.\n\nThat position is anathema to Brexit-backing Conservative MPs like Adam Holloway, who spoke in favour of leaving the EU during the debate.\n\nMr Holloway said: \"In reality, we are arguing today about whether we should have voted to leave the EU or whether we should rejoin.\"\n\nThe Tory MP said the biggest benefit of Brexit was that \"our sovereignty has been repatriated\".\n\nHe said EU membership had brought \"social problems\" and \"enormous stress on public services\", which some MPs in the room did not understand.\n\n\"It is easy to undervalue sovereignty if the areas in which it was surrendered to the EU do not actually impact one's life,\" Mr Holloway said.\n\n\"It is easy to disdain patriotism if someone is economically and socially mobile and derives their self-worth from a well-paid job, or if their life is made easier by cheap labour as a result of free movement.\"\n\nLeo Docherty, Conservative MP for Aldershot, was the minister put forward to represent the government in the debate.\n\nHe said the government did \"not believe that it would be appropriate to hold an inquiry into the impact of Brexit\".\n\nHe said: \"Britain left the EU to do things differently and make our own laws, but this was not just political theory: our laws and tax framework and the way we spend our money all make a real difference to people's lives.\"", "Healthcare workers care for injured patrons outside the Madrid restaurant\n\nAt least two people have died and another ten were injured after a waiter flamb\u00e9ed a dish, accidentally setting fire to an Italian restaurant on a busy Friday evening in Madrid.\n\nOne of the injured is in a critical condition and five others have serious injuries.\n\nPlastic plants in the restaurant caught fire during the flamb\u00e9 process, and the flames rapidly spread.\n\nThe food is usually covered in spirits and set alight for dramatic effect, sometimes giving it a smoky flavour.\n\nThe fire broke out near the entrance of the Burro Canaglia restaurant, which made it harder for people to escape, Spanish newspaper El Pais reported.\n\nThe paper also reported that one of those who died was an employee.\n\nThough the blaze was extinguished quickly, it was \"extremely intense\" and generated \"a lot of smoke,\" the Mayor of Madrid, Jose Luis Martinez-Almeida said.\n\nThe mayor said there had been about 30 diners and staff members in the restaurant at the time of the fire.\n\nHe warned there would have been more victims had the firefighters taken longer to attend the scene, adding that it was extinguished within 10 minutes from the first warning of the blaze.\n\nPolice have launched an

House show she was \"overwhelmed\" by the support people had shown her.\n\nShe said it was \"the most extraordinary moment\" since her diagnosis.\n\nSpeaking to Paddy O'Connell on the programme, the Scottish journalist from Dundee spoke about her initial reaction to symptoms of Alzheimer's and the loneliness she now feared in her new home.\n\nThe signs that something was wrong were gradual at the start, Rae said.\n\n\"And then it started getting a bit more drastic, especially when I was actually at work.\"\n\nShe said that with some of the broadcasting work, she could record it again \"but of course, the live stuff finds you out\".\n\nIn a message for the fundraiser, Rae's son Rory Cargill said that, after 30 years on air, his mum had been left unable to work because of the condition.\n\nAlzheimer's disease affects the brain, and it is the most common cause of dementia. One of the most common symptoms is memory loss, and it can affect people of different ages - but over-65s are more susceptible to the disease.\n\nRae, who is 66, said she still felt physically very strong, which is often a good thing. But in other ways, she adds, \"you wish your brain was a great deal stronger than your physical body\".\n\nSusan Rae in a picture taken in 1984\n\nAfter initially living independently in a retirement community apartment, her needs have grown in recent months.\n\nBut she told the programme that her biggest challenge was dealing with loneliness in her new home.\n\n\"I've lost a lot of my friends,\" she said.\n\n\"I haven't physically lost them but I've missed being at the BBC with all my friends. That's the biggest thing.\"\n\nAmong those who have given donations to the fundraiser are several Radio 4 and Radio 3 listeners who remember her decades on air, working as a journalist, newsreader, continuity announcer and even reading the shipping forecast. One paid tribute to her \"melodious Scottish voice\".\n\nAsked about the public support towards her fundraiser, Rae said: \"I just want to say that this has been the most extraordinary moment about all of this.

It's more of a rocky mist.\n\n\"It's kind of like if you took sand grains, but much finer. We're talking silicate grains the size of smoke particles,\" explained Prof Beth Biller from the University of Edinburgh and the Royal Observatory Edinburgh, UK.\n\n\"That's what the clouds on VHS 1256b would be like, but a lot hotter. This planet is a hot, young object. The cloud-top temperature is maybe similar to the temperature of a candle flame,\" she told BBC News.\n\nVHS 1256b was first identified by the UK-developed Vista telescope in Chile in 2015.\n\nIt's what's termed a \"super Jupiter\" - a planet similar to the gas giant in our own Solar System, but a lot bigger, perhaps 12 to 18 times the mass.\n\nIt circles a couple of stars at great distance - about four times the distance that Pluto is from our Sun.\n\nEarlier observations of VHS 1256b showed it to be red-looking, hinting that it might have dust in its atmosphere. The Webb study confirms it.\n\n\"It's fascinating because it illustrates how different clouds on another planet can be from the water vapour clouds we are familiar with on the Earth,\" said Prof Biller.\n\n\"We see carbon monoxide (CO) and methane in the atmosphere, which is indicative of it being hot and turbulent, with material being drawn up from deep.\n\n\"There are probably multiple layers of silicate grains. The ones that we're seeing are some of the very, very fine grains that are higher up in the atmosphere, but there may be bigger grains deeper down in the atmosphere.\"\n\nTelescopes have previously detected silicates in so-called brown dwarfs. These are essentially star-like objects that have failed to ignite properly. But this is a first for a planet-sized object.\n\nTo make the detection, Webb used its Mid-Infrared Instrument (Miri), part-built in the UK, and its Near-Infrared Spectrometer (NirSpec).\n\nThey didn't take pretty pictures of the planet, at least not in this instance. What they did was tease apart the light coming from VHS 1256b into its component colours as a way to discern the composition of the atmosphere.\n\n\"JWST is the only telescope that can measure all these molecular and dust features together,\" said Miri co-principal investigator Prof Gillian Wright, who directs the STFC UK Astronomy Technology Centre, also in Edinburgh.\n\n\"The dynamic picture of the atmosphere of VHS 1256b provided by this study is a prime example of the discoveries enabled by using the advanced capabilities of Miri and NirSpec together.\"\n\nJWST's primary mission is to observe the pioneer stars and galaxies that first shone just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang. But a key objective is to investigate exoplanets. In Miri and NirSpec it has the tools to study their atmospheres in unprecedented detail.\n\nScientists hope they might even be able to tell whether some exoplanets have conditions suitable to host life.\n\nAstronomers are reporting Webb's observations of VHS 1256b in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n\nJames Webb is a collaborative project of the US, European and Canadian space agencies. It was launched in December 2021 and is regarded as the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope.", "Parents of children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) have told the BBC a lack of suitable childcare over school holidays has left them feeling \"rejected\".\n\nFigures shared with the BBC from the charity Coram, show that only one in 20 councils in England say there is enough childcare available for SEND children during the school holidays.\n\nIt also found that in some areas - including London, Yorkshire and the East Midlands - there were no councils with sufficient childcare available.\n\nCouncils say more funding and a larger workforce is needed.\n\nAmy Walker says she is unable to work because of having to look after her five-year-old son Charlie, who is autistic, during school holidays.\n\nSome disabled children need structure and routine to reduce anxiety and challenging behaviour, and Amy is worried about the effect spending the whole summer at home will have on Charlie.\n\n\"I'm absolutely dreading it. Six weeks of not having that routine is not good for any child, but a child with autism\u2026 it's going to have an impact on all of us as a family.\"\n\nAmy's older son Cory, 12, has previously attended holiday clubs but she finds it impossible to find affordable care for Charlie. She would like councils to organise clubs for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND).\n\n\"You don't want to see one of your children accepted and the other one rejected. I don't think Charlie should be discriminated against just because he has a disability - it's not fair,\" she said.\n\nIn findings shared with the BBC, Coram asked English local authorities whether there was sufficient childcare in all areas. Of the 126 (80%) who responded, only six councils (5%) said yes.\n\nCouncils in 23 areas (18%) said there was not enough childcare available, while 36 (29%) said it was only sufficient in some areas, and 61 (48%) said they were not able to tell whether it was.\n\nThe provision of holiday provision for children with additional needs was similar in Scotland, where no councils reported having enough childcare available in all areas, and in Wales, where only 5% of councils said there was adequate provision. Coram did not collect data for Northern Ireland.\n\nIn a different survey of 1,800 parents of children with SEND by the charity Contact and the Disabled Children's Partnership, nine in 10 said they were not able to find a suitable holiday club or activity.\n\nLocal authorities in England have a legal duty to make sure there is sufficient childcare available for children aged up to 14 whose parents work or want to work. For parents of disabled children, this extends to age 18.\n\nWhile there is a legal duty to provide provision, it does not have to be paid for by the local authority, so it can be unaffordable for many.\n\nUna Summerson, head of campaigns at Contact, said it wasn't uncommon for a family to be quoted more than \u00a3150 a day for a holiday club for their disabled child.\n\nThe government's holiday activities and food programme is available for low income families and provides funded childcare as well as a meal. Amy said Cory had previously attended them, but there was nothing on offer through this for Charlie due to his additional needs.\n\nNot only can the costs be prohibitive, Ms Summerson said her charity had \"also heard from families that said when they had been able to find the right childcare it was often oversubscribed, there were huge waiting lists so it's having an absolutely devastating impact on families\".\n\nCoram's research found that in large parts of England - including London, the South West, Yorkshire and the East Midlands - there were no councils with sufficient childcare available for disabled children in all areas. The areas with the best provision were the North West and North East, with 14% and 11% respectively.\n\nLouise Gittins from the Local Government Association said \"councils worked closely with childcare providers to improve access to holiday childcare... but without concerted investment and recruitment of quality staff this will be difficult to deliver.\"\n\nShe added: \"Adequate funding, skilled practitioners and wider system support are essential to the early identification of need and support for children with special educational needs and disabilities, as set out in the government's own SEND and alternative provision improvement plan earlier this year.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Education said the government is \"investing \u00a330m to test new and innovative approaches to short respite breaks for families of children and young people with special educational needs or disabilities\".\n\n\"Our holiday activities and food programme, backed by \u00a3200m per year to 2025, provides heathy meals, enriching activities and free childcare places to children from low-income families over the holidays.\"", "One child was killed and two were seriously injured in the shooting at the school in Vantaa\n\nIn the aftermath of the shooting that saw a 12-year-old kill another child and injure two in the city of Vantaa, north of the capital Helsinki, the headlines in Finland have been full of soul-searching.\n\n\"What kind of events led to such an extreme act?\"\n\n\"How could a 12-year-old get hold of a gun?\"\n\n\"Could the incident have been prevented somehow?\"\n\nFew of these questions have had answers so far.\n\nInstead, harrowing details about the events in Vantaa have continued to emerge.\n\nThe boy wore a mask and noise-cancelling headphones, showing his actions were premeditated. He shot his victims on a school premises they all knew well and spent time in every day. The two girls he wounded are still in a serious condition in hospital.\n\nMost shocking of all, the killer was 12 years old.\n\nThere have been other school shootings in Finland, although not many: this was only the fourth in the country's history.\n\n\"In this case the shooter and the victims are really too young,\" Tomi Kiilakoski, youth researcher at the University of Tampere, told the BBC. \"We are really talking about children - and that shocks us.\"\n\nSquaring up the brutality of the crime with the young age of the suspect was difficult, he said, and the incident came as \"a big shock for children, for the community, for young people and for the whole of Finnish society\".\n\nPolice revealed on Wednesday that the suspect had indicated the motive behind the shooting was that he had been bullied, and their initial inquiry had confirmed that.\n\nThis is likely to worry many Finnish parents. Bullying is very difficult to eradicate, and relatively widespread: studies show that 8.6% of children between the ages of 10-11 in Finland are bullied every week.\n\nOf course, victims of bullying rarely end up killing others, but bullying often features as one of the reasons for extreme acts of violence.\n\nAfter two school shootings in 2007 and 2008 left 18 dead, a police inspector said that a \"system of pre-emptive measures\" had been built in that allowed police to intervene if they received information on a \"person's intent to stage an attack\".\n\nOn Tuesday, Finland's National Police Commissioner Seppo Kolehmainen had to admit that system had failed.\n\nHenri Rikander, associate professor of police law at the University of Eastern Finland, told the BBC that out of the 60-100 potential mass shootings Finnish police investigate each year, about 20 are typically in the last stages of preparation and can be classified as \"serious\".\n\nIn the Vantaa case, the boy does not appear to have talked about his plans with anybody - and so may have fallen through the cracks.\n\nThat has left Finns wondering how to prevent such a tragedy from happening again.\n\nAs it stands, the Vantaa suspect will not face charges and has been placed in the care of social services - so some sections of Finnish society are calling for the age of criminal responsibility to be lowered from 15.\n\nLast summer, Interior Minister Mari Rantanen of Finland's far-right Finns Party said the age should be lowered in order to \"break the cycle of crime\" among those younger than 15.\n\nJani Makela, chairman of the Finns Party parliamentary group, told the BBC that \"there have been cases in which the 15-year age limit is suspected to have been exploited on purpose\".\n\nBut others disagree that such a move would have any preventative effect.\n\nProf Rikander said violent episodes should be prevented through social intervention rather than \"official control\".\n\nHarmful or worrying behaviour in others was easier to spot in contexts like sports clubs, schools or at home, he explained, but the \"increasing isolation\" of young people meant that worrying signs were being missed.\n\n\"The most important thing is preventative measures,\" said Tomi Kiilakoski. \"What I would hope to see is a societal discussion on how we can provide services for children and young people in supporting their growth.\"\n\nIt is not yet known how a 12-year-old was able to get hold of a firearm. But we do know it belonged to a close relative and weapons are not hard to come by in Finland. With its vast open spaces and woodland, it calls itself a country of \"hunters and gun enthusiasts\".\n\nAccording to the interior ministry, there are more than 1.5 million licensed firearms in Finland and about 430,000 people with licences, meaning almost 8% of Finland's 5.6 million residents have a gun licence. There is no limit to the number of guns that can be owned.\n\nSo far, there has been little discussion around tightening gun legislation. \"We are proud of ourselves for being close to nature and hunting is a part of that,\" said Tomi Kiilakoski, adding that fatal shootings in Finland were low despite the high number of guns.\n\nThe boy's relatives will now have to explain how the revolver-type handgun came into the child's possession. Finnish legislation states that firearms must be \"locked in such a way that the firearm... cannot be easily stolen\". This appears not to have been the case.\n\nThe Viertola school where the shooting occurred reopened on Wednesday, in part to give students a chance to ask questions about what had happened.\n\nThe vast majority of pupils did turn up. A Red Cross volunteer told the Italehti news website that it was clear pupils needed to talk: \"The most important question they asked was: why?\"\n\nAs a boy lies dead and two girls remain in hospital in a serious condition, Finns are searching for answers.", "Allies: Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and his Malian counterpart Abdoulaye Diop in Moscow last year\n\nThe Ministry of Defence has launched an investigation after emails containing classified information were sent to a close ally of Russia in a typing error.\n\nThe emails were intended for the US military, which uses the domain name \".mil\".\n\nBut they missed out the letter i, and so the messages went instead to the West African nation of Mali.\n\nThe MoD said fewer than 20 emails were sent to an \"incorrect domain\" and were \"not classified at secret or above\".\n\nIn a tweet, it said it was \"confident there was no breach of operational security or disclosure of technical data\", calling the emails \"routine\".\n\n\"We have opened an investigation after a small number of emails were mistakenly forwarded to an incorrect email domain,\" an MoD spokesman told PA news agency.\n\nThe spokesman added that all sensitive information used by the government department was \"shared on systems designed to minimise the risk of misdirection\".\n\n\"The MoD constantly reviews its processes and is currently undertaking a programme of work to improve information management, data loss prevention, and the control of sensitive information,\" they added.\n\nEarlier this month, it emerged that millions of US military emails had also been sent to Mali, because of the same typing error.\n\nSome of those emails were believed to have contained sensitive information including passwords, medical records and the itineraries of top officers.\n\nMali was one of the six African countries promised free grain shipments by Russian President Vladimir Putin after the collapse of the Black Sea deal with Ukraine earlier this month.\n\nRussia's navy blockaded Ukraine's Black Sea ports following its invasion in February 2022, trapping 20 million tonnes of grain which were meant for export and creating food shortages in Middle Eastern and African countries.\n\nMali is also a close Russian ally because Moscow's Wagner mercenaries have been deployed in the country to fight alongside the army against jihadists.\n\nEarlier this week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Mali's defence minister, air force chief and the deputy chief of staff would be sanctioned for co-ordinating the spread of Wagner in the West African country.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nRamadan is usually a month of quiet contemplation for millions of Muslims around the world.\n\nFasting from food and water during daylight hours, it is a period of deep introspection and inner peace.\n\nBut for some physical fitness still plays a major role, and they say their exercise and spiritual journeys run together on the same pathway.\n\nPilates instructor Sahir Ahmed-Evans believes there is a natural connection between fasting and fitness.\n\n\"Fasting is a discipline,\" she said.\n\n\"We go without food, water, we're challenging our bodies. We stay committed and consistent for the 30 days.\n\n\"It's exactly the same with exercise\u2026 you have to be committed, you certainly have to have discipline.\n\n\"And to get results you're going to have to be consistent. I think they just go hand in hand\".\n\nSahir's tips: Don't aim for personal bests, focus on maintaining, reduce workout intensity on a fasting day, keep cardio to just before opening fasting\n\nSahir, 46, the owner of SAE Pilates and Fitness Studio in Cardiff, pursued a lifestyle and career in health and fitness after a period of ill health, and said she hit a point when she had to make a change.\n\nNow, as a qualified pilates instructor, she coaches other women as a passionate advocate of women's health and wellness.\n\n\"In Ramadan, not only are we working towards our spiritual health, I feel that ties in with your emotional, mental and physical health.\n\n\"It's a complete overhaul to set you on a new programme for the rest of the year. As much as it's about spiritual improvement; improving our relationship with God, ourselves and others, it's improving us as whole.\n\n\"We can get complacent, and life takes over, but Ramadan resets it so that you realise that you are capable of a lot. If you're capable of fasting\u2026 then that means you have a deep inner strength, to take into your workouts and into life\".\n\nRamadan ends this week, and many Muslims are exempt from fasting, particularly when it's deemed healthier not to do so. This includes children, the elderly, people who are unwell or who may be travelling, or those menstruating or breastfeeding.\n\n\"My spiritual health is very closely related to my mental and physical health,\" says Dr Nabeel Illahi\n\nBut for those who have been fasting, Dr Nabeel Illahi, 29, said they could get a number of health benefits.\n\n\"As the eating window is shorter, this usually leads to consuming lower calories throughout the day overall, resulting in weight loss, so fasting can help with obesity,\" said Dr Illahi, who is a GP in training.\n\n\"Obesity is also an independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes and heart disease, so it would help in reducing your chances of getting any of these\".\n\n\"Evidence also shows fasting reduces inflammation in the body, and we know increased inflammation is linked with cancer, heart disease and more, so there are a number of health benefits linked with fasting\".\n\nThe links to health benefits have made fasting popular worldwide, even among those who are not Muslims.\n\nNabeel's tip: \"People want to know about fancy stuff but it's simple - you need to be drinking two to three litres of water at regular intervals, throughout the evening and night\"\n\nFor Dr Illahi, who also makes fitness content online, the spiritual aspect of the month is a boost for his fitness.\n\n\"My spiritual health is very closely related to my mental and physical health, because I've noticed when I feel close to God, then I feel better with my mental health.\n\n\"I'm able to deal with my challenges better. My mood is better and I actually feel like working out\".\n\nRoutines can be disrupted for some people during the month, due to the pre-dawn meal and night prayers.\n\nDr Illahi said he noticed people who may struggle through the day are suffering from a lack of sufficient sleep.\n\n\"You need to be trying to get at least seven to nine hours of healthy continuous sleep even in the month of Ramadan,\" he said.\n\n\"Religion to me is the most important thing at the end of the day,\" says Amin Ullah\n\nIn the run-up to competing in his first bodybuilding competition, Amin Ullah, 25, has been working out twice a day, before and after breaking his fast.\n\n\"If I wasn't competing I wouldn't be training as vigorously as I have been, with the same intensity,\" said Amin, from Barry, Vale of Glamorgan.\n\nHe described stopping fasting as like \"losing a sense of self, because if I don't train I don't feel right\".\n\nHe has been training for eight years on and off, but this year has been his first in maintaining a workout routine through Ramadan.\n\n\"Religion to me is the most important thing at the end of the day,\" he said.\n\n\"This year I've tried to make no excuses, I still want to perform my five daily prayers and fast every day, while working out and being as productive as I can.\n\n\"And this Ramadan I've been able to make the most of both religion, and just my day-to-day life, to the highest potential I can\".", "Roads and fields near Enniskillen turned white as snow fell on Thursday afternoon\n\nFlights have been disrupted and some roads closed as heavy snow falls in parts of Northern Ireland.\n\nA number of homes are without power due to severe weather conditions causing damage to the network, Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE) said.\n\nA severe weather warning has been issued for three counties.\n\nThe Met Office has said parts of counties Antrim, Down and Armagh could expect snow and ice between 15:00 GMT on Thursday and 04:00 on Friday.\n\nThe amber warning is the second highest level that can be issued by the Met Office and means there is a risk of travel delays and road closures.\n\nOther counties are under a lesser, yellow-level warning.\n\nSnow has been falling across many areas overnight and it is expected to become more heavy and persistent towards the east coast.\n\nThe Met Office is warning of \"atrocious\" travel conditions, especially over higher ground.\n\nBetween 4cm and 8cm of snow is expected away from coastal areas, with between 10cm and 20cm over higher ground.\n\nThis lamb in a field near Carryduff felt the chill of a snowy day for the first time\n\nThe yellow warning for the rest of Northern Ireland lasts from 07:00 GMT on Thursday until 14:00 on Friday.\n\nA number of roads have been closed due to treacherous conditions, including Church Road in Holywood, County Down.\n\nThe Strangford ferry has been suspended and some bus services disrupted.\n\nBelfast International and Belfast City Airports have tweeted that there may be flight disruption due to the weather conditions.\n\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) is advising drivers to take extra care, especially on roads that may not have been gritted.\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

Major indexes in Europe also ended higher, with UBS climbing roughly 1.5% by the end of the day.\n\nIn the US, the three major exchanges also gained, despite worries about another regional bank, First Republic.\n\nShares in the San Francisco-based firm sank more than 40%, as the injection of funds by 11 of America's biggest banks last week failed to restore confidence in the bank's future.\n\nThere were reports of another effort to stabilise the bank - which has seen shares plunge as customers transfer their money - as authorities sought to keep the crisis contained.\n\nShares of some other banks in the US and Europe also remained under pressure.\n\nIn the UK, a spokesperson for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak aimed to reassure investors saying UK banks were \"safe and well capitalised\" after the emergency rescue of Credit Suisse.\n\nIt came after central banks around the globe made similar comments.\n\nSix central banks, including the US Federal Reserve, also announced they would boost the flow of dollars in the global financial system to make sure banks had easy access to cash.\n\nDespite the panic, experts do not expect a repeat of 2008 when banks stopped lending to each other. The situation was so dire then it sparked a global recession.\n\nBanks have been struggling with the recent rise in interest rates which has left some sitting on substantial losses.\n\nIt led to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank - two medium sized lenders - in the US last week and sparked concerns other banks could get into trouble.\n\nCredit Suisse - which had been loss-making for some time but which was otherwise well capitalised - has been hit by this crisis of confidence.\n\nThe 167-year-old institution is one of around 30 banks worldwide deemed too big to fail because they are of such importance to the banking system.\n\nSwitzerland's second largest lender, which has struggled with a string of scandals over the last few years, was sold to UBS at just over $3.15bn (\u00a32.6bn), a fraction of its $8bn price tag on Friday.\n\nMark Yallop, the former UK chief executive of UBS, said the deal \"should\" do the job of reassuring investors.\n\n\"This is a takeover of a challenged institution with particular idiosyncratic problems that relate to it specifically [and are] not reflective of broader issues in the banking markets,\" he told the BBC's Today programme.\n\nThe chairmen of both banks spoke at a news conference in Bern on Sunday\n\nUBS chairman Colm Kelleher said it would wind down Credit Suisse's investment banking operations but that it was \"too early\" to say what would happen about jobs.\n\nCredit Suisse has around 74,000 staff, around 5,000 of them in the UK.\n\n\"We need to do this in a rational way thoughtfully, when we've sat down and analysed what we need to do,\" he said.\n\nOrdinary people have little reason to fear for their funds.\n\nIn the highly unlikely scenario that a bank or building society actually collapses, then deposit protection is in place.\n\nIn the UK, that means \u00a385,000 per person, per institution is protected (or \u00a3170,000 in a joint account).\n\nSo, if you have \u00a385,000 in one bank, and another \u00a385,000 in a separately licensed bank, then it is all safe if both went bust, under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.\n\nThere is also a higher temporary limit of \u00a31m for six months, if you get a sudden influx of funds, such as an inheritance.\n\nProtection is similar in the EU, and the US government has safeguarded deposits of up to $250,000 for a long time.", "Twitter has changed its brand and logo from its famous blue bird to \"X\".\n\nThe new white X on a black background has replaced the blue bird on the desktop version of the social network, although is yet to appear on the mobile app.\n\n\"Tweets\" will also be replaced, according to Twitter's owner Elon Musk, and posts will be called \"x's\".\n\nThe billionaire changed his profile picture to the new logo and added \"X.com\" to his Twitter bio.\n\nMr Musk wants to create a \"super app\" called X - his vision for a new kind of social media platform that he has been talking about creating for months.\n\nOn Sunday, the billionaire said he was looking to change Twitter's logo, tweeting: \"And soon we shall bid adieu to the Twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds.\"\n\nHe then shared a picture of the new X branding projected onto the side of Twitter headquarters in San Francisco.\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

But charities say military bases and boats are \"wholly inadequate places\" to house people fleeing war and persecution.\n\nThe three-storey Bibby Stockholm - which has 222 rooms and can house more than 500 people - has been refurbished since it was criticised as an \"oppressive environment\" when the Dutch government used it for asylum seekers.\n\nThe vessel now has en-suite rooms, a TV and games room and a gym, according to a fact sheet from its owners, Bibby Maritime.\n\nThe UK-based company refused to confirm the deal to the BBC, but said it provides \"practical, safe and comfortable\" accommodation for a \"wide range of clients across the globe\".\n\nEnvironment Secretary Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey said the government's priority is to convert disused military bases for use as migrant accommodation, but said it was \"actively considering what can be done with some of these floating vessels\".\n\n\"But the priority is making sure we get those bases deployed first,\" she said.\n\nDetails about any deal to use the Bibby Stockholm barge have not yet been confirmed, but a Home Office spokesperson said: \"The pressure on the asylum system has continued to grow and requires us to look at a range of accommodation options which offer better value for money for taxpayers than hotels.\"\n\nThe chief executive of Portland Port, Bill Reeves, said his site had \"been selected by the Home Office to provide space for an accommodation facility,\" adding that he was \"liaising with the Home Office about the next steps\".\n\nMr Drax, whose constituency includes Portland, told the BBC he was \"very concerned\" about the impact on businesses in the area.\n\n\"We don't have the reception centres that should have been built\" to house asylum seekers, he said.\n\nThe area is \"very sensitive\" and relies on small businesses, Mr Drax said, adding: \"If 800 or 900 people descend on us like this it's going to have in my view an adverse effect on business.\"\n\nDorset Council has also said it has \"serious concerns about the suitability of the location for this facility.\"\n\nSpeaking to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg on Sunday, Ms Braverman refused to confirm the deal, saying her office was \"looking at all sorts of lands, sites and vessels\".\n\nMore than 51,000 asylum seekers are currently being housed in nearly 400 hotels around the UK.\n\nAs part of efforts to tackle the issue, last week Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick announced plans to use ex-military bases to house migrants.\n\nHe told the Commons that \"the sheer number of small boats have overwhelmed the asylum system\", adding the government would \"not elevate the wellbeing of illegal migrants above the British people\".\n\n\"Accommodation for migrants should meet essential living needs and nothing more, because we cannot risk becoming a magnet for the millions of people who are displaced and seeking better economic prospects,\" he said.\n\nThe plans were criticised by Labour, with shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper saying the announcement was an \"admission of failure\".\n\n\"They've got this huge backlog of asylum decisions, so much so that 98% of last year's small boats arrivals simply haven't even been decided or processed,\" she said.", "The \u00a32 cap on bus fares in England has been extended again until the end of October, the government has announced.\n\nThe cap, which applies to more than 130 bus operators outside of London, will then rise in November to \u00a32.50 for 12 months, before prices are reviewed.\n\nThe current limit on fares has now been extended twice after warnings hundreds of services could be cut without it.\n\nIts aim is to ease the cost of living pressures on passengers but also to encourage people to use buses.\n\nBus operators have still not seen the same number of passengers return to using services as before the Covid pandemic, with levels recovering to around 85 to 90%, according to the Department for Transport.\n\nThe Confederation of Passenger Transport, which is the trade association for the UK's bus and coach sector, welcomed the extra funding for the scheme and said it would help operators and councils to \"promote and grow services with greater confidence\".\n\nBut Graham Vidler, chief executive of the body, warned the funding and cap extension would \"not save every service in every part of the country\".\n\nThe trade association has repeatedly claimed that up to 15% of services could be scrapped without further funding for the sector. It has said if the government is \"really serious\" about levelling up, then ministers need to \"back our buses for the long term\".\n\nTravel is one of the main costs to come out of household budgets, which have been squeezed in recent months by the rise in fuel, food and energy prices.\n\nPrices for all goods are rising and inflation, which is the rate at which prices go up, is at 10.1%, meaning items are more than 10% more expensive than they were a year ago on average.\n\nNorman Baker, of the Campaign for Better Transport, urged the government to advertise the bus fare cap to attract people who do not usually use buses in order to grow passenger numbers.\n\n\"The huge success of the scheme proves that by making public transport more affordable, more people will use it and revenue can be increased,\" he added.\n\nSome of the longest routes which the cap applies to include:\n\nSome people have gone viral on social media after travelling up and down the UK using \u00a32 bus tickets.\n\nExtending the current cap until the end of October and then subsiding fares at \u00a32.50 until November 2024 will cost \u00a3200m, the government said.\n\nAs well as releasing cash to keep the cap in place, the Department for Transport said it would provide \u00a3300m to councils and operators until 2025 to protect routes that passengers rely on for work, education and medical appointments, and to improve infrastructure.\n\nAre you a user of buses and will benefit from this cap being extended?\n\nThe government said continuing to cap fares would particularly benefit people on lower incomes who it said take three times as many bus trips than those on higher incomes.\n\nTransport Secretary Mark Harper said the reason for extending the scheme was due to bus travel being \"the most popular form of public transport\", with millions of people relying on them.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak added: \"By extending the \u00a32 fare cap, we're making sure bus travel remains accessible and affordable for everyone, while helping to ease cost of living pressures.\"\n\nThe government said to help support the bus industry, it has provided more than \u00a32bn in funding to recover from the pandemic.\n\nIn 2021, ministers published a National Bus Strategy, involving hundreds of miles of new bus lanes and price caps on tickets which would make buses cheaper and easier to use.\n\nBut the Transport committee of MPs, whose job is to scrutinise the Department for Transport, said in a report released in March that while many of the strategy's ideas \"were on the right track\", progress in implementing them had \"sometimes been too slow, and in some cases, too piecemeal\".\n\nIt said without further rounds of funding for councils and bus companies, the plans would \"barely scratch the surface\".", "Lord Kerslake, a former head of the Civil Service, has died at the age of 68.\n\nLord Kerslake, who had been diagnosed with cancer, died on Saturday, his sister and daughter announced on Twitter.\n\nHe led the Civil Service between January 2012 and September 2014, during David Cameron's coalition government.\n\nHe had recently been working with the Labour Party on its preparations for the next general election.\n\nBath-born Lord Kerslake started his career in local government with the Greater London Council, and was knighted in the 2005 New Year honours list for services to local government.\n\nAs Bob Kerslake, he served as chief executive of Sheffield City Council between 1997 and 2008, before heading to the Homes and Communities Agency.\n\nHe was permanent secretary at the Department for Communities and Local Government from 2010 to 2015 -

We are monitoring the service, and we continue to work hard to determine the root cause and the impact this has had.\"\n\nThe issues began on Sunday morning and continued well into the evening, even after BT switched to a \"back-up system\", Parliament heard.\n\nPressed over when the government was made aware of the problem, technology minister Lord Camrose said: \"The event that caused caused the platform to go down occurred at 06:30 on Sunday. The government was advised of the event at 09:20, so just under three hours later.\n\n\"I understand that they informed the government as quickly as it was practically possible for them to do so. One of the areas they will look into as part of the inquiry is whether that should have been, could have been, faster.\"\n\nHe said the issue has now been fully resolved, and the service is running as normal.\n\nHe added: \"A full investigation is under way to understand what caused this problem.\"\n\nLabour peer Baroness Anderson of Stoke-on-Trent, who previously sat in the Commons as Ruth Smeeth, called it \"an incredibly disconcerting event\".\n\n\"Any failure in the system will undermine faith in our emergency provision.

China's President Xi Jinping has said \"reunification\" with Taiwan \"must be fulfilled\".\n\nAlthough China often holds drills around Taiwan, the \"encirclement\" is being seen as a response to Taiwan's President Tsai meeting US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy on Wednesday.\n\nPresident Tsai said on Saturday that her government would continue working with the US and other democracies as the island faces \"continued authoritarian expansionism\" from China.\n\nShe made the comments in a meeting with a US congressional delegation in Taipei led by House foreign affairs committee chairman Michael McCaul.\n\nMr McCaul said Washington was working to supply weapons to Taiwan, \"not for war, but for peace\".\n\nBut in Taiwan's capital Taipei, residents seemed unperturbed by China's latest manoeuvres.\n\n\"I think many Taiwanese have gotten used to it by now, the feeling is like, here we go again!\" Jim Tsai said.\n\nMeanwhile, Michael Chuang said: \"They [China] seems to like doing it, circling Taiwan like it's theirs.

So when they are stranded they can crush themselves to death.\n\n\"Pilot whales don't usually come in to shore.

Ukraine lost six soldiers in the process.\n\nIts name means \"not boring\" in Ukrainian.\n\nAn obvious irony for a village that was occupied by Russia in spring last year - a few weeks after President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIt was at the most northern point of a protruding Russian front line.\n\nAs our army escort, Anatoliy, speeds along scarred roads in his camouflaged truck towards Neskuchne, it's clear this is a different kind of liberation to what we saw last year.\n\nFirstly there are no civilians here. The only remnants of civilisation come in the form of a blown out pharmacy and food store.\n\nThere isn't a complex network of trenches either. A makeshift wooden bridge over a river is all it takes to take us into territory Russia has held for so long.\n\nBuildings are also riddled with bullet holes from smaller calibre weapons. There's been a lot of close quarter fighting here.\n\nAnatoliy doesn't like to hang around for long.\n\nMortars are periodically fired from Ukrainian troops hidden in thick tree lines or abandoned gardens. He explains the Russians are just on the brow of hill in three directions.\n\nThe sudden rising of three plumes of smoke is a cue to keep moving. The Russians are responding with Grad missiles.\n\nThe situation here is far more fluid than the triumphant claims of liberation which had come from from Kyiv this week.\n\nRussian forces have been pushing back as recently as last night, which Ukrainian officials have now acknowledged.\n\nUkraine's counteroffensive is in its early stages with modest gains.\n\nIf Neskuchne is anything to go by, any liberation will be far from immediate, and won't necessarily bring freedom straight away.\n\nFormer residents of Neskuchne told the BBC that the village was also briefly occupied in 2014 - when Russia-backed fighters seized large swathes of land in the Donetsk and neighbouring Luhansk regions. This followed the illegal annexation by Russia of Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula.\n\nThe small village then went back into Ukrainian hands only to be seized by Russian troops soon after last year's invasion.\n\nEarlier this week, a video emerged purportedly showing two Ukrainian soldiers raising the country's blue-and-yellow national flag on destroyed buildings in Neskuchne.\n\nThe loud booming sound of nearby shelling can also be heard.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Watch: Duwayne Brooks \"certain\" he could have identified sixth murder suspect\n\nStephen Lawrence's friend has said he could have identified a sixth suspect in his friend's murder if he had been given the opportunity.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC, Duwayne Brooks said he would have picked out Matthew White, who died in 2021, in a line-up.\n\nOn Monday, White was named as the sixth suspect in the racist killing 30 years ago, following a BBC investigation.\n\nStephen, 18, was killed in Eltham, south-east London in April 1993.\n\nMr Brooks was waiting for a bus with Stephen at the time.\n\nThe failure of the first police investigation prompted a landmark public inquiry which concluded the Met was institutionally racist.\n\nAsked whether pictures of White broadcast by the BBC investigation were of the same person he had described to police, Mr Brooks said: \"100%. Not only did I describe him as best I could, you had other witnesses at the bus stop who also described him.\"\n\n\"I am 100% certain that if that person was put before me, and the other witnesses, in the initial stages of the investigations on an ID parade, we all would have picked him out.\"\n\nIn 1993, Mr Brooks and eyewitness described an attacker who bore a plain resemblance to Matthew White, but police did not treat White as a suspect for years.\n\nThe BBC investigation included statements and artists' impressions from the time.\n\nMr Brooks said it would now be \"impossible\" to remember what the attacker looked like from memory, but \"there is no doubt in my mind, from what I described, from those drawings, what you can see from the other witnesses, that that is the person who was there. At the scene, on the night.\"\n\nAn artist's impression of the \"fair-haired attacker\", Matthew White and a police e-fit\n\nHe said the way his evidence was dealt with in 1993 involved \"corruption\" and \"decisions made back then were a deliberate act of sabotage\".\n\nWhen approached for comment the Met said it would not be issuing a new statement.\n\nMr Brooks originally spoke to the Sunday Mirror, before being interviewed by the BBC.\n\nThe Met Police has consistently said there were six white men involved, as Mr Brooks said on the night.\n\nFive prime suspects became widely known after the murder, but the public inquiry said there were \"five or six\" attackers.\n\nDavid Norris and Gary Dobson were given life sentences for the murder in 2012. The other three - Luke Knight and brothers Neil and Jamie Acourt - have not been convicted of the crime.\n\nWhite was arrested twice, in 2000 and 2013, and files were sent to the Crown Prosecution Service in 2005 and 2014. But on both occasions prosecutors said there was no realistic prospect of conviction.\n\nIn May and June 1993 Mr Brooks and eyewitnesses to the murder attended identity parades which included the prime suspects in the case, but Matthew White was not part of the parades.\n\nIn the same BBC interview, Mr Brooks said the criminal justice system doesn't work for victims \"at this moment in time\". He added that an apology from the Met would be a \"tick-boxing exercise\".\n\n\"The way I have been treated is a disgrace. My experience should never have happened.\"\n\nBaroness Doreen Lawrence, Stephen Lawrence's mother, has also criticised the police handling of information about a sixth suspect in her son's murder, saying there should be \"serious sanctions\" against the police officers who failed to investigate White.\n\nIn response to the naming of Matthew White as a suspect, the Met Police confirmed he was seen again in 2020, but there was insufficient witness or forensic evidence to progress further.\n\nDeputy Assistant Commissioner Matt Ward said: \"Unfortunately, too many mistakes were made in the initial investigation and the impact of them continues to be seen.\n\n\"On the 30th anniversary of Stephen's murder, Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley apologised for our failings and I repeat that apology today.\"", "Shadow climate secretary Ed Miliband has hinted that Labour could require newly-built homes to have solar panels on their roofs if it wins power.\n\nSpeaking after a speech on green investment, he said his party was \"very interested\" in the idea, adding: \"Watch this space, we'll say more about this.\"\n\nThe government has cut taxes on domestic solar panels and says it is looking at other ways to reduce costs.\n\nReductions in the cost of installation in recent years has made them a more attractive option for homeowners trying to reduce rising energy bills.\n\nNew carbon-reducing requirements for new builds in England, however, do not make any particular technology compulsory. A consultation on future rules is due to begin this spring.\n\nMr Miliband made his comments after a speech setting out Labour's plans to introduce a \"British version\" of US President Biden's multi-billion dollar blueprint to subsidise new green industries.\n\nThe plan, signed into law last year, has sparked warnings from British ministers about a slide into protectionism.\n\nHowever, Mr Miliband said these worries were \"overblown,\" and the UK needed to invest more to avoid falling behind in a \"global race\" to attract jobs in sectors such as electric car manufacturing.\n\nAsked whether his party would to pass new legislation requiring solar panels on new builds, he replied: \"On the solar rooftop revolution, that's something we're very interested in.\"\n\nHe did not give details of what the party might be considering, but said: \"Watch this space, we'll say more about this.\n\n\"I think it's a huge opportunity on commercial premises, and huge opportunity in the home as well,\" he added.\n\nThe government says it has promoted solar technology through a VAT cut on installation costs, streamlined planning rules for domestic properties, and grant schemes.\n\nMinisters have also said they are working with lenders to develop low-cost finance options for homes and small businesses willing to borrow to invest in the technology.\n\nBut speaking to MPs earlier this month, Climate Secretary Grant Shapps argued making them mandatory could harm innovation in other technologies, and push up the cost of new housing.\n\nHe also argued that introducing new rules now could lead to an \"additional housing crisis\" due to global demand for the minerals required to make them.\n\nBrian Berry, chief executive of the Federation of Master Builders, said Mr Miliband's comments were \"laudable,\" but added any new requirement would have to bear in mind the impact on the \"cost and viability\" of new homes.\n\nHe added that at a time of rising living costs, the \"bigger challenge\" was to make homes more energy efficient.\n\nAnother industry body, the Home Builders Federation, said solar panels were already being widely used and would soon be included on the vast majority of all new houses.", "The seaweed, pebbles and sand make Pwllheli look like an aquatic mammal\n\nThis photo of Pwllheli harbour looks so much like a dolphin you might think it was built on porpoise.\n\nThe aerial snap was taken in Gwynedd by Rhys Jones at the start of the month.

Sa-Nur, Ganim, Kadim and Homesh.\n\nThen-Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's government said the latter move would help \"provide Palestinian territorial contiguity\" in the West Bank and make it easier for Palestinians to live a normal life.\n\nIsraelis were banned from entering the evacuated area without the permission from the Israeli military.\n\nHowever, a group of settlers were able to establish a Jewish religious school and an unauthorised outpost at Homesh which the new coalition government - the most right-wing and nationalist in Israel's history - has been pushing to legalise.\n\nOn Monday night, lawmakers voted to repeal parts of the 2005 law so that Israelis could return to the sites of the evacuated settlements.\n\n\"The State of Israel tonight began its recovery process from the deportation disaster,\" tweeted Yuli Edelstein, a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party who sponsored the bill.\n\n\"This is the first and significant step towards real healing and settlement in Israel's homeland territories, which belong to it.\"\n\nBut the Israeli anti-settlement watchdog Peace Now said the return of settlers to the area would be \"a huge security burden and a focus of settler violence\".\n\n\"This decision will also pave the way for establishing many more outposts in an area that is now almost entirely Palestinian,\" it added.\n\nPalestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas's spokesman denounced the decision, saying the Israeli government was defying international law and working to sabotage international efforts to de-escalate the situation.\n\nThe US said it was deeply troubled by the vote in Israel's parliament.\n\n\"Coming at a time of heightened tensions, the legislative changes announced today are particularly provocative and counterproductive to efforts to restore some measures of calm as we head into Ramadan, Passover and the Easter holidays,\" state department spokesman Vedant Patel said.\n\nA spokesperson for the European Union said the Israeli move \"hampers the possibility to pursue confidence-building measures\" and that it represented \"a clear step back\" away from a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nLast month, the Israeli government announced the legalisation of nine unauthorised outposts and approved the planning and building of more than 7,000 new housing units in existing settlements.\n\nBut at a meeting with Palestinian Authority officials in Egypt on Sunday, it reaffirmed a commitment to stop discussion of any new West Bank settlement homes for four months, and to stop authorisation of any outposts for six months.\n\nIt was part of a series of measures designed to calm tensions ahead of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, which is scheduled to start later this week and coincides with the Jewish festival of Passover and the Christian festival of Easter.\n\nThis move by Israeli lawmakers will be viewed as being at odds with that pledge.\n\nThere has been a surge of violence between Israel and the Palestinians in the West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem this year.\n\nAt least 88 Palestinians - militants and civilians - have been killed by Israeli forces, and on the Israeli side, 16 people have been killed in Palestinian attacks, all civilians, except for a paramilitary police officer.\n\nOn Monday, there was widespread condemnation of a claim made by Israel's Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich that \"there is no such thing as Palestinians\".\n\nMr Smotrich, the leader of the far-right ultranationalist Religious Zionism party and a key figure in the governing coalition, told a conference in Paris that Arabs \"invented fictitious people in order to fight the Zionist movement\", and that the remarks \"needed to be heard in the White House\".\n\nPalestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammed Shtayyeh strongly criticised the speech, saying it provided \"conclusive evidence of the extremist, racist Zionist ideology that governs the parties of the current Israeli government\".\n\nJordan, meanwhile, complained that a map used on the conference stage, which appeared to depict the country and the Palestinian territories as part of Israel, violated a 1994 peace treaty.\n\nThe Israeli foreign ministry later stressed in a tweet that there had \"been no change in the position of the State of Israel, which recognizes the territorial integrity of the Hashemite Kingdom\".\n\nEarlier this month, Mr Smotrich called for the Palestinian town of Hawara in the northern West Bank to be \"wiped out\" after two settlers were shot dead there by a Palestinian gunman and settlers attacked the town and nearby villages in response.\n\nHe later said he regretted the comment, and called it \"a slip of the tongue\".", "People in Taiwan alarmed at China's latest military drills have found a symbolic way of turning a geopolitical tussle into a bear-knuckle fight.\n\nA popular new badge depicts a Taiwanese black bear punching Winnie the Pooh, who often appears in memes representing Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\n\nThe fad began among air force pilots, but has since gone viral.\n\nTaiwan is a self-ruled island with its own government and constitution, but China sees it as a breakaway province.\n\nOn Monday, China finished three days of military drills around Taiwan, which included \"sealing off\" the island and simulating targeted strikes.\n\nBeijing began the exercises on Saturday after Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen met US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in California.\n\nAfter the drills ended, Taiwan's defence ministry said it would not stop strengthening its combat preparedness.\n\nImages and videos released by the ministry to back up its stance included the sight of a pilot wearing a sew-on patch of the battling bears -

However, for companies like Unilever, which have a significant physical presence in the country, exiting is not straightforward.\"\n\nThe company, which employs around 3,000 people in Russia, said that if it were to abandon its brands in Russia, \"they would be appropriated - and then operated - by the Russian state\".\n\nThe consumer goods giant said it had been unable to find a way to sell the business that \"avoids the Russian state potentially gaining further benefit, and which safeguards our people\".\n\nIt said there were no \"desirable\" options, but that continuing to run the business with \"strict constraints\" was the best way forward in the circumstances.\n\nThis week, Shell was criticised for continuing to trade in Russian gas more than a year after pledging to withdraw from the Russian energy market.\n\nThe oil giant said the trades were the result of \"long-term contractual commitments\" and do not violate laws or sanctions.", "Michael Allen has been named as the man who died at the scene\n\nTributes have been paid to a man stabbed to death near a nightclub on Sunday whom police have named as Michael Allen, 32.\n\nMr Allen was confirmed dead at the scene close to the Eclipse venue on Castle Canyke Road in Bodmin, Cornwall, following reports of a street brawl.\n\nSeven men and women with suspected stab wounds were taken to hospital.\n\nPolice have been granted by magistrates more time to question a man, 24, in connection with their murder inquiry.\n\nPolice investigations are continuing in the area\n\nThe family of Mr Allen, from Liskeard, said he was a \"much-loved son, brother, grandson, and uncle who loved his dogs\".\n\nThe family wished to \"respectfully request privacy at this time\", their statement added.\n\nThe suspect, also from Bodmin, has been arrested on suspicion of murder, attempted murder and causing grievous bodily harm with intent.\n\nOfficers were called to the scene at 03:15 BST on Sunday.\n\nOf the seven people injured, five have since been released and two remain in hospital recovering from surgery.\n\nBodmin Rugby Club have set up a tribute site for people to remember Michael Allen\n\nA tribute site has been set up at Bodmin Rugby Club, where Mr Allen was a player, for people to gather and remember him.\n\nOfficers will be in attendance to support the local community between 16:00 and 18:00 BST on Monday, and twice daily from 10:00 to 12:00 and then 16:00 to 18:00 for the next week.\n\nThe club said Mr Allen's \"humour and kindness has left a mark on us all, and we will miss him dearly\".\n\nDet Insp Ilona Rosson said police would \"continue to ask the public for their help\" in the investigation.\n\nShe said: \"If you have any information relating to this murder and have yet to have spoken with the police, please come forward immediately.

The judge said the phone-hacking claim was therefore too late.\n\nA spokesperson for NGN called the ruling a \"significant victory\" for the company.\n\nThey said: \"The judge, Mr Justice Fancourt, found his claims in relation to the alleged 'secret agreement' were not plausible or credible.\n\nHugh Grant is also taking legal action against NGN\n\n\"It is quite clear there was never any such agreement and it is only the Duke who has ever asserted there was.\"\n\nBut the judge ruled that there should be a trial around other alleged methods used to get information about Harry, identified in the ruling as \"blagging of confidential information from third parties, and instructing private investigators to do these or other unlawful acts\".\n\nThe judge said Harry had a \"realistically arguable\" case that he did not know enough about any use of the methods back in September 2013, the point at which NGN argue that his six-year window to bring a claim began.\n\nHarry says he did not have enough information to bring a claim until 2018.\n\nThursday's ruling does not take a position on whether Harry waited too long to bring a valid claim, only that \"it is not sufficiently clear at this stage that it was issued too late\" and should be decided at trial.\n\nThe trial could feature \"many other\" claimants, including actor Hugh Grant, and is due to start in January 2024, although could run into 2025.\n\nHarry's legal action against the Sun is one of three major claims he is making against the publishers of British tabloids.\n\nHe gave unprecedented testimony in court last month as part of his claim against the Mirror Group, and is also attempting to sue the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday over alleged breaches of privacy.", "Two of the three candidates vying to be leader of the SNP want an independent auditor to oversee the leadership vote.\n\nKate Forbes' campaign manager, MSP Michelle Thomson, said concerns had been raised about the integrity of the ballot process.\n\nAsh Regan said an auditor would provide transparency to party members and the public.\n\nThe SNP has so far refused to say how many party members will be able to take part in the leadership vote.\n\nThat is despite all three candidates in the contest - Ms Forbes, Ms Regan and Health Secretary Humza Yousaf - calling on it to do so.\n\nThe SNP's national secretary, Lorna Finn, has written to the candidates to address their concerns about transparency.\n\nShe said it was not clear to her what their concerns were, but she was \"satisfied as to the integrity of the ballot\".\n\nThe ballot, she said, is being managed by an independent company, Mi-Voice, which the SNP has used for internal contests since 2013.\n\n\"No-one in HQ has access to live data from the ballot or any Mi-Voice systems, and no-one will know the result until it is provided to me by Mi-Voice on 27 March,\" the national secretary wrote.\n\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon told the BBC she also had no doubts about the integrity of the voting system.\n\nSNP president Michael Russell said he has told Ms Finn that he supports publishing the membership figures, but has said he was \"disgusted by the abuse directed at SNP staff by individuals who damage our cause and aid our enemies\".\n\nThe national secretary said she had asked the SNP's executive committee to release the membership figures on Thursday.\n\nThe party had previously said it would only make the figure public after the result of the vote is announced on 27 March, but senior SNP sources are understood to be confident publication will be brought forward.\n\nThe SNP said its membership had reached 125,000 by 2019, but the Electoral Commission put the figure at 104,000 two years later.\n\nThe Mail on Sunday reported that Southampton-based polling firm Mi-Voice, which is overseeing the leadership vote, had been given the names of just 78,000 members by the SNP.\n\nMs Regan has called for transparency in an open letter, also written on behalf of Ms Forbes, to SNP chief executive officer Peter Murrell - who is the husband of Ms Sturgeon.\n\nMr Murrell was urged to clarify how many \"paid-up\" members the party has, and the number of digital and postal voting papers that have been released.\n\nIt is widely believed that Mr Yousaf is the preferred candidate of Ms Sturgeon and the wider party hierarchy, with Ms Regan previously claiming that his supporters were being \"bussed in\" to hustings events by SNP HQ.\n\nCandidate Humza Yousaf has also asked for clarity over party membership\n\nMs Regan told BBC Scotland she would like to see the appointment of an independent election monitor to ensure the vote is fair.\n\n\"My concern is that the membership of the SNP and the country need to have full transparency and honesty in the process,\" she said.\n\n\"So the fact that all the teams haven't been given something as simple as the number of members in the SNP is obviously a concern.\"\n\nMs Thomson, who is supporting Ms Forbes, said some concerns that had been raised about the ballot were \"based on hearsay or are from bad faith actors\".\n\nHowever others had been expressed by longstanding party members, she added.\n\nShe said she had written two letters to the party's national secretary but had not yet had a response.\n\nMichelle Thomson confirmed she had asked for the appointment of an independent auditor\n\nIn a statement Ms Thomson said: \"There seems to be a perception that the third party company operating the ballot process is a) independent and b) are responsible for the entire process.\n\n\"This is not the case - they are simply a company contracted by the SNP to provide services to their client's specification.

But it was a big one as Sexton thumped a penalty between the sticks to surpass Ronan O'Gara as the competition's record scorer.\n\nWhile Sexton's record-breaking penalty settled a few nerves, Sheehan's score produced a massive roar from the Aviva crowd, the hooker crossing after a well-worked set-piece that saw Josh van der Flier breaking from a line-out maul.\n\nWith Sheehan having given Ireland a much-needed shot in the arm, things went from bad to worse for England on the cusp of half-time when Steward was sent off after colliding with Hugo Keenan.\n\nAfter an Irish pass went forwards, Keenan stooped to pick up the loose ball. The on-rushing Steward turned sideways at the last moment and Keenan's head collided with the England full-back's arm, with referee Jaco Peyper ruling that the contact merited a red card.\n\nDespite their numerical disadvantage, England refused to lie down in the second half, and moved to within a point when Farrell booted his third penalty between the posts.\n\nBut Ireland managed to regain control and exerted enough pressure to prise open holes in the English defence, with Henshaw able to slip through before Sheehan's second score seemingly put the hosts out of England's reach.\n\nTo their credit, England continued to plug away and scored their only try when George crashed over, but after the visitors' Jack Willis was sin-binned, replacement Irish hooker Herring stretched to score his first Six Nations try and complete a famous triumph for Ireland.\n\nWhile England head coach Steve Borthwick can take heart that his side delivered on their promise to show more fight than they did against France, a fourth-place finish is a stark reminder of the task facing Eddie Jones' successor.\n\nIn contrast, Ireland will now approach the World Cup later this year with relish as they look to progress past the quarter-finals of rugby's quadrennial showpiece for the first time.\n\nThat is all to come.

It also denies planning strikes to impact Eurovision.\n\nMerseyrail, which operates trains around Liverpool, said it was unaffected by Saturday's strikes and would run late night services.\n\nMost train companies travelling to and from Liverpool had a limited service as a result of the strike action, according to National Rail.\n\nSpeaking at a picket line outside London Euston station, Mr Lynch said was the last Saturday of the union's six-month mandate in which it could strike.\n\nHe then told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme: \"We've not targeted Wembley or Liverpool or any of the activities that people get up to\" - a reference to both Eurovision and to the football National League play-off final at Wembley on Saturday afternoon.\n\nHe said the union \"wouldn't target a cup final\", but did not rule out considering strikes taking place on 3 June, when the men's FA Cup final and Scottish Cup final will be held.\n\nFuture strike dates could be announced as early as next week, he said, adding that the union was available to meet with the government and employers at any time to try to agree a deal.\n\nHe has written to the transport secretary calling for an special summit between ministers, train companies and unions to end chaos on the railways.\n\nIn a statement, the Department for Transport said RMT members should be allowed to vote on the latest pay offer.\n\n\"Since coming into office, ministers have met with the RMT leadership four times and helped facilitate three fair pay offers from employers,\" it said.\n\n\"It's now time for unions to give their members democratic say on their future.\"\n\nThe following rail operators will be impacted:\n\nThe Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents 14 train companies, said rail users should plan ahead and check services before travel.

A revised offer from Network Rail, which owns and operates the UK's railway infrastructure, was accepted by RMT members on 20 March, ending that separate dispute.\n\nAslef drivers will strike again on 31 May and 3 June, affecting services across on the day of the FA Cup final in England and the Scottish Cup final.\n\nHow are you affected by the latest round of rail strikes?

Many expressed anger over the abandonment of Afghans and of US weaponry.\n\nSome lessons had been learned from the end of the war in Afghanistan, especially around the failure to predict the sudden collapse of the Afghan government, Mr Kirby said.\n\nHe added this had influenced the US policy of supporting Ukraine ahead of Russia's invasion.\n\nAt a heated White House press briefing, Mr Kirby was forced to defend the timing of the release just ahead of a holiday weekend in the US.\n\nPushed on whether any officials involved with the withdrawal would be removed from their posts as a result of the report, Mr Kirby said its purpose \"is not accountability\".", "People walk from an RNLI boat on Dungeness beach in April 2023\n\nLifeboats were launched to rescue migrants in the English Channel 290 times last year, the RNLI has said.\n\nThe charity has published details of its work on migrant crossings for the first time.\n\nThe RNLI, which has been criticised as running a \"taxi service\" for migrants, said it had saved 108 lives in the Channel, between France and the Kent coast.\n\nIts chief executive said he made no apology for saving lives at sea.\n\nLifeboats, which are staffed by volunteer crews, were launched more than 9,000 times around the coast of the UK and Ireland in 2022.\n\nRescues of migrants in the Channel were launched 290 times, meaning small boat crossings now make up 3% of the RNLI's work.\n\nCrews are facing increasingly traumatic scenes when they are sent to rescue a small boat.\n\nSimon Ling, the RNLI's head of lifeboats, told the BBC: \"We've had babies thrown at our lifeboats, women screaming, men screaming.\n\n\"It's a very chaotic situation. Our crews are trained how to manage that and how to quickly get into rescue mode.\"\n\nA total of 1,100 small boats made the crossing last year, according to a count kept by BBC News, meaning a lifeboat was called to rescue about one in every four of them.\n\nThere were some deaths, including when a boat capsized in December, killing four people.\n\nHelp from the charity's 238 lifeboat stations is requested by coastguard officers.\n\nLifeboats from nine stations around the Sussex and Kent coast, from Hastings to Whitstable, are those most frequently involved in migrant rescues.\n\nThe former UKIP leader Nigel Farage has criticised the RNLI as a \"taxi service for illegal immigration\", although the response to such public criticism has included an increase in donations.\n\nThe charity's annual report for 2022 reveals a net increase in income of 3.5%, some of which came from higher donations - although costs also rose.\n\nSome of the money has been spent on developing a new device called \"sea stairs\", a floating platform which allows crews to rescue people from the water more quickly.\n\nMr Ling described the floating platform as a \"game-changer\".\n\nHe said a traditional rescue of a stricken small boat would take about one minute per person, while the sea stairs allowed 20 people to be taken from the water in 90 seconds.\n\nMonday's total of 616 people coming across in small boats means 8,380 migrants have made the crossing so far in 2023.", "A cryptocurrency project described as being \"dystopian\" has been launched by AI entrepreneur Sam Altman.\n\nWorldcoin gives people digital coins in exchange for a scan of their eyeballs.\n\nIn sites around the world thousands of people queued to gaze into silver orbs on day one of the project's full launch.\n\nThe BBC visited a scanning site in London where people received free crypto tokens after going through the process.\n\nMr Altman, the chief executive of Open AI which built chat bot ChatGPT says he hopes the initiative will help confirm if someone is a human or a robot.\n\n\"Worldcoin could drastically increase economic opportunity, scale a reliable solution for distinguishing humans from AI online while preserving privacy,\" Mr Altman claimed in a launch letter on the company website.\n\nWorldcoin also claims that its system could pave the way for an \"AI-funded\" universal basic income. But it's not clear how.\n\nThe concept of a universal basic income sees all citizens paid a set salary regardless of their means.\n\nThe first step in this crypto utopia as laid out by Worldcoin though relies on getting millions, maybe even billions, of people to scan their irises to prove they are a human.\n\nSince testing of the scanners began two years ago, Worldcoin says more than two million people have been added to the crypto database in 33 different countries.\n\nAccording to the company most sign ups have happened in Europe, India and southern Africa.\n\nDespite the company's American foundation, the crypto coins are not being offered to US citizens due to regulatory concerns.\n\nNow that the project has fully launched and the crypto tokens are available to claim and to trade, it's expected to grow even more popular.\n\nWorldcoin posted a picture online of people queuing at a site in Japan and said it plans to roll out 1,500 Orbs in locations across the globe.\n\nThe BBC went to try it out at a pop-up site in east London and found a steady stream of people turning up.\n\nThe process starts with scanning your face and iris to prove you are a person. It takes about 10 seconds to stare into the Orb's camera lens and wait for a beep to confirm it has worked. Interestingly the Orb operator says the silver ball used to talk to users - but customer feedback described it as \"creepy\" so they removed the voice.\n\nThe next step is that your iris scan is given a unique number which is checked against the giant database to make sure it's the first time you've done it. If so, the ball beeps again and you are now on the database along with 2.06 million other humans at the time of writing.\n\n25 free Worldcoin tokens are awarded on completion which are currently valued at roughly $2 (\u00a31.56) each. The BBC will sell the coins once they are received and donate any money to Children in Need.\n\nBy the time the BBC left the pop up site, 13 people had been scanned. All were men in their 20s and 30s.\n\n\"I came after seeing Sam Altman tweeting about the launch,\" said 37-year-old Moses Serumaga.\n\n'It's good to be early to these things,' said Moses Serumaga after getting his iris scanned in exchange for crypto tokens.\n\n\"I saw that you could get some dollars for it so I thought why not? It could die like other crypto projects or it could be a big thing and go up in value. I didn't want to miss out,\" he said.\n\n23-year-old Tom also scanned his eyeball but said he didn't do it for the money as he doesn't think the value of the tokens will rise.\n\n\"I don't think that amount of money is enough of an incentive unless you live in less developed nations and I don't think there's much possibility of it going up further really,\" he said.\n\nThe scanning process has proven controversial with reports criticising some of the tactics used by orb operators who are paid in commission, with particular concern over those getting sign ups in poorer nations.\n\nPrivacy experts also worry that sensitive data gathered from scanning a person's iris might get in to the wrong hands, even though Worldcoin insists that no data is stored.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin wrote a lengthy blog about his concerns and optimism about Worldcoin\n\nVitalik Buterin, the co founder of cryptocurrency network Ethereum, responded to the Worldcoin launch expressing excitement about the project but also issuing a warning about its potential pitfalls.\n\n\"On the whole, despite the \"dystopian vibez\" of staring into an Orb and letting it scan deeply into your eyeballs, it does seem like specialized hardware systems can do quite a decent job of protecting privacy,\" he said.\n\nHowever, he also says that relying on the specialised orbs to carry out the scans could give Worldcoin too much power and make it hard to get the world on-board.\n\nTwitter founder and crypto enthusiast Jack Dorsey tweeted an apparent criticism of the project, describing its mission as \"cute\", and adding the dystopian warning: \"Visit the Orb or the Orb will visit you...\".\n\nMr Altman welcomed criticism, saying online that \"haters\" give his team energy. But he admitted the project was ambitious.\n\n\"Maybe it works out and maybe it doesn't, but trying stuff like this is how progress happens,\" he tweeted.", "Smoke was pictured billowing over hills on the Spanish island on Saturday\n\nThousands of residents of La Palma in the Canary Islands have been urged to leave their homes as emergency workers try to bring a wildfire under control.\n\nThe blaze began early on Saturday and has already consumed 4,500 hectares (11,100 acres) of land and at least a dozen homes.\n\nAround 400 troops from various agencies are on the ground tackling the blaze.\n\nOfficials said some 4,255 people had been evacuated but that others were declining to leave.\n\nIt comes less than two years after a volcano erupted on the island, destroying thousands of homes.\n\nFernando Clavijo, president of the Canary Islands regional government, said there was \"resistance to abandoning the houses\" but that the priority had to be saving lives.\n\n\"People come first, then the houses, and then [extinguishing the fire],\" he said.\n\nThe blaze began in the area of El Pinar in the north-western municipality of Puntagorda, before spreading south towards the town of Tijarafe.\n\nMr Clavijo attributed its quick spread to \"the wind, the climate conditions as well as the heatwave that we are living through\".\n\nLate on Saturday, he said its progress had slowed but that it remained out of control.\n\nA seaplane was used to tackle the fire before nightfall.

His mother was Scottish, his grandmother was Scottish and I think Scotland is an important part of the United Kingdom.\"", "Russian state-controlled TV has embarked on an apparent campaign to discredit Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin in the wake of his failed mutiny in late June.\n\nKey channels showed what they said were images taken during searches at his opulent home outside St Petersburg, arguing that his riches reflected very badly on him.\n\nThey also recalled his criminal past and suggested that he was driven by greed, but failed to mention Prigozhin's persistent and often crude criticism of Russia's military and of how it pursues the war in Ukraine.\n\nThis is the first time that the state media machine's reporting of Prigozhin has been so prolific, so personal and so full of damaging details about his biography.\n\nUntil recently, Russian TV would portray a positive image of the Wagner mercenary group, which has fought alongside the Russian military during its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nPhotos said to be from inside Prigozhin's house appeared on state-run network Rossiya 1 on 5 July.\n\nOfficials released shots of what they said was the opulent interior of Prigozhin's home\n\n\"Let's have a look how this fighter for the truth lived, someone who has two criminal convictions and who kept claiming that everyone else was a thief,\" said a commentator on 60 Minutes, a talk show.\n\n\"Let's have a look at the palace built for this campaigner against corruption and crime,\" Eduard Petrov said sarcastically.\n\nThe footage showed piles of cash, various weapons, the house's opulent interiors and vast gardens - complete with a parked helicopter, an assortment of wigs and apparently fake passports issued to Prigozhin in different names.\n\nA cupboard of wigs was pictured during the alleged raid on Prigozhin's house\n\nLater, similar footage was shown as part of the channel's main evening news bulletin, one of the most popular in Russia. It also featured ingots of gold and \"suspicious packets of white powder\", which Rossiya 1 suggested could be an illegal drug.\n\nIt also dwelt at length on Prigozhin's criminal past.\n\nHe received his first criminal conviction in 1979, aged just 18, and got a suspended two-and-a-half year sentence for theft. Two years later, he was sentenced to 13 years in jail for robbery and theft, nine of which he served behind bars.\n\n\"They say that it is the experience and connections he received from crime lords behind bars which helped him walk the path from a hot dog seller to an authoritative master of cauldrons and pans,\" Rossiya 1's correspondent quipped, referring to Prigozhin's past role as a caterer for the Kremlin.\n\nThis role also earned him the nickname \"Kremlin's chef\".\n\nOne of the photos shown by Russian state TV showed a sledgehammer with the inscription \"Use in case of important negotiations\". This appears to be a reference to the brutal killing with a sledgehammer of a man Wagner accused of betrayal in November 2022.\n\nWriting on the sledgehammer appeared to read: \"In case of important negotiations.\"\n\nOn the same evening, state TV's Channel One suggested that Yevgeny Prigozhin was linked to Western intelligence, which was now \"too shy\" to admit involvement in his apparent mutiny.\n\nNTV, one of Russia's three most-watched television stations, argued that he was driven by greed and criminal past.\n\n\"What happened has obvious roots in his personality, business interests and his crime-ridden past,\" it said. As for Prigozhin's alleged riches, \"fighting for truth costs a lot of money\", NTV quipped.\n\nUntil several months after the start of Russia's full-scale war on Ukraine, officials, media and Prigozhin's own press service denied Wagner existed.\n\nFor a period of time afterwards, state TV celebrated Wagner's involvement in the \"special military operation\" in Ukraine.\n\nMentions of Wagner had all but disappeared from state media by the time Prigozhin embarked on his \"march for justice\", vowing to punish Russian military commanders whom he accused of incompetence.\n\nVast quantities of cash and gold bars were also reportedly found in the search\n\nPrigozhin himself, who has fallen almost completely silent on social media after his apparent mutiny, has not commented on the images.\n\nBut one channel linked to Wagner argued that it was not unusual for a businessman as wealthy as Prigozhin to own an expensive home: \"What's the wow factor here, then?\" it asked.\n\nAfter previously denying there were any links between Wagner and the state, President Vladimir Putin - speaking shortly after Prigozhin's mutiny failed - said the state fully funded the military company, spending an equivalent of about $1bn (\u00a3787m) on it in May 2022 to May 2023 alone.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Ros Atkins considers the key questions over the whereabouts of Yevgeny Prigozhin", "Adam Price took over as party leader in autumn 2018\n\nAdam Price said Plaid Cymru's \"time has come\" when he took over as leader five years ago.\n\nHis victory was not unexpected - with his imposing presence and strong oratory skills, Mr Price had long been regarded as a future leader.\n\nBut he departs after a report heavily criticised the workplace culture that existed in his party, alleging harassment, bullying and misogyny.\n\nA miner's son from the Amman Valley, Adam Price's politics were shaped by the long miners' strike of the mid-1980s.\n\nHe became an MP in 2001, representing Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, and made his mark in Westminster by leading an unsuccessful attempt to impeach the then prime minister, Tony Blair, over claims that Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction.\n\nMr Price stood down as an MP in 2010 before going to study at the prestigious Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University in the US.\n\nIn 2016 he returned to frontline politics - this time in Cardiff Bay, still representing his home constituency.\n\nOne campaign leaflet that year famously described him as an \"X-factor politician\" and the \"mab darogan\" (the son of prophecy) - a figure from Welsh mythology who it is said will redeem Wales in its hour of need.\n\nAdam Price and other party leaders meeting the Prince of Wales at the Senedd last year\n\nTwo years later he ousted Leanne Wood and became the first openly gay leader of a Welsh political party.\n\nMr Price described the decision to challenge one of his \"oldest friends in politics\" as \"the most difficult thing I've had to wrestle with in my political life\".\n\nMs Wood would later tell the BBC that the move led to the collapse of their friendship.\n\nIn a departure from his predecessor's approach, Mr Price put the notoriously tricky subject of independence at the heart of his political plan, pledging to hold a referendum on the issue by 2030.\n\nBut at the snap general election of December 2019 the party found itself squeezed out of the Brexit-dominated debate, and though Plaid held on to its four seats in Westminster, its share of the vote fell back and it came a disappointing third in its main target seat of Ynys M\u00f4n.\n\nLabour First Minister Mark Drakeford and Adam Price signed a co-operation deal in late 2021\n\nAnd so to the 2021 Senedd election, where independence would be front and centre of the party's campaign.\n\nAhead of the vote, Mr Price said that he would count anything less than becoming first minister as a \"failure\", and he ruled out working with the Conservatives and joining a coalition with Labour as a junior partner.\n\nBut the party slipped back into third place, losing its grip on the Rhondda seat held by Ms Wood, as it struggled to compete with the favourable response towards the Labour First Minister Mark Drakeford's leadership during the pandemic.\n\nMonths later, and with Mr Drakeford having fallen just short of a majority in the Senedd, Mr Price formed a co-operation agreement with the Welsh Labour government.\n\nThis was to be a new kind of deal, and one which would allow Plaid Cymru to push through some of its key policies, including Senedd expansion, the extension of free school meals, and free childcare for two year-olds.\n\nAnd that's why in the run-up to last May's Welsh local elections Mr Price - by now a father of two young children - was able to claim his party was \"making a difference\", and had \"snatched a moral victory from the mawing jaws of defeat\".\n\nBy the end of the year the party was engulfed by claims of a toxic culture within Plaid and criticism of the leadership's handling of the situation.\n\nThat culminated in a report by Nerys Evans which said the party had tolerated \"too many instances of bad behaviour\".\n\nMr Price initially insisted he would remain in post, arguing that quitting would be \"abdicating\" his responsibility.\n\nHowever a week on Mr Price has announced that he will step down and so it will be up to his successor to address the issues raised by the report and set a course for the party into the general election.", "The White House has called Fox News presenter Tucker Carlson \"not credible\" after he made a number of claims based on previously unseen footage from the 2021 Capitol riots.\n\nThe criticism echoes similar statements this week from leading Democrat and Republican lawmakers.\n\nMr Carlson showed unseen clips from the riots on his show this week.\n\nHe argued the footage \"does not show an insurrection or a riot in progress\" but rather \"mostly peaceful chaos\".\n\nA top congressional Republican recently gave Mr Carlson and his team exclusive access to more than 40,000 hours of surveillance video from the Capitol.\n\nThe White House rarely criticises journalists by name but weighed in with a statement on Wednesday about the prime-time TV host's broadcast related to the footage.\n\nSpokesperson Andrew Bates said the White House agreed with critics, including the \"chief of the Capitol Police and the wide range of bipartisan lawmakers\" that \"condemned this false depiction of the unprecedented, violent attack\".\n\n\"We also agree with what Fox News's own attorneys and executives have now repeatedly stressed in multiple courts of law: that Tucker Carlson is not credible.\"\n\nOn his Wednesday broadcast, Mr Carlson showed no new footage but repeated his previous claims and criticised government officials who stated that five police officers died as a result of the riot.\n\nOne Capitol Police officer died of a stroke the day after the riot, while four others subsequently took their own lives.\n\nMr Carlson, the top-rated host on conservative Fox News, has long insisted that other media outlets exaggerated violence at the Capitol on 6 January 2021, when Trump supporters stormed the complex as lawmakers met to certify Joe Biden's victory in the presidential election.\n\nHe has also suggested, without evidence, that government agents could have instigated the riot.\n\nIn the roughly 45-minute segment, Mr Carlson said the video showed that while a minority of protesters did commit violence, most were \"sightseers\".\n\nHis show on Tuesday night included an interview with Tarik Johnson, a former Capitol Police officer who said he donned a pro-Trump red hat during the riot in order to help fellow officers escape the melee.\n\nMr Carlson questioned why intelligence about possible violence that day wasn't relayed to rank-and-file officers, but he did not broadcast much new video from the riot.\n\nCriticism of Fox News reporting came from Democrats as well as top Republicans in Washington, the head of the Capitol police, and the family of a police officer whose death was mentioned by Mr Carlson in the show.\n\nSenate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday it had been a \"mistake for Fox News to depict this in a way that's completely at variance with what our chief law enforcement official here at the Capitol thinks\" about the riot.\n\nMr McConnell pointed to an internal memo by Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger, whose agency is responsible for protecting the buildings where the lawmakers meet.\n\nIn that memo, Mr Manger says the primetime Monday broadcast was \"filled with offensive and misleading conclusions about the January 6 attack\".\n\n\"The programme conveniently cherry-picked from the calmer moments of our 41,000 hours of video,\" he wrote.\n\n\"The commentary fails to provide context about the chaos and violence that happened before or during these less tense moments.\"\n\nDuring Monday's programme, the Fox host showed footage of the \"QAnon Shaman\" - a man named Jacob Chansley and also known as Jake Angeli - wandering around the Capitol building trailed by police officers who show no signs, at least in the clips broadcast, of attempting to stop or arrest him.\n\nChansley, who was bare-chested and wearing a headdress made of fur and horns that day, became one of the most recognisable figures from the Capitol riot.\n\nHe pleaded guilty in September 2021 to obstructing an official proceeding and is currently serving a 41-month prison sentence.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Jacob Chansley spoke from jail about his role in the Capitol riots.\n\nMr Carlson said the videos - which have not been viewed by the BBC or any other media organisation in full - showed that police had acted as Chansley's \"tour guide\".\n\nThis version of events was rejected by Mr Manger, who called the allegation \"outrageous and false\".\n\n\"Those officers did their best to use de-escalation tactics to try to talk rioters into getting each other to leave the building,\" he wrote.\n\nThe justice department says about 140 police officers were assaulted that day.\n\nAround 1,000 people have been arrested so far in connection with the riot, most of them charged with entering or remaining in a restricted federal building, according to justice department figures.\n\nMore than 300 have been charged with assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers or employees, including more than 100 who have been charged with using a deadly or dangerous weapon or causing serious bodily injury to a police officer.\n\nMr Carlson also focused on Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who collapsed after returning to his office during the siege and died the next day.\n\nFox News showed footage of Mr Sicknick continuing to perform his duties inside the Capitol after being pepper-sprayed.\n\n\"Whatever happened to Brian Sicknick was very obviously not to do with the violence he suffered outside the Capitol,\" Mr Carlson said.\n\nIn April 2021, a medical examiner found that Mr Sicknick had died of natural causes from a medical condition not brought on by an injury.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr Sicknick's family issued a statement saying they were \"outraged\" at the coverage and lambasted the network as \"propaganda\".", "Jenner Ellis with daughter Tanya in Florence in 2005\n\nWhen Jenner Ellis died of ovarian cancer in 2010 the specific mutation of the BRCA1 gene linked to Orkney had not yet been identified.\n\nIt was known that certain mutations carried a higher risk of ovarian and breast cancer but the one Jenner had was not thought to be one of them.\n\nIt was years later that researchers contacted her husband and children to say they thought they had found a new high-risk gene mutation and it was the one Jenner had carried.\n\nAfter years of research, a study published last month suggests that one in 100 people with grandparents from Orkney has a specific mutation of the BRCA1 gene.\n\nIt found that most of them could trace their family ancestry back to the island of Westray.\n\nJenner grew up in Kirkwall on Orkney and her great grandparents were from Westray.\n\nJenner's husband Dennis and her daughter Tanya said it was important to get tested\n\nHer husband Dennis says that when Jenner was tested in 2010 they were told the BRCA1 mutation was not of any note or significance.\n\n\"At that time they did not know this other mutation had any medical effects,\" Dennis says.\n\n\"So there was a sense of relief which turned out to be unfortunately not based in reality.\"\n\nAll three of Jenner and Dennis's children were tested for the new Orkney mutation and found not to have it.\n\nThis included his son. Although men are at a lower risk from the gene mutation, they can pass it on to their children.\n\nDennis's daughter Tanya says she was in her late 20s and did not have children but was keen to take the genetic test.\n\nShe says testing is not something people usually want to go through but it is worth it to find out either way.\n\n\"The clarification that you don't carry it is great,\" she says.\n\n\"But then to know that you do gives you all those choices, whether it is preventative surgery or just being monitored.\"\n\nJenner and Tanya in Orkney in 2002\n\nDennis says it is also important to know whether you are passing the gene mutation to your children, an option his wife did not have.\n\nHe says if you don't have the gene mutation it can't be passed on.\n\n\"Both you and your children can breathe a big sigh of relief,\" he says.\n\nDennis says \"Ovarian cancer is the silent killer.

Hijackers had crashed two airliners into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center, and a third hit the Pentagon, the headquarters of the US Department of Defense.\n\nThe fourth plane crashed in Pennsylvania after a passenger revolt.\n\nA few months after the 9/11 attacks, the newly released files reveal Mr Blair was warmly praised by a political opponent - ex-Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher.\n\n\"I greatly admire the resolve you are showing,\" ran her handwritten note, dated April 2002. She said Mr Blair had shown Britain was a \"staunch defender of liberty\" and \"a loyal ally of America\".\n\n\"That is the very best reputation our country can have,\" she wrote, with the words firmly underlined in her blue felt pen.\n\nOther stories from the National Archives:\n\nBaroness Thatcher praised Tony Blair for his support of the US\n\nHowever, the papers reveal Mr Blair had earlier been given a stark warning about the terrorist threat to the UK.\n\nWriting privately to the prime minister in the days after the 9/11 attacks, Tory MP Sir John Stanley said it \"was not in the national security interest\" to put some of the points he wanted to raise in the public domain.\n\nSir John highlighted the 1995 Sarin attack on the Japanese underground, which had killed 12 people, and pointed out a 1998 Foreign Office intelligence assessment suggesting anthrax could kill millions in a British city.\n\nIt seemed \"well nigh certain\" that terrorist organisations would obtain a portable \"dirty\" nuclear device, he wrote, \"if they have not done so already\".\n\nThe 9/11 attacks prompted the then-Labour government to take immediate precautionary measures, boosting security at airports and government buildings. But Sir John Stanley believed there needed to be a more fundamental shift.\n\nHe urged the government to base security, civil defence, and intelligence policies on the assumption that \"a terrorist WMD attack on one or more of the centres of population in the UK will be attempted, and attempted in the near and foreseeable future\".\n\nHe said more money should go into national intelligence, and civil defence should be rebuilt to deal with the consequences of a WMD attack. There should be provision of vaccines, and anti-radiation supplies to increase the chances of survival in case of a biological chemical or nuclear attack, he wrote.\n\nSir John said there must be far closer surveillance and easier detention of suspect terrorists in the UK, and the government should have powers to determine security measures for building in private as well as public ownership.\n\nIain Duncan Smith, who had just become Conservative Party leader, followed up his colleague's letter, saying the view \"from such a source\" should be taken \"with great seriousness\".\n\nMr Blair responded by saying he had commissioned reviews of anti-terrorist measures immediately after the attack. He said it would take time to develop and introduce new systems but they'd be brought in \"as quickly as possible\".\n\nHe said the greatest threat was still from conventional attacks, rather than WMD.\n\nBehind the scenes the government did take action. Many of the points raised by Sir John were addressed, though it's unclear if his particular intervention made an impact.\n\nSir David Omand was security and intelligence coordinator [Permanent Secretary] in the Cabinet Office from 2002 and established the CONTEST counter terrorism strategy.\n\nEven before he arrived, work was well under way to prevent WMD attacks, or deal with them if they took place. For example, equipment was being developed to detect radioactive material at UK entry points - work which became known as \"Operation Cyclamen\".\n\nAnti-viral drugs were stockpiled and decontamination vehicles procured. The Prevent strategy was established to try to stop people supporting terrorism.\n\nAccording to Sir David, the emergency planning was often done quietly, because the government didn't want to \"put people in fear\".", "Helen Holland was critically injured in a crash with a police motorcycle escorting the Duchess of Edinburgh on Wednesday\n\nA woman who was critically injured in a crash with a police motorcycle escorting the Duchess of Edinburgh is in a coma in hospital, her family say.\n\nHelen Holland, 81, was hit at the junction of West Cromwell Road and Warwick Road in Earl's Court, west London, at 15:20 BST on Wednesday.\n\nHer family said they were \"shocked and sickened\" at her injuries.\n\nThe police watchdog said their investigation was in its early stages and evidence was being gathered.\n\nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct said Ms Holland was in a critical condition in hospital.\n\nMs Holland, from Birchanger, Essex, had been in London visiting her older sister on Wednesday, her family told the BBC.\n\nHer son and daughter-in-law Martin and Lisa-Marie Holland said they were \"shocked and sickened at her extensive injuries\".\n\n\"She is being well cared for by the NHS who we must thank deeply for their help in keeping her alive,\" they added.\n\nSophie, Duchess of Edinburgh, was \"grateful for the swift response of emergency services\", a Buckingham Palace spokesperson said\n\nA Buckingham Palace spokesperson said on Thursday the duchess was \"grateful for the swift response of emergency services and will keep abreast of developments\".\n\n\"Further comment at this time would not be appropriate while the incident is being investigated,\" they added.\n\nBuckingham Palace previously said the duchess's \"heartfelt thoughts and prayers are with the injured lady and her family\".\n\nThe Directorate of Professional Standards has been notified about the crash.\n\nFollow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Then along came Michael Cragg to dispel the myths.\n\nHis new book, Reach For The Stars, is a history of British pop from 1996 to 2006 that lays bare the \"mechanisms behind the manufactured pop juggernaut\".\n\nIt's a story of exploitation, exhaustion and even fist fights.\n\nClaire Richards from Steps recalls \"starving myself for four-and-a-half years because I was told I had to lose weight on day one\". Sugababe Mutya Buena was granted two weeks maternity leave before being shoved back \"in the studio, breastfeeding at 5am\". The boyband 5ive went from sharing a house to outright animosity in the space of 12 months.\n\n\"There were fist fights that spilled out into corridors,\" admits singer Ritchie Neville.\n\n\"The hours were brutal, and the schedule like no other,\" adds Hear'Say's Myleene Klass. \"No rock stars would be able to keep up. It's hardcore.\"\n\n5ive were designed as a \"rougher\" version of Boyzone - but they still got their own poseable dolls\n\nAnd when it all ended, the fallout was extreme.\n\n\"Not knowing what was next was a huge shock,\" says S Club 7's Jo O'Meara.\n\n\"[S Club] was so military and then it stopped so quickly. We were told what to do, told where to go, told when I'm eating. I didn't know how to be without it.\"\n\nCragg, who has written for Vogue, GQ and The Guardian, spoke to more than 100 people for his book, uncovering scores of previously untold stories.\n\n\"I wanted to ask questions they weren't really asked at the time, when they were more likely to be asked what their favourite sandwich filling was,\" he says.\n\nHe discovered an industry that put \"punishing\" expectations on singers who'd barely left school.\n\n\"They were governed by the charts. If you didn't make the top five, it was like 'This is not enough.'\n\n\"I think now, people would be doing backflips if their debut single got to number eight, but back then there was a lot of money being spent, so the rewards had to be really high and quick.\"\n\nNot that bands necessarily saw any of those rewards.\n\nSugababes' Keisha Buchanan reveals that she \"got transferred \u00a33,000\" after the band signed \"a million-pound deal\".\n\n\"Even when the money was coming in,\" adds 5ive's Scott Robinson, \"we were given \u00a3100 a week\".\n\nSteps were described by producer Pete Waterman as \"Abba on speed\"\n\nThere was one exception, says Cragg, in the form of line-dancing pop behemoth Steps.\n\n\"They'd all been [Butlins] Redcoats or had other jobs, so they understood what was going on a tiny bit more,\" he says.\n\n\"They knew that if they went to America to support Britney Spears, that the money would be coming out of their budget, so they were reluctant to do it at first.\n\n\"And that's interesting because most other people would have (a) been told they had to do it or (b) would have jumped at the chance and not thought about the finances. But Steps were a slight anomaly.\"\n\nAlthough his book is presented as an oral history, Cragg's knowledge and affection for the music shines through every paragraph.\n\nThat's how he manages to unearth the real reason 5ive didn't get to record Baby... One More Time (they confidently told songwriter Max Martin it was awful), and to explain why the public turned against the original reality TV band Hear'Say.\n\n\"Popstars was done as a documentary, and people were incredibly upset when they launched as a band because they'd had a tiny makeover,\" he says.\n\n\"Suzanne got hair extensions and everyone was like, 'Oh my God, who she thinks she is?'\"\n\nRevisiting this decade-long flourish of British pop was more than just an academic exercise, however.\n\nAt the time, Cragg was a \"closeted teenager\" who hid his love of pop music behind a veneer of indie cool. In the opening prologue, he recounts making a pilgrimage to Dublin to see Scottish rockers Travis when, really, he wanted to gorge himself on Spice Girls memorabilia.\n\n\"I actually won those tickets,\" he says. \"I entered a competition and I won and I took my friend and we stayed in a youth hostel where I got hit by an inflatable armchair.\n\n\"It's such a dark time in my life. I was hiding away from this music because I thought it revealed too much of me.\"\n\nWriting the book was the first time he was able to \"look back at the music [and] be happy to embrace it fully. And that was quite exciting.\"\n\nCragg showed an early interest in journalism. As a child, he'd watch the TV news and write down the details. In the era of MySpace, he started blogging music reviews, then took a job selling adverts for The Guardian, where he eventually plucked up the courage to pitch a festival review.\n\n\"It just sort of rolled from there,\" he says, reminiscing about his first ever interview, with Texas rock band Midlake, \"one of whom was asleep\".\n\n\"I was overly-prepared. I had 14 pages of questions and I literally sat there and read them out. It was not ideal.\"\n\nSince then, he's honed his technique on everyone from Lady Gaga and Katy Perry to Miley Cyrus and Britney Spears.\n\n\"Once I started writing about pop music, I guess I jumped out of the closet,\" he laughs.\n\nMichael Cragg made up for lost time by spending an eBay fortune on 2000s pop memorabilia he missed the first time around\n\nOver the course of his career, the gravitational centre of music writing has shifted from glossy magazines to broadsheet newspapers, resulting in more serious-minded coverage. Nowadays, stars like Billie Eilish and Dua Lipa expected to have opinions on war and mental health and LGBTQ rights, instead of declaring their favourite colour.\n\nOur conversation takes a long detour into the merits of this approach. Has the press stripped pop music of its glamour? Or did old-school magazines do 5ive and Sugababes a disservice by papering over the mental health crises that forced their founding members to quit?\n\n\"I think the mental health situation with those bands was the responsibility of the record labels and the people around them, not the journalists who were trying to sell this fun pop era to fans,\" Cragg says.\n\n\"These days, if you're going to be on the cover of a broadsheet supplement, there's definitely a pressure to talk about these incredibly large and heavy issues - but if you go into an interview with Charli XCX and you talk about her mental health, is that helping Charli XCX, necessarily?\n\n\"Charli XCX is incredible. She's hilarious. She makes absolutely bonkers music. I want to know about that. I want to know, like, if I came around for dinner, what would she cook me? I think that's more interesting, as a fan.\"\n\nAs a result, Cragg insisted his book didn't just present the \"sad stories\" of pop.\n\n\"Even 5ive, whose career ended horribly when they were at their peak, have come to a place of acceptance and are able to look back on it fondly.\"\n\nWith S Club 7, Busted and Sugababes all on the comeback trail, the book arrives with auspicious timing. Unless, that is, you're Louis Walsh, who gave Cragg an unforgettable pull-quote for the dust jacket.\n\n\"Nobody buys books.

the latter playing on from a wild drive with the target 80 runs away, at which stage Australia were favourites.\n\nBrook, 24, has made his name as an attacking batter in his first 10 Tests - here becoming the quickest batter to 1,000 Test runs in terms of balls faced - but restrained himself while putting away the bad balls with the field spread.\n\nAt the other end, Woakes was more aggressive. He managed to slash the ball through the off side, although was fortunate to fend the short ball three times into empty spaces.\n\nWhen Brook top-edged a bouncer, Australia still had a sniff but Wood, who took seven wickets in the match bowling at extreme pace, hooked Cummins over fine leg en route to 16 not out.\n\nIt was fitting, however, that Woakes, who also contributed a crucial six wickets, hit the winning runs after 15 months out of the side.\n\nStarc almost wins it for Australia\n\nAfter starting on 27-0, England had added 15 runs relatively calmly amid the tension, before Ben Duckett was pinned lbw by Starc's left-arm pace for 23.\n\nThe hosts promoted Moeen Ali in Brook's place but he only made five before a Starc inswinger crashed into his leg stump.\n\nZak Crawley batted well for 44 but, in a dismissal that sums up his Test career, edged a big drive to Mitchell Marsh through to the wicketkeeper a ball after hitting the same shot through the covers.\n\nRoot attempted to pull a wayward ball from Cummins and gloved it down the leg side.\n\nStarc, though, was the major threat and was rewarded by having Stokes taken down the leg side before Bairstow's wild swish.\n\nAustralia missed the control of spinner Nathan Lyon, ruled out of the series with a calf injury last week, but have more than a week to regroup before seeking a series-clinching victory again.\n\nEngland batter Harry Brook on Test Match Special: \"I don't think I can quite believe it yet, to do it here in front of my home crowd.\n\n\"It's a phenomenal win and sets up the rest of the series.\"\n\nFormer England captain Michael Vaughan: \"Fantastic.

I spent 17 years on my guard against every threat.\n\n\"Seventeen years counting down the minutes to lock up, so I could be behind my door and safe from other prisoners, but not safe from my own mind, imagining I would die there, perhaps murdered.\n\nHis mother Trisha Hose said: \"For nearly 20 years people have assumed that I was just a loyal but deluded mother in denial about what my son was capable of doing.\n\n\"I knew the system had got it wrong, but it seemed like there was nothing I could do about it.\"\n\nNow he had been cleared, Ms Hose said she was \"no longer a deluded mother\" and her son was \"no longer a monster\".\n\n\"But what has been done to him cannot be undone,\" she said.\n\n\"The damage will be with him for the rest of his life, and the woman who got attacked has been denied justice, just as my son was.\"\n\nMr Malkinson was convicted of carrying out the rape in Salford in 2003\n\nOpening the appeal earlier, Mr Henry said: \"This is the most troubling case which may have wide implications for the administration of criminal justice.\n\n\"This is a historic case - and a historic injustice.\n\n\"Grave failures that must lie at the door of GMP that wholly undermined a fair trial.\"\n\n\"No-one else should have to go through what Mr Malkinson has endured.\"\n\nLord Justice Holroyde said other points argued by Mr Malkinson's legal team, about \"crucial\" material that was not disclosed at the time of his trial, \"raised a number of substantial and important points\".\n\nHe said the court would take time to consider them and give a decision on them later in writing.\n\nGreater Manchester Police has apologised for a \"grave miscarriage of justice\"\n\nGMP's Assistant Chief Constable Sarah Jackson said the force was \"truly sorry\" to Mr Malkinson over the \"grave miscarriage of justice\".\n\nShe said the force was \"also profoundly sorry to the victim of this crime, who not only suffered an horrific trauma 20 years ago, but also relived the experience during a criminal trial, and now may endure additional harm caused by learning that the true offender has not yet been brought to justice\".\n\nCases like Mr Malkinson's were \"thankfully very rare\", she said, but added that the force had and would continue to \"fully co-operate with any further reviews and action will be taken if it is found that anything could have been done differently\".\n\nShe said she had offered to meet Mr Malkinson \"to personally deliver this apology\".\n\n\"We are determined to work with our colleagues in the CPS to ensure all new evidence is fully examined and that the person truly responsible is convicted,\" she said.\n\nCCRC chairman Helen Pitcher said she welcomed the decision to overturn Mr Malkinson's conviction.\n\n\"In the ever-changing world of forensic science, new evidence can come to light years after a conviction,\" she said.\n\n\"We used our special powers to take advantage of DNA breakthroughs to find evidence that we considered could overturn this conviction.\n\n\"We recognise that Andrew has had a very long journey to clear his name, but sadly the evidence that led to the court overturning his conviction only became available years after his conviction.\"\n\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

MGN denies phone hacking in this case.\n\nHere are some key extracts from his statement which he is being challenged on in court by barristers on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\n\"In my experience as a member of the Royal Family, each of us gets cast into a specific role by the tabloid press.\n\n\"You start off as a blank canvas while they work out what kind of person you are and what kind of problems and temptations you might have.\n\n\"They then start to edge you towards playing the role or roles that suit them best and which sells as many newspapers as possible, especially if you are the 'spare' to the 'heir'.\n\n\"You're then either the 'playboy prince', the 'failure', the 'dropout' or, in my case, the 'thicko', the 'cheat', the 'underage drinker', the 'irresponsible drug taker', the list goes on.\n\n\"As a teenager and in my early 20s, I ended up feeling as though I was playing up to a lot of the headlines and stereotypes mainly because I thought that, if they are printing this rubbish about me and people were believing it, I may as well 'do the crime'.\n\n\"It was a downward spiral, whereby the tabloids would constantly try and coax me into doing something stupid that would make a good story and sell lots of newspapers.\n\n\"Looking back, such behaviour on their part is utterly vile.\"\n\nPrince Harry says journalists would blag information about his former girlfriend Chelsy Davy's flights to the UK to see him. The couple were in an on-off, sometimes long-distance, relationship for six years from 2004.\n\n\"I walked into the [airport] arrivals hall with a baseball cap on and immediately spotted five separate paparazzi sitting on benches with cameras in bags, their hands inside rucksacks and everyone else looking at me,\" says the prince.\n\n\"I remember that someone was videoing me with one of those tiny little cameras between their legs.\n\n\"I recall thinking how on earth did they know I was going to be there, but now it's obvious.\n\n\"Here were five big, burly and dodgy looking men, with their hands in their pockets or in rucksacks and satchels in a busy public place.\n\n\"My security and I simply couldn't know whether they were reaching for a camera or drawing some kind of weapon.\"\n\nChelsy Davy and Prince Harry were in an on-off relationship between 2004 and 2010\n\nHe adds: \"I always felt the tabloids wanted me to be single, as I was much more interesting to them and sold more newspapers.\n\n\"Whenever I got into a relationship, they were very keen to report the details but would then, very quickly, seek to try and break it up by putting as much strain on it and creating as much distrust as humanly possible.\n\n\"The twisted objective is still pursued to this day even though I'm now married.\"\n\n\"Tabloids would routinely publish articles about me that were often wrong but interspersed with snippets of truth.\n\n\"This created an alternative and distorted version of me to the general public - the people I had to serve and interact with as a member of the Royal Family - to the point where any one of the thousands of people that I met or was introduced to on any given day, could easily have gone: 'You know what, you're an idiot. I've read all the stories about you and now I'm going to stab you.\"\n\nPrince Harry on a walkabout in Edinburgh with his wife, Meghan Markle, in 2018\n\nPrince Harry says royal aides gave him his first phone when he went to Eton College, a boarding school in Windsor - and it became crucial to his daily life.\n\n\"As I was very heavily involved with various commitments, I would constantly be leaving and receiving voicemails, as text messaging was much less common back then,\" he says.\n\n\"It was my main means of communicating with my family [including my mother who I was obviously extremely close] ... my girlfriend at the time, my friends, members of the Royal Household and those I was working with.\n\n\"My voicemails would include incredibly private and sensitive information about my relationships, my operational security and that of my family [and in later years] my work both in the Army and as a senior member of the Royal Family.\"\n\nHe says knowing MGN journalists were listening in to private and sensitive voicemails suggests they could have heard \"anything and everything\".\n\nThis created huge stress, presented security concerns and created a \"huge amount of paranoia\" and suspicion in his relationships, he says.\n\n\"I felt I couldn't trust anybody, which was an awful feeling for me, especially at such a young age.\"\n\nThe King accompanied Prince Harry on his first day at Eton College in Berkshire\n\nPrince Harry says numerous papers had reported a rumour that his biological father was James Hewitt - a man his mother had a relationship with after he was born.\n\nAt the time, he says, he wasn't aware of the timeline. Aged 18 and having lost his mother six years earlier, he says such stories felt were \"hurtful, mean and cruel\".\n\n\"I was always left questioning the motives. Were the newspapers keen to put doubt into the minds of the public so I might be ousted from the Royal Family?\"\n\nJames Hewitt, a former cavalry officer, had a five-year affair with Princess Diana\n\nA 2003 article by The People detailed a disagreement between Prince Harry and his brother, the Prince of Wales, over a potential meeting with their mother's former butler, Paul Burrell. He says the pair had strong feelings about Mr Burrell's indiscretion after he sold their mother's possessions and conducted interviews about her.\n\n\"We firmly believed that she would have expected some privacy in death, especially from someone she had trusted,\" he says.\n\nWilliam had wanted to set up a meeting with him - Harry was firmly against it, having made up his mind about Mr Burrell.\n\nThe article said he believed him to be a \"two-faced shit\", a phrase he believes could have been lifted from a voicemail message.\n\nPaul Burrell said Princess Diana called him her rock\n\nBreaking with the convention that royals never interfere with politics, Prince Harry attacks Rishi Sunak's government in his statement.\n\n\"Our country is judged globally by the state of our press and our government - both of which I believe are at rock bottom.\n\n\"Democracy fails when your press fails to scrutinise and hold the government accountable, and instead choose to get into bed with them so they can ensure the status quo.\"\n\nPrince Harry says he is determined to see this action through to the end because he is convinced unlawful information gathering was known about by those at the top.\n\n\"The fact that it was not just the journalists who were carrying out the unlawful activity, but also those in power who were turning a blind eye to it so as to ensure that it would continue unabated - and who then tried to cover it up when the game was up - is appalling.\n\n\"The fact they're all ganging up to protect each other is the most disturbing part of all, especially as they're the mothership of online trolling.\n\n\"Trolls react and mobilise to stories they create. People have died as a result and people will continue to kill themselves by suicide when they can't see any other way out.\n\n\"How much more blood will stain their typing fingers before someone can put a stop to this madness.\"", "The UK's biggest business group has admitted it hired \"culturally toxic\" staff and failed to fire people who sexually harassed female colleagues.\n\nThe CBI said a failure to act allowed a \"very small minority\" of staff to believe they could get away with harassment or violence against women.\n\nThe embattled lobby group said it has now dismissed a number of people.\n\nThe CBI was responding to an independent law firm report on misconduct allegations including rape.\n\nIn an emotional letter to members, the business lobby group - which claims to represent 190,000 firms - admitted to a series of failings and said it had made mistakes \"that led to terrible consequences\".\n\nIt said there was a collective \"sense of shame\" at \"so badly having let down the...people who came to work at the CBI\".\n\n\"Our collective failure to completely protect vulnerable employees... and to put in place proper mechanisms to rapidly escalate incidents of this nature to senior leadership.... these failings most of all drive the shame,\" CBI president Brian McBride said in the letter.\n\nIn early April, a number of claims of misconduct and harassment against CBI staff emerged including one allegation of rape at the lobby group's summer party in 2019.\n\nOn Friday a second rape allegation emerged, after a woman told the Guardian she was raped whilst working at one of the CBI's overseas offices.\n\nBoth rape allegations are being investigated by the police.\n\nIn a letter following a report by law firm Fox Williams, which was appointed to lead an independent investigation into the lobby group, the CBI admitted to its members:\n\nThe future of the CBI is hanging in the balance and it has suspended its operations until June while it tries to reform its workplace.\n\nThere has been a mass exodus of CBI members, with a number of household names including John Lewis, BMW, Virgin Media O2, insurers Aviva, Zurich and Phoenix Group, banking firm Natwest, credit card company Mastercard; B&Q owner Kingfisher and media firm ITV all quitting the group.\n\nThe government had already decided to pause any activity with the lobby group, but on Monday, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said there was \"no point\" engaging with the CBI when its own members had deserted them.\n\n\"We want to engage with a body that speaks or business. It is incredibly important for me when I'm constructing budgets to have someone that I can turn to who speaks for British business.\"\n\nMr McBride said he wanted to give members reasons to consider trusting the lobby group again.\n\nBut said: \"Whether that is possible, I simply don't know.\"\n\nMr McBride said he was concerned that CBI staff felt that their only option was to go to the Guardian newspaper - which first published the claims - instead of feeling confident enough to raise the matter internally.\n\nOne female CBI worker had told the Guardian that she had been stalked by a male colleague in 2018.\n\nThe business group upheld a complaint of harassment against the man however, he was allowed to keep working in the same office as the woman. He eventually left for an unrelated reasons, according to the newspaper.\n\nEarlier this month, the lobby group fired its director-general, Tony Danker, who joined the CBI in 2020, following separate complaints of workplace misconduct.\n\nMr Danker acknowledged he had made some staff feel \"very uncomfortable\" and apologised, but said his name had been wrongly associated with separate claims andthat his reputation had been \"destroyed\".\n\nHe is being replaced by Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI's former chief economist, who is returning to the lobby group after a brief stint at Barclays.\n\nDame Carolyn Fairbairn was the director-general of the CBI between 2015 and 2020. The BBC has contacted her for comment.\n\nMr McBride said the CBI had accepted all 35 recommendations made by Fox Williams investigators and added the organisation had 60 days to produce an action plan for its members to vote one.\n\nThe CBI's president said the organisation had to \"go for a much more zero-tolerance culture\" and get \"much more severe in dealing\" with incidents of bullying and sexual harassment.\n\n\"For us it's about rebuilding the trust that we obviously lost with the members who left us,\" he said.\n\nBut Andy Wood, chief executive of the brewing company Adnams, which has cancelled its membership of the CBI, said he had not heard anything so far that \"reassures me that I should become a member of the CBI again\".\n\nHe said he was not sure if the group was \"salvageable\".\n\n\"Zero tolerance of bullying and sexual harassment - that has to be a given in a modern organisation,\" Mr Wood said.\n\n\"It just shows really how archaic the CBI was behind the scenes. I applaud them for trying to put their house in order but this does feel [like] a few things being done far too late.\"", "The headlines were terrifying. Hospitals facing intolerable pressures with patients left dying in corridors, the BBC reported.\n\nIt got so bad that 68 leading A&E doctors wrote to the prime minister to spell out their concerns.\n\nThis is not now though. It was the winter of 2017-18 - the last bad flu season when more than 300 people a day were dying from that virus at one point.\n\nAnd that was not even a one-off. In January 2016 hospitals were cancelling routine operations, telling patients to stay away from A&E if they could, and emergency treatment areas were being set up outside some units - just as they are now.\n\nThe truth is the past decade has been a story of lengthening waits and declining performance.\n\nA&E waits are the best barometer of this. The proportion of patients waiting less than four hours - a key metric in measuring NHS effectiveness - has been gradually eroded.\n\nIt is a similar story elsewhere in the UK - with performance even worse in Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\nThis should not come as a surprise, as NHS spending has been squeezed.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2019 the annual rises for health were well below those traditionally given since the birth of the NHS, making it difficult to keep up with the needs of the ageing population.\n\nDuring that period, the Tories have been in power - albeit with the Lib Dems for the first five years.\n\nBut it is worth noting, in its 2010 and 2015 election manifestos, Labour was not proposing any tangibly higher increases in spending either.\n\nThe financial crash of 2008 meant all the main political parties were signed up to the idea that spending had to be curtailed.\n\nThis parliament has seen a change - annual rises are now planned to be close to 4% and will end up higher once the pandemic spending is taken into account.\n\nBut the result of the squeeze in the 2010s is fewer doctors and nurses per head of population than our Western European neighbours.\n\nThe turn of the year is always the hardest time. And with the latest data for A&E only covering November, we need to look elsewhere to judge how alarming the current pressures driven by the Omicron variant are.\n\nSince Christmas there have been reports of hospitals declaring critical incidents. At one point on Wednesday evening, one in seven hospital trusts in England were in this situation.\n\nA modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection are required to view this interactive. How is the NHS in your area coping this winter? This trust does not currently supply A&E waiting time figures. When patients arrive at hospital by ambulance they should be handed over within 15 minutes. This data shows the proportion of ambulance patients who waited 30 minutes or more, in the week shown. It comes from daily situation reports which are published weekly during the winter in England. As this is fast-turnaround data, the NHS says only minimal validation can be carried out but it is considered fit for purpose. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland do not publish ambulance queue data. Patients at A&E should be seen within four hours of arrival. This data shows the proportion of patients attending A&E who waited longer than four hours to be treated, discharged or admitted. This data is published monthly for England and Wales and weekly for Scotland. Northern Ireland publishes its data quarterly and Winter 2021 is not yet available. If a patient at A&E needs to be admitted, the wait from decision to admit to being given a bed on a ward is recorded in England. The bed waits figure is the proportion of patients admitted via A&E who waited longer than four hours for a ward bed. In Wales, bed wait data is not published, so the figure shown is the occupancy level in general and acute beds. Scotland and Northern Ireland do not publish bed wait or bed occupancy data. Data for England is show by NHS trust, where the trust includes at least one hospital with a Type 1 A&E department. Type 1 means a consultant-led 24 hour A&E service with full resuscitation facilities. When you enter a postcode for a location in England you will be shown a list of NHS trusts in your area. They will not necessarily be in order of your closest hospital as some trusts have more than one hospital. Data for Wales and Scotland are shown by NHS board. Comparative data from two years ago is shown where available. However, where trusts have merged there is no like-for-like comparison to show. Bed occupancy data in Wales only goes back to April 2020.\n\nIt is, however, very hard to judge exactly what these declarations tell us. They are not normally made public and instead are there to alert local health systems that a service needs help. We have nothing to compare them to.\n\nIf we look at the delays ambulances face when dropping off patients at A&E - this data is available in England up to last weekend - we can see the current difficulties are worse than the last winter before the pandemic hit.\n\nBut it is also fair to say this does not represent the collapse of the NHS, despite all the headlines.\n\nThe truth is the health service will not suddenly become overwhelmed. Instead, what is happening is that care is deteriorating bit by bit.\n\nThe heart attack patients are waiting longer for an ambulance, more elderly patients are spending nights on a trolley in A&E and growing numbers of people are waiting for hip and knee replacements.\n\nThe challenges are, of course, different from winters past. It is a pandemic after all.\n\nA mass vaccination campaign is underway, while the level of staff absence from Covid is bringing another added complexity - it is nearly twice what you would expect - and explains why the army has had to be brought in.\n\nHospitals have also had to completely reconfigure their wards to create Covid and non-Covid areas.\n\nAnd the sheer numbers coming in are a problem. Traditionally winter would see around 1,000 admissions a day for all types of respiratory infections.\n\nCurrently the NHS is seeing more than double that for Covid alone - although a chunk admittedly are people who are ill with something else, such as broken arms, strokes and cancer for example, and may well have come in anyway.\n\nBut even if you discount these patients, you are still well above the 1,000 threshold.\n\nHowever, the NHS has been helped by lower pressures elsewhere. Flu is at rock-bottom levels. There are fewer than 50 patients in hospital with the virus in England.\n\nSo what can we conclude? The challenges are certainly worse and that is translating into poorer quality services.\n\nBut this is not the first year care has been compromised. What matters now is when Covid infections peak - that will determine just how bad this winter will be.\n\nHas your NHS treatment been delayed?

We then can discuss the best treatment options for them and provide a choice of treatment.\"\n\nWhile GPs receive some menopause training, many have told BBC News NI it was not enough and they had to refer to the British Menopause Society's tool kit, which was not ideal.\n\nIn February, a consultant addressed the issue of hysterectomies on social media.\n\nDr Siobhan Kirk, associate specialist in gynaecology and menopause posted on Twitter for \"gynaecology colleagues to \"please stop removing young women's ovaries without adequate pre-op discussion on the consequences/symptoms of #menopause and a clear plan for ~HRT including those having risk reducing surgery.\"\n\nDr Kirk works at the Belfast Health Trust and is a specialist at the menopause clinic based at the Mater Hospital in the north of the city.\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

It, and similar AI products, are expected to dramatically change the way people get information they are searching for online.\n\nTech rivals are racing to offer their own versions of the technology, even as it generates fierce debate, including over the data it uses, the accuracy of the responses and whether the company violated authors' rights as it was training the technology.\n\nThe FTC's letter asks what steps OpenAI has taken to address its products' potential to \"generate statements about real individuals that are false, misleading, disparaging or harmful\".\n\nThe FTC is also looking at OpenAI's approach to data privacy and how it obtains data to train and inform the AI.\n\nMr Altman said OpenAI had spent years on safety research and months making ChatGPT \"safer and more aligned before releasing it\".\n\n\"We protect user privacy and design our systems to learn about the world, not private individuals,\" he said on Twitter.\n\nIn another tweet he said that it was important to the firm that its \"technology is safe and pro-consumer, and we are confident we follow the law. Of course we will work with the FTC.\"\n\nMr Altman appeared before a hearing at Congress earlier this year, in which he admitted that the technology could be a source of errors.\n\nHe called for regulations to be created for the emerging industry and recommended that a new agency be formed to oversee AI safety. He added that he expected the technology to have a significant impact, including on jobs, as its uses become clear.\n\n\"I think if this technology goes wrong, it can go quite wrong... we want to be vocal about that,\" Mr Altman said at the time. \"We want to work with the government to prevent that from happening.\"\n\nThe investigation by the FTC was first reported by the Washington Post, which published a copy of the letter. OpenAI did not respond to a BBC request for comment.\n\nThe FTC also declined to comment. The consumer watchdog has taken a high profile role policing the tech giants under its current chair, Lina Khan.\n\nMs Khan rose to prominence as a Yale law student, when she criticised America's record on anti-monopoly enforcement related to Amazon.\n\nAppointed by President Joe Biden, she is a controversial figure, with critics arguing that she is pushing the FTC beyond the boundaries of its authority.\n\nSome of her most high-profile challenges of tech firms activities - including a push to block the merger of Microsoft with gaming giant Activision Blizzard - have faced setbacks in the courts.\n\nDuring a five-hour hearing in Congress on Thursday, she faced tough criticism from Republicans over her leadership of the agency.\n\nShe did not mention the FTC's investigation into OpenAI, which is at a preliminary stage. But she said she had concerns about the product's output.\n\n\"We've heard about reports where people's sensitive information is showing up in response to an inquiry from somebody else,\" Ms Khan said.\n\n\"We've heard about libel, defamatory statements, flatly untrue things that are emerging. That's the type of fraud and deception that we are concerned about,\" she added.\n\nThe FTC probe is not the company's first challenge over such issues. Italy banned ChatGPT in April, citing privacy concerns. The service was restored after it added a tool to verify users' ages and provided more information about its privacy policy.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: How Trump's indictment in Miami court unfolded - in 60 seconds\n\nDonald Trump has pleaded not guilty to historic charges of mishandling sensitive files at a federal court in Miami, Florida.\n\nMr Trump is the first US president - current or former - to be hit with a federal criminal indictment.\n\nArms crossed, in a dark suit and red tie, he sat in stone-faced silence for his second court appearance this year.\n\nThe Republican later travelled to his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, where he addressed supporters.\n\nAgainst a backdrop of American flags, Mr Trump, who is the frontrunner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, struck a defiant tone and told the assembled crowd he had \"every right\" to hold the classified documents, but \"hadn't had a chance to go through all the boxes\".\n\nHe said he followed the law and went on to list series of unsubstantiated claims as well as grievances against President Joe Biden and his former rival Hillary Clinton.\n\nEarlier in the day before leaving Miami, Mr Trump, on his social media platform Truth Social, thanked the city for \"such a warm welcome on such a sad day for our country\".\n\nJust hours before, in a 13th-floor room of a federal courthouse in downtown Miami, a sombre, subdued Mr Trump looked on while his lawyer entered a plea of not guilty on 37 counts of illegally retaining classified documents and obstructing the government's efforts to get them back.\n\n\"We most certainly enter a plea of not guilty,\" the attorney, Todd Blanche, told the judge.\n\nMr Trump's co-defendant, Walt Nauta - a close aide charged with six criminal counts in the case - was sitting at the same table as the former president.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: The view from inside the Trump courtroom\n\nOn the opposite side of the room sat the entire prosecution team, including special counsel Jack Smith, who announced the indictment last week.\n\nThe former president, who turned 77 on Wednesday, was allowed to leave court without any restrictions to domestic or international travel. Prosecutors told Magistrate Judge Jonathan Goodman the defendant was not considered a flight risk.\n\nBut Mr Trump will not be allowed to discuss the case with Mr Nauta.\n\nAfter the hearing, the Republican flashed supporters a thumbs-up as his motorcade left the courthouse. As they drove away, an anti-Trump protester dressed in a prison jumpsuit ran into the street in front of the motorcade before he was pushed away by security - perhaps the most unruly moment of a largely peaceful day.\n\nMr Trump and his security detail travelled directly to Versailles, a popular Cuban restaurant in Miami's Little Havana, where he was greeted by a throng of supporters who lined up for photos with the former president.\n\nHe appeared to take part in a prayer with some patrons, and was treated to a chorus of Happy Birthday to You.\n\nAlina Habba, a lawyer attorney for the former president, repeated the former president's claims that the charges were politically motivated as she addressed media outside court.\n\n\"We are at a turning point in our nation's history, the targeting prosecution of a leading political opponent is the type of thing you see in dictatorships like Cuba and Venezuela,\" she told reporters.\n\n\"What is being done to the President Trump should terrify all citizens of this country,\" she added.\n\nBefore the hearing, court officials said Mr Trump would not have a mugshot taken but would be digitally fingerprinted and asked to submit a DNA sample by swab.\n\nA trial date has not yet been set, though the case is still earmarked for Aileen Cannon, a federal district judge in South Florida who was appointed by Mr Trump.\n\nThe charges, which were made public on Friday, came after FBI agents found more than 100 documents with classified markings at Mr Trump's private Florida estate Mar-a-Lago in August.\n\nThey allegedly contained information about the defence and weapons capabilities of both the US and foreign countries, as well as plans for possible retaliation in response to a foreign attack.\n\nProsecutors accuse him of hoarding the files, storing some in a ballroom and a bathroom, and of engaging in a conspiracy with an aide to obstruct the FBI's inquiry.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Trump supporters outside court: 'They're afraid of him'\n\nMr Trump's legal troubles appear not to have diminished his support among Republican voters.\n\nA poll by the BBC's US partner CBS found 76% of likely Republican primary voters were more concerned about the indictment being politically motivated than about the documents posing a national security risk.\n\nProtocol dictates that the Department of Justice, the federal agency that enforces US law, should operate independently from the White House. Mr Biden, who is subject to a separate probe into his own handling of classified files, said last week: \"I have never once - not one single time - suggested to the justice department what they should do.\"\n\nLegal experts say the criminal charges could lead to substantial prison time if Mr Trump is convicted. He has vowed, however, to continue his campaign for president whatever the verdict.\n\nMr Trump's court appearance is his second in less than three months. He was arraigned in April in New York on charges that he falsified business records for a hush-money payment to a porn star ahead of the 2016 election.", "Last updated on .From the section Boxing\n\nBoxer Tommy Fury will face YouTuber KSI in a bout at Manchester's AO Arena on 14 October.\n\nUnlike that bout, the match-up with KSI, 30, will not be sanctioned by the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC) as a professional fight.\n\nKSI, real name Olajide Olatunji, has previously fought in a variety of exhibition bouts, twice taking on Paul's brother Logan.\n\nLogan Paul will fight as part of the double main event on October's card against a yet-to-be-named opponent.\n\nFormer Love Island star Fury, the brother of WBC heavyweight champion Tyson Fury, called the fight \"easy money\" adding: \"All that is left for me to do is send this man to sleep. I'll do that inside four rounds.\"\n\nHowever, KSI promised to \"silence all the doubters that believe I have no chance\" in what he says is \"the toughest fight in the influencer boxing scene\".\n\nFury is unbeaten in nine professional fights, winning four by knockout.\n\nHe was expected to beat Jake Paul easily in February, but that fight went the distance and ended in a split decision in his favour.\n\nKSI found fame with The Sidemen and is regularly involved in sketches on their YouTube channel, which has more than 18 million subscribers.\n\nIn April, he was forced to apologise for a racial slur in a YouTube video, an incident which led him to take a break from social media.\n\nOctober's card, which will be live on DAZN, is organised by Misfits Events who are sanctioned not by the BBBofC, but instead by a body called the Professional Boxing Association (PBA).\n\nThe PBA is not the recognised sanctioning body in the UK, and KSI does not hold a professional licence in the country, so the Fury bout does not count towards professional records.", "David and Sara Watson with their late son Adam, who died in August 2022 after almost three years of illness\n\nFinancial support for families with a child in hospital would help them cope with cost such as transport and food, two parents have said.\n\nThe Northern Ireland Children's Health Coalition has called for a a \u00a34m fund to give families a grant of \u00a3500 a year.\n\nDavid and Sara Watson said that money would have made a difference to them.\n\nTheir son Adam was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia in October 2019 when he was seven.\n\nHis parents were living on one wage for many months with a sick child and many parents in similar situations also face costs such as food, drink, fuel, parking, overnight accommodation and childcare.\n\n\"You are starting to count pennies and say: 'We need that amount of money for diesel to get us up and down to hospital for five days this week and we have that for food,'\" said Mr Watson.\n\n\"Money does not come into it when you have a sick child but you still need money to survive.\n\n\"You need money to keep that child as comfortable as possible.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

You are trying to get your child better, keep a roof over your head, trying to live and trying to work and it just builds up.\"\n\nDavid Watson pictured with his son Adam in hospital while the child was being treated for leukaemia\n\nMrs Watson said Adam was aware of the cost-of-living crisis and was watching the news when it talked about people having to make a choice between feeding their family or heating their homes.\n\nShe said he asked her: \"Mummy, do we have money to do both? Do we have money to do both because you and daddy cannot work at the minute because I'm sick?\n\n\"The money thing is one side of it but it is the mental impact that has on us and a child.\n\n\"To hear your son, whilst he is lying there fighting for his life, worrying about his mummy and daddy being able to pay the bills and heating the house.\"\n\nProf Victoria Simms, an academic from Ulster University who carried out a study on the issue, said she found the data \"quite shocking\".\n\n\"There is a disproportionate effect on family income and that is not good for the parents themselves, for their own self-esteem for example, but also for the environment in which those children are going to grow up,\" she said.\n\nThe professor added that there was a \"lack of awareness around the welfare state that they can access and have a right to access\".\n\nInstead, she said, the research found families were \"going to their own parents to ask for income support because they do not want to necessarily access the welfare system\".\n\n\"It just really hits home that these families are doing their best to support their little children and older children that are experiencing long term issues and we really need to support those families the best that we can,\" said Prof Simms.\n\nProf Victoria Simms said parents with children in hospital often rely on financial support from their families\n\nThe Northern Ireland Children's Health Coalition is calling for direct financial support for families who live in Northern Ireland and also cover hospitalisations across the UK and Ireland.\n\nIts co-chairwoman Alison McNulty said that money would help reduce the anxiety families have to bear because of the physical, mental, and practical impact of having a child in hospital.\n\n\"We are putting our parents in very difficult financial situations because they have a very ill child and those children could be in hospital for weeks, months or often a number of times over a given year,\" she said.\n\n\"It will help them with petrol, staying overnight when they have a very sick child, feeding themselves when their child is in hospital and it will go a long way to alleviate some of that stress and anxiety that many of our parents are under.\"\n\nMs McNulty said implementing such a fund would be easy as there was already a mechanism in place for rolling it out - it just needs the Northern Ireland Executive to vote for funding to be put into place.\n\n\"I understand that there are pressures on government at the moment but we cannot let a group of our citizens here in Northern Ireland go without support, to fall between the cracks, because they and their children are suffering when such a fund could make a huge difference,\" she said.\n\nAdam Watson's parents said he was worried about their lack of income while he was in hospital\n\n\"No family should ever fall into debt because they have a sick child,\" said Mr Watson.\n\n\"It is a stress you do not need.\n\n\"You are not looking to make money because your child is sick, you are just looking to survive,\" he said.", "The nurse, originally from Hereford, denies all of the charges\n\nThe jury in the trial of nurse Lucy Letby have been told to approach their deliberations in a \"fair, calm, objective and analytical way\".\n\nJudge Mr Justice James Goss told them it would be \"instinctive for anyone to react with horror\" to any allegation of killing or harming a child.\n\nMs Letby, 33, denies murdering seven children and attempting to kill 10 others at Countess of Chester Hospital.\n\nHer trial, which has been sitting since October, is drawing to a close.\n\nMr Justice Goss earlier gave his first set of legal directions to the jury, who will retire to consider their verdicts in the coming weeks.\n\nThe neonatal nurse, originally from Hereford, is accused of carrying out the attacks throughout 2015 and 2016.\n\nThe jury has heard more than eight months of evidence, including claims she deliberately injected some children with air or poisoned them with insulin.\n\nMs Letby has insisted she did not harm any of the babies, pointed to issues of poor hygiene in the hospital and accused senior doctors of mounting a conspiracy against her.\n\nMr Justice Goss told the jury of eight women and four men that they were \"the judges of the facts\" and any decisions should be based on \"evidence and not speculation\".\n\n\"It is instinctive for anyone to react with horror to any allegation of deliberately harming - let alone killing - a child, the more so a vulnerable, premature baby,\" he said.\n\nMs Letby gave evidence in her own defence during the trial\n\n\"You will naturally feel sympathy for all the parents in this case, particularly those who have lost a child and the harrowing circumstances of their deaths.\n\n\"You must, however, judge the case on all the evidence in a fair, calm, objective and analytical way.\"\n\nMr Justice Goss said it was the prosecution's case that Ms Letby deliberately harmed the babies, intending to kill them.\n\n\"Some of the babies, they allege, were subjected to repeated attempts to kill them,\" he said.\n\nThis was a case in which the prosecution \"substantially, but not wholly\" relied on circumstantial evidence, he told the jury.\n\n\"The defendant was the only member of nursing and clinical staff who was on duty each time that the collapses of all the babies occurred and had associations with them at material times, either being the designated nurse or working on the unit,\" he said.\n\nThe attackes are alleged to have been carried out at Countess of Chester hospital\n\nOutlining the defence's case, Mr Justice Goss said it was their view that there were \"possible causes for many of the collapses other than an intentional harmful act\" and the prosecution's expert evidence \"could not be relied on\".\n\nHe added: \"It is for the prosecution to prove the defendant's guilt of any offence by making you sure of her guilt.\n\n\"She has no burden of proving her innocence.\n\n\"If you are not sure she is guilty of any offence, your verdict should be not guilty.\n\n\"If you are sure of her guilt, your verdict should be guilty.\"\n\nBoth the defence and prosecution are expected to give their closing statements next week.\n\nThe judge will then sum up the evidence in the case before the jury are sent out to begin their deliberations.\n\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

An online support service will launch in June to provide support to those waiting to be seen.\n\nThe new hubs are being formed with partnerships managed by London's Great Ormond Street Hospital and Alder Hey Children's Hospital, in Liverpool.\n\nRobbie de Santos of LGBTQ+ charity Stonewall said it was \"pleased with the continuity of care\" for existing patients \"ensuring their needs are met until new services are ready\" and also welcomed the regional hubs.\n\n\"However, we remain concerned about waiting times and urge NHS England to continue to communicate plans and provide further support for those on the waiting list,\" he said.\n\nTransgender Trend, a UK campaign group that questions the increase in diagnoses of transgender children, said it was also concerned about the number of children on the waiting list as they may have co-existing mental health needs.\n\n\"We would like to see some temporary provision put in for children on the wait list to see a mental health professional,\" it said.\n\n\"CAMHS [Child and Adult Mental Health Services] therapists are already adequately trained to deal with such co-existing issues affecting children with gender-related distress.\"\n\nThe Tavistock clinic was rated as \"inadequate\" by inspectors who visited in late 2020 after the BBC's Newsnight programme reported whistleblowers' concerns.\n\nThe subsequent review called for more \"holistic\" care, looking at patients' overall needs.\n\nThere has been a large increase in referrals to the clinic in recent years and it has struggled to meet demand.\n\nMany of those referred were recorded as female at birth but developed gender distress in their early teens.\n\nIn July last year, NHS England announced Gids would close in spring 2023, following the interim report by Dr Hilary Cass which called the current single service \"unsustainable\".

Hopefully we will.\"\n\nThe launch has had a warm response online, with one person telling the BBC they saw Threads as a \"much-needed competitor\" to Twitter.\n\nCompetitors have criticised the amount of data the app might use. This may include health, financial, and browsing data linked to users' identities, according to the Apple App Store.\n\nSome users have also expressed concern that it is not possible to delete your Threads profile without deleting the associated Instagram profile. Meta told the BBC: \"At this time, you can't delete your Threads profile without deleting your Instagram account. This is something we're working on. In the meantime, you can deactivate your Threads profile at any time.\n\n\"Deactivating your Threads profile will not deactivate your Instagram account\".\n\nDeactivation will mean your Threads profile, your posts and interactions with others' posts won't be visible, the firm added.\n\nUsers can download and delete Threads data by visiting their Instagram settings, Meta says.\n\nThreads is now available to download in over 100 countries including the UK, but not yet in the EU because of regulatory concerns.\n\nHave you signed up for Threads and what do you think of the app?

You can also get in touch in the following ways:\n\nMeta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, called the new app an \"initial version\", with extra features planned including the ability to interact with people on other social media apps like Mastodon.\n\n\"Our vision with Threads is to take what Instagram does best and expand that to text,\" the firm said prior to its launch.\n\nDespite Threads being a standalone app, users log in using an Instagram account. Their Instagram username carries over, but there is an option to customize their profile specifically for Threads.\n\nUsers will also be able to choose to follow the same accounts they do on Instagram, Meta says. The app allows users to be private on Instagram, but public on Threads.\n\nThe new app's release comes after criticism of Meta's business practices.\n\nLast year, Meta whistleblower Frances Haugen said the company had put \"profits over safety\" and criticised how the platform was moderated.\n\nThe company was also rocked by a scandal in which it allowed third parties, including British political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, to access Facebook users' personal data.\n\nIn an apparent reference to this controversial past, Mr Musk joked on Monday \"thank goodness they're so sanely run\".\n\nThere are several alternatives to Twitter available, such as Bluesky and Mastodon, but these have struggled to gain traction.\n\nThreads has a significant advantage because it is connected to Instagram, and the hundreds of millions of users already on that platform.\n\nOn Threads, posts can be shared to Instagram and vice versa and can include links, photos, and videos of up to five minutes in length.\n\nHowever, some early users on Wednesday reported problems when uploading images, hinting at teething problems.\n\nUsers see a feed of posts, which Meta calls \"threads\", from people they follow as well as recommended content.\n\nThey are able to control who can \"mention\" them and filter out replies to posts that contain specific words.\n\nUnfollowing, blocking, restricting or reporting other profiles is also possible, and any accounts users block on Instagram are automatically blocked on Threads.\n\nWhile Meta stresses ties to Instagram, media coverage has focused on its similarity to Twitter, with some investors describing the app as a \"Twitter killer\".\n\nPosts can be shared between Threads and Instagram and can include links, photos, and videos\n\nOn Saturday, Twitter boss Elon Musk restricted the number of tweets users could see on his platform per day, citing extreme \"data scraping\".\n\nIt was Mr Musk's latest push to get users to sign up to Twitter Blue, the platform's subscription service.\n\nTwitter has also announced that its popular user dashboard TweetDeck will go behind a paywall in 30 days' time.\n\nSince Mr Musk took over, many users of Twitter have publicly expressed their dissatisfaction with the platform and his stewardship - citing erratic behaviour and political views.\n\nLast month, Mr Musk and Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg agreed - possibly in jest - to a cage fight, and Mr Zuckerberg's early posts on Threads mentioned his interest in mixed martial arts.\n\nWhile Threads will be available in the UK, it is not yet available in the EU because of regulatory uncertainty, particularly around the EU's Digital Markets Act.\n\nBut the company says it is looking into launching in the EU.\n\nThat act lays down rules on how large companies such as Meta can share data between platforms that they own. The sharing of data between Threads and Instagram is part of the issue.\n\nMeta maintains protecting privacy is fundamental to its business.", "Lord Justice Haddon-Cave has stepped down from his role as a judge to lead the inquiry\n\nThe inquiry into allegations of unlawful killings by UK special forces in Afghanistan is critical to \"restoring the reputation of the military and the country\", its chair has said.\n\nThe inquiry will look into night raids carried out by UK special forces between mid-2010 and mid-2013.\n\nIt will examine both allegations of killings and of subsequent cover-ups.\n\nThe inquiry will look specifically at night raids known as Deliberate Detention Operations (DDOs), which were carried out by special-forces units.\n\nIt comes after what the judge described as \"significant reporting\" by the BBC's Panorama programme last year, which revealed that one British SAS squadron may have unlawfully killed at least 54 Afghans during one six-month tour.\n\nThe inquiry also follows legal challenges brought by two families of people killed by British forces in DDOs.\n\nLaunching the inquiry on Wednesday, Lord Justice Haddon-Cave called for anyone with relevant information to come forward.\n\n\"It is clearly important that anyone who has broken the law is referred to the relevant authorities for investigation, and equally, those who have done nothing wrong should rightly have the cloud of suspicion lifted from them,\" he said.\n\nLord Justice Haddon-Cave said many of the inquiry's hearings would have to be held in private because of the \"highly sensitive\" nature of the testimony.\n\nAbdul Aziz Uzbakzai, an Afghan farmer whose son and daughter-in-law were killed by British special forces during a night raid in 2012 and whose grandsons Imran and Bilal were gravely wounded in the operation, told the BBC the inquiry \"cannot bring back my son and daughter-in-law, nor can it bring Imran and Bilal's parents back to them\".\n\n\"But after 11 long years, I still want the British soldiers and other officials to come forward and reveal the truth,\" Mr Uzbakzai said.\n\n\"We are still unaware of why we were targeted, and we long to know why.\"\n\nDo you have information about this story that you want to share?\n\nGet in touch using SecureDrop, a highly anonymous and secure way of whistleblowing to the BBC which uses the TOR network.\n\nOr by using the Signal messaging app, an end-to-end encrypted message service designed to protect your data.\n\nPlease note that the SecureDrop link will only work in a Tor browser.

A spokesperson said it was not appropriate for the MoD to comment further \"on cases which are within the scope of the Statutory Inquiry\", adding that it was \"up to the Statutory Inquiry Team, led by Lord Justice Haddon-Cave, to determine which allegations are investigated\".\n\nLabour's shadow defence secretary, John Healey, said: \"This special inquiry is welcome and must succeed.\"\n\nHe added: \"This cannot be swept under the carpet.\"", "The Metropolitan Police is expected to be heavily criticised for being racist, sexist and homophobic in a report.\n\nBaroness Casey's review will be published on Tuesday.\n\nShe was appointed to review the force's culture and standards after the murder of Sarah Everard by serving officer Wayne Couzens.\n\nThe BBC has not seen a draft of Baroness Casey's report but understands that it will heavily criticise the Met's tolerance of wrongdoing.\n\nThe report is also expected to criticise how the Met protects its own people ahead of the public.\n\nA government source told the BBC the findings of the draft report were \"very serious\" and would make for \"bad reading\".\n\nHome Secretary Suella Braverman has been in talks with the Met Commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, this week about the findings after it is understood the final draft of the report was sent to them.\n\nSir Mark was appointed commissioner in September and even after the critical report is published next week, the Home Office will back his leadership to reform the Met and bring about change, and wants to give him the time to do so.\n\nThe force is already facing a separate independent inquiry into how Couzens and the serial rapist officer David Carrick were able to become policemen and were not identified as threats to women.\n\nThe interim Casey review which was published in October found hundreds of Met officers had been getting away with breaking the law and misconduct.\n\nIt found many claims of sexual misconduct, misogyny, racism and homophobia had been badly mishandled.\n\nSir Mark apologised and admitted there were officers still serving who should have been sacked.\n\nWhile the interim report focused on the failures of the force's internal misconduct system, this final report is expected to be much wider.\n\nIt has examined, and will criticise the culture, recruitment, training and leadership of the force.\n\nOne source told the BBC the final report contained a lot of findings that were extremely bad for the Met.\n\nThe BBC has spoken to two women whose ex-partners are serving Met officers. Both women raised concerns that the force is unable to deal with abusive officers within its ranks.\n\nSally, not her real name, was living with a Met officer who she met when he investigated a crime she had been a victim of. Last year, she told the Met that he had domestically abused her and had misused police powers. He is now going through the Met's misconduct system and is on restricted duties.\n\nShe told the BBC she felt as though the force had not dealt with her complaints.\n\n\"I think it's easier to let these police officers stay than to get rid of them,\" she said. \"He's still working, he's still getting paid, he's still going to get his full pension.\n\n\"I don't trust the police at all and I do not understand why we report allegations against the police to other police officers. There is no place in the police service for an officer like him, absolutely not.\"\n\nA woman the BBC has called Natalie to protect her identity claims her ex-husband, a Met officer, coercively controlled her. She said she struggled to find the right avenues to complain to the force to get them to take action.\n\n\"You're brought up to believe the police are there to protect. The police should be there to protect, that's what we pay taxes for but they just seem to protect themselves.\"\n\n\"I've been in police stations, I've spoken to policewomen who squeezed my arm and looked compassionate, and told me this time it would be sorted.

He's enabled and protected.\"\n\nCdr James Harman from the Met's directorate of professional standards acknowledged that the force needs to do more, saying: \"I recognise that we are in a bad place but we are committed and absolutely determined to turn that around and we are going to do so.\n\n\"I completely understand that people will often feel nervous or hesitant to report a crime committed by the police.\"\n\nThe Met Police said in a statement \"the report will play an important role in informing and shaping our work to deliver 'More Trust, Less Crime and High Standards'.\n\n\"It will be published next week which will be the appropriate point for us to respond in further detail.\"\n\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \"The Home Secretary has been clear that culture and standards in policing must be raised in order to regain the trust and confidence of the public.

A series of meetings have been taking place this year aimed at addressing these issues.\n\nDeveloping nations - which are disproportionately impacted by climate-related impacts - have called for guaranteed compensation from developed countries, who they say are historically responsible for climate change through their high emissions of greenhouse gases.\n\nRicher countries recognise the need to contribute greater funds towards the issue, but framing the payments as reparations is controversial, with some claiming it is a divisive term.\n\nDeveloping countries also argue that finance targets to address the issue of climate change are too low.\n\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.", "The government has announced plans to sanction Iranian officials behind what it called hostile activities in the UK.\n\nThe foreign secretary said since January 2022 there had been 15 credible threats by Iran's regime to kill or kidnap Britons or UK-based people.\n\nUnder existing legislation, the UK can sanction Iranians for human rights violations or nuclear proliferation activities within the Islamic republic.\n\nThe UK will not \"tolerate this malign behaviour\", James Cleverly said.\n\nThe new plans would allow the government to target Iranians responsible for \"hostile activities towards the UK and our partners\u2026 including threats to our people, property or security\".

There were no casualties, and the president was unhurt, it said.\n\nBut the Kremlin did call it \"an assassination attempt\" against Vladimir Putin.\n\nA number of videos then surfaced. They appear to show at least one drone flying towards the Kremlin, followed by an explosion. Another appears to show smoke rising from a Kremlin structure, and a fire. The BBC has been unable to verify that it was a drone and it is unclear what really happened.\n\nBut if what the Kremlin is saying is true, and this was a genuine attempt on the president's life, then it would be a highly embarrassing incident for the Kremlin.\n\nBy all accounts, Mr Putin appears to be one of the most closely-guarded leaders in the world. At his events in Moscow attended by BBC journalists, extremely tight security has been in place, including extensive checks and long convoys of vehicles, with airspace closed and traffic halted.\n\nQuestions will now be asked about how well-protected the Russian leader is - and about the effectiveness of Russian air defences.\n\nIn recent months, anti-aircraft systems have been spotted on Moscow rooftops in the vicinity of key buildings, including the defence ministry. They have been placed there precisely for this reason - because the Kremlin is concerned that Ukraine, or those sympathetic to Ukraine, may attempt to carry out aerial attacks on high-value targets.\n\nIf that's what this incident was, then those measures failed.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThis is the latest in a string of attacks and explosions that have hit Russian territory in recent weeks and months.\n\nThe last few days have seen a spike in such incidents.

But whether the Russian account of what happened is accurate or not, the question now is whether Moscow will respond - and if so, how.\n\nSome Russian officials have already called for tough action. An assassination attempt against the president, if that's what this was, is an extremely serious matter.

Following an inquest into both deaths, their families say they will continue their fight to find out what happened.\n\nOnce a month for the past year and a half, Yvette Sampson and Nicola Foster have met up in a coffee shop in Canterbury, Kent. The first meeting, says Nicola, was \"very tearful. They still are now, sometimes. Because we've both been in the same situation, we understand how the other's feeling.\"\n\nAt first glance, the two women are not natural companions. Their personalities are very different - Yvette, 54, is quiet and softly spoken while Nicola, 56, is louder and more forthright.\n\nBut their inner cores - an ironclad determination sustained by overwhelming grief - matters more than any superficial characteristics. \"We have helped each other. No-one else can understand it unless you've been through it,\" says Nicola.\n\nDespite not meeting until 2021, the two women have known of each other since the summer of 2018, when their daughters died seven weeks apart in extraordinary circumstances.\n\nYvette's daughter Kimberley died in May that year aged 29, three weeks after giving birth to her second child by Caesarean section. Then in early July, 32-year-old Samantha Mulcahy, Nicola's daughter, died 10 days after she gave birth to her first child, also by Caesarean section.\n\nAt the time, health officials insisted the two deaths were not linked. But a BBC investigation in 2021 established apparent links between the two deaths - both had been operated on by the same surgeon.\n\nOn 14 July a coroner concluded that it was \"unlikely\" that the surgeon was \"the source of the infection\", leaving unanswered questions for their families.\n\nBoth Samantha and Kimberley were treated in hospitals run by the East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust. And on 26 July, the coroner ruled both had died following a \"disseminated\" herpes infection before or around the delivery of their babies that caused multi-organ failure.\n\nIt is estimated about 70% of adults have one of two types of the herpes simplex virus by the age of 25, but for the vast majority of people this will only cause occasional, mild symptoms at worst.\n\nDeaths caused by HSV-1 - herpes simplex 1 - are almost unheard of in healthy people.\n\nIn a statement after the inquest into Kimberley and Samantha's deaths, the trust's chief executive Tracey Fletcher offered \"sincere condolences\" to their families, adding that it had made changes since 2018 \"to ensure that if such a rare infection arising from this virus is suspected, it will be treated more quickly\".\n\nIn mid-July 2018, Yvette attended a meeting with senior clinicians at the trust. By this point, she knew of the death of Nicola's daughter, Samantha. Yvette asked whether any of the same healthcare staff had treated Samantha and Yvette's own daughter, Kimberley.\n\n\"I was told, it was something they were still looking into,\" she says. \"And then I said, but if you do find out there is a healthcare [link] you will let us know, won't you? And they said yes.\"\n\nShe now believes the trust was not being honest, however. Though Kimberley had been treated at the Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother Hospital in Margate, and Samantha at the William Harvey Hospital in Ashford, the same surgeon had performed both Caesarean operations, an inquest into both women's deaths heard. And by the time of that meeting, the trust knew this. At the inquest, the trust did not deny that it withheld this information from the families.\n\nMs Fletcher, the trust's chief executive, apologised after the inquest for the \"additional and unnecessary suffering the trust has caused these families through failing to answer their questions after Kimberley and Samantha's deaths and contributing to the delays in their inquests being heard\". She said the trust was changing the way it responds when things go wrong, adding: \"We are truly sorry.\"\n\nYvette says she was \"definitely\" lied to when it told her Samantha and Kimberley had not been treated by the same staff.\n\nDespite the trust failing to acknowledge any link, the two mothers refused to accept the narrative that their daughters' deaths had been unfortunate, unlikely coincidences. \"I couldn't let it go,\" says Yvette, who with her husband Louis is raising Kimberley's two children.\n\nBoth Nicola and Yvette knew of the other family affected but investigated each death alone.\n\nNicola did spend time on Facebook trying to find the Sampsons but couldn't locate them. Yvette isn't on social media, and while similarly keen to speak to Samantha's family, she wanted to \"respect\" the grief they were going through.\n\nAs well as grieving for her daughter, Nicola - who owns a cleaning firm - also had to try to support her son-in-law, now on his own with a new baby.\n\nRyan Mulcahy's life had swung violently from the high of having his first child to losing his wife in a matter of days.\n\nRyan says he felt could not grieve for Samantha because he needed to be there for their daughter\n\nSamantha and Ryan were teenage sweethearts who married in September 2017. It wasn't too long before Samantha found out she was expecting a baby. Though there were complications during the pregnancy, their daughter was born healthy. \"I felt like my world was complete,\" Ryan says.\n\nBut Samantha wasn't recovering as expected, and despite what had happened to Kimberley only a few weeks previously, doctors struggled to identify what was making Samantha ill.\n\n\"She just kept saying, 'It hurts. It hurts,'\" remembers Ryan. \"I told her\u2026 that I loved her and just to keep fighting.\"\n\nBut she died before she could be moved.\n\nIn the aftermath of her death, Ryan felt \"complete numbness\". He says he wanted to grieve but felt he couldn't because he needed to be there for their daughter, as Samantha would have wanted.\n\nRyan says of their child: \"The one thing that terrifies me is that later on, she's going to blame herself.\" He worries she will think \"'this wouldn't have happened to Sam if she wasn't there' - that's what I don't want.\n\n\"I want her to know that it's nothing to do with her.\"\n\nLike Nicola, Ryan has spent the years since desperately trying to find out what happened to Samantha, both for himself and his daughter.\n\nA breakthrough came in the summer of 2021, when Yvette was on holiday in Tenerife. She received an email - a batch of documents she had requested through Freedom of Information requests after being advised to do so by the BBC.\n\nThat is when she found out that the same surgeon, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had operated on both Kimberley and Samantha, and that the trust had been encouraged in the summer of 2018, by an external laboratory, to test the surgeon - to check if he could have infected them, something the trust never did.\n\n\"I was in total shock,\" she said in an emotional witness statement at the inquest. \"I felt betrayed. I even felt foolish that I had let these people [from the trust] into my home. I had trusted and believed in what they told me.\"\n\nFollowing the initial BBC story, Nicola and Yvette met up and have become firm friends since, a bond strengthened when both went through the gruelling inquest process.\n\nThe start of the inquest was delayed for several weeks when, the night before it was due to begin, the trust applied for reporting restrictions to prevent the same surgeon who carried out both procedures being named.\n\nOver nine days, the families had to sit through aggressive questioning as the trust's barrister probed both mothers' enduring belief that their daughters had been infected, unwittingly, by the same surgeon.\n\n\"I know they have a job to do,\" says Nicola. \"But sometimes I think they need to actually stop and think before they speak and maybe think if that was their daughter, and that had happened to them. How would they actually feel?\"\n\nThen on 14 July, after numerous delays, the coroner, Catherine Wood, outlined her conclusions.\n\nYvette Sampson says the loss of her daughter has left her family \"absolutely heartbroken\"\n\nMs Wood found that \"on the balance of probabilities, it was unlikely that the obstetrician in common was the common source of the infection\", in part as the trust had never tested the surgeon back in 2018. Ms Wood was unable to come to a conclusion as to how the virus had been caught by the two women.\n\nIn Kimberley's case, the coroner found that doctors should have considered that she may have been suffering from a viral infection 48 hours earlier than they did - and that if they had, and treated her accordingly, she may have survived.\n\nMs Wood found that in Samantha's case, her symptoms were not so straightforward to spot, so \"there was no clinical indications to commence\" anti-viral drugs before it was likely already too late to make a difference.\n\nAs the rain started to pour outside Maidstone Town Hall, where the inquest was heard, both Nicola and Yvette reflected on the loss their families have suffered. Despite the coroner's conclusion, both remain convinced the surgeon did infect their daughters.\n\n\"Losing Sam has left a massive void in our lives and a little girl without her mummy,\" says Nicola.\n\n\"The last five years have felt like a real fight for answers.

Under usual parliamentary procedure, the House of Lords can require MPs to reconsider bills but cannot force the government to accept changes.\n\nBut it raises the prospect of another clash between ministers and Tory backbenchers over contested aspects of the legislation.\n\nThe bill, backed by MPs in March, is central to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's high-profile pledge to \"stop\" small boats crossing the English Channel.\n\nIt would place a legal duty on the government to detain and remove those arriving in the UK illegally, either to Rwanda or another \"safe\" third country.\n\nThe government says it is committed to its plan to remove migrants to Rwanda, despite the Court of Appeal ruling it was unlawful. It has already said it will appeal the decision at the Supreme Court.\n\nThere has been concern about how children will be treated under the new migration bill, as well as accusations that existing UK regulations to prevent modern slavery would be undermined.\n\nAlthough the legal duty to deport migrants would not apply to under-18s the bill would give ministers new powers to deport them in certain circumstances detain them for extended periods.\n\nIt would also extend the limit on how long children could be detained before apply for bail from three days to eight. A previous version of the bill proposed allowing children to be detained without the ability to apply for bail for up to 28 days.\n\nThe government argues detention powers are necessary to ensure migrants destined for removal do not \"disappear into the community\" - and says no one would be held longer than is \"absolutely necessary\" to ensure they are deported.\n\nIt adds that there is also an over-arching legal duty to ensure the length of detention is \"reasonable\", adding that leaving the UK voluntarily will \"always be an option for all\".\n\nAhead of the vote in the House of Commons on Tuesday, the Home Office offered to reintroduce a 72-hour time limit on the detention of pregnant women.\n\nAmendments passed by the House of Lords would also mean a 72-hour time limit on the detention of unaccompanied children. Detention of accompanied children will be limited to 96 hours under proposals approved by peers - which could be extended to a maximum of seven days if approved by a minister.\n\nThe government had previously watered down its child detention plans in the face of a rebellion by backbench Conservative MPs.\n\nIn other votes on Wednesday, the Lords voted to reinsert a ban on deportations of LGBT migrants to 10 mainly African countries, including Rwanda, Nigeria and Kenya - with a specific ban on trans men and women being deported to Brazil. The same proposals had previously been approved by peers in July.\n\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nSuella Braverman says she is \"confident nothing untoward happened\", but has refused to be drawn over whether she asked civil servants to arrange a one-to-one speed awareness course for her.\n\nThe home secretary was caught speeding in 2022 and, according to reports, asked the civil service for advice on arranging a private course.\n\nThe PM is under pressure to investigate whether she broke the ministerial code.\n\nRishi Sunak has asked his ethics adviser about the case.\n\nHe has also spoken to the home secretary, and Downing Street said he still had confidence in the home secretary.\n\nMrs Braverman is under scrutiny not over the speeding offence itself, but over whether she acted properly in relation to the civil service, by asking officials to assist with a private matter, over a one-to-one speed awareness course.\n\nAfter being caught speeding, Ms Braverman faced getting three points on her licence and a fine, or a course as part of a group.\n\nA government source told the BBC the senior minister had been \"concerned\" about her insurance premiums, and favoured doing a course. She is reported to have asked civil servants about a one-on-one course, citing security concerns about doing one as part of a group. She was told it was not a matter for the civil service.\n\nShe then asked a special adviser to try to arrange a private course.\n\nWhen the speed course provider said there was no option to do this, Mrs Braverman opted to pay the fine and accept the points, because she was \"very busy\" a source told the BBC. By this point she had been reappointed as home secretary in Mr Sunak's government.\n\nThe same government source refused to say whether Mrs Braverman's motivation to do the course in private was to reduce the chances of her being recognised by members of the public.\n\nSpeeding awareness course providers are contracted by individual police forces. According to UK Road Offender Education, the not-for-profit organisation responsible, these contracts make \"no provision for private one-to-one courses\" at the request of the driver.\n\nThe ministerial code requires ministers to ensure \"no conflict arises\" between their public duties and their private interests.\n\nRepeatedly asked in an interview whether she instructed officials to arrange a one-on-one speeding course, Mrs Braverman said: \"Last summer, I was speeding, I regret that, I paid the fine and I took the points.\"\n\nAsked whether she would welcome an investigation into what happened or if she had spoken to the prime minister about it, Ms Braverman said: \"I am focussed on working as the home secretary.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Ministers must ensure that no conflict arises or appears to arise between their public duties and their private interests.\n\n\"Even asking a question of a civil servant as to how she might go on one of these courses puts them in an impossible position.\"\n\nThe ministerial code sets standards of conduct expected of ministers, including that they must uphold the political impartiality of the civil service.\n\nFormer business secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg told Radio 4's World at One, he was confident Ms Braverman had not broken any rules.\n\n\"What goes on in private offices is a minister is busy and has many things to do and sometimes will ask for something the civil servants can't do,\" he said.\n\n\"As soon as once they say no, and you accept it, you haven't done anything wrong.\"\n\nIn the Commons, Mr Sunak told MPs he has \"asked for further information\" and will update MPs \"on the appropriate course of action in due course\".\n\nThe prime minister's official spokesman said Mr Sunak \"wants to avail himself of all the information before he makes a decision\". The prime minister still has confidence in the home secretary, the spokesman added.\n\nMrs Braverman was in Downing Street on Monday lunchtime, and afterwards headed to the House of Commons for a scheduled question session from MPs on Home Office issues.\n\nDuring the session, Mrs Braverman was repeatedly pressed on whether she had asked civil servants to arrange a private speed awareness course.\n\nLabour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: \"If the home secretary can't grip on her own rule-breaking behaviour how can she get a grip on anything else.\"\n\nThe home secretary told MPs she had paid the speeding fine and had not sought to avoid any sanction.\n\nLabour Leader Sir Keir Starmer said the prime minister should order his adviser, Sir Laurie Magnus, to investigate whether ministerial rules were broken.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Breakfast, Sir Keir said it looked like \"inappropriate action took place\" from the home secretary that \"needs to be fully investigated\".\n\n\"The usual consequence of breaking the ministerial code is that you'll go,\" he added.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats are also calling for an investigation and said Mr Sunak needed to make a statement in Parliament about the claims.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. \"Did you have any questions about the summit?\" Rishi Sunak asks the BBC's Chris Mason\n\nAnswering questions at the G7 summit over the weekend, Mr Sunak apparently did not know anything about the story the until it was first reported in the Sunday Times. and he declined to say whether he would be ordering an investigation.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference, he also declined to say he backed Mrs Braverman - but a Downing Street source later said that \"of course\" he did.\n\nAfter serving as attorney general between February 2020 and September 2022, Mrs Braverman was promoted to home secretary under Liz Truss.\n\nShe resigned on 19 October after sending an official document from a personal email to a backbench MP - describing it as a \"technical infringement of the rules\".

This will raise the profile of the case and allow the government to allocate more resources to securing his release.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken \"made a determination that Evan Gershkovich is wrongfully detained by Russia\", state department spokesman Vedant Patel said.\n\nHe called for the \"immediate release\" of Mr Gershkovich and condemned \"the Kremlin's continued repression of independent voices in Russia, and its ongoing war against the truth.\"\n\nThe WSJ said: \"The distinction will unlock additional resources and attention at the highest levels of the US government in securing his release.\"\n\n\"We are doing everything in our power to support Evan and his family,\" it added.\n\nRussia has not granted US consular officials access to Mr Gershkovich, which is in violation of international law, Mr Patel told reporters earlier on Monday.\n\nLast week the Russian foreign ministry said the issue of consular access was being resolved but added that the \"fuss in the US about this case, which was aimed at pressurising the Russian authorities... was hopeless and senseless\".\n\nMr Gershkovich, 31, is well known among foreign correspondents in Moscow.

He also spent 12 years working as an adviser for the White House.\n\nSo when the Ministry of Defence was putting together the guest list for the 25th annual Chemical Weapons Demilitarisation Conference - which in its own words would \"bring together international experts and promoting collaboration to achieve a future free from chemical weapons\" - Mr Kaszeta's services as a keynote speaker were secured back in January.\n\nThe American, who has been based in the UK for the past 13 years, told BBC Two's Newsnight he was \"outraged\" that the government's trawl through his Twitter account - on which he poked fun at Liz Truss, expressed anti-Brexit views and criticised asylum policy - means he can no longer share his knowledge with delegates from the government, industry, academia and armed forces.\n\nHe received an email last month - which has been shown to Newsnight - that told him: \"Rules introduced by the Cabinet Office in 2022 specify that the social media accounts of potential speakers must be vetted before final acceptance to the programme. The vetting is impartial and purely evidence-based.\n\n\"The check on your social media has identified material that criticises government officials and policy. It is for this reason and not because we do not value your technical insight, that I'm afraid that we have no choice and must cancel your invitation to the CWD conference.\"\n\nMr Kaszeta stressed he was never going to speak about policy matters at the event.\n\n\"This is an outrage against free speech. I was going to speak about possible future scenarios around the world in which chemical demilitarisation would be relevant. I think perhaps the most controversial thing I would say was perhaps, gee, we don't really know what's going on in North Korea,\" he said.\n\nThe email is the clearest indication so far of the unpublished guidance from the Cabinet Office on the restrictions on who can be given a prominent platform to speak at government venues and events.\n\nIt was first introduced after political blogger Guido Fawkes highlighted the views of an academic who was due to speak to civil servants at the Home Office during Black History Month in 2021.\n\nA year later, the first known example of the new \"no-platform\" rule being used came when Kate Devlin, a professor at King's College London, an expert on artificial intelligence, was disinvited from speaking at an event about women in tech.\n\nShe told the Independent at the time that she had received an email saying it was because she had \"made a criticism of government policy on social media\".\n\nIn her case, she had previously criticised the government's planned Online Harms Bill, made anti-monarchy comments and retweeted a parody of Liz Truss.\n\nInterviewed at the time, she told Newsnight she had been very clear that her talk would not be touching on any areas she had her own private views on and she found it \"quite alarming\" that she had still been excluded.\n\nMr Kaszeta argued that being a critic of some government policies should not prevent him taking part in an event on a completely unrelated subject.\n\n\"I'm a critic of the government's policy on homelessness and asylum seekers. Why that should have any impact whatsoever on whether or not I can speak to a technical conference in my own area of expertise. That's Stalinist.\"\n\nWhen approached by Newsnight for an explanation, the government said: \"As the public would expect, we conduct due diligence checks and carefully consider all speakers at any government hosted conference to ensure that we can have a balanced and constructive discussion around our policies.\"\n\nOther than Ms Devlin and Mr Kaszeta, whose identity was first revealed by the Times, Newsnight knows of three other professionals who have received similar letters after the Cabinet Office vetted their social media.", "South East Water said demand for drinking water in Kent and Sussex has reached record levels in June\n\nA hosepipe and sprinkler ban has been imposed on people in Kent and Sussex.\n\nSouth East Water said it had no choice after demand for drinking water had reached \"record levels\" in June, similar to last year's drought.\n\nUp to 4,000 customers are without water or have been experiencing low pressure since Monday due to supply issues.\n\nThe water company had urged people to only use water for essential purposes, but has now issued an immediate ban on hosepipes and sprinklers.\n\nThe measures mean that using the equipment to water gardens, clean cars and fill swimming pools will not be allowed.\n\nIt is understood that the Temporary Usage Ban can only be enforced after ten days of consultation, meaning after 26 June rule-breakers could be hit with a \u00a31,000 fine.\n\nAreas including Wadhurst, Mayfield, Biddenden and Staplehurst have been affected by water outages.\n\nBottle stations have been set up across the two counties, and the supply issues are expected to continue until Sunday.\n\nDouglas Whitfield, South East Water's director of operations, told BBC Radio Kent the hot weather had caused demand to outstrip supply.\n\n\"We are pumping as much water as we can into the system, but water is being used before it gets to those customers who are currently on the end of our system,\" he said.\n\nBottled water stations had been opened in Mayfield, Rotherfield, Wadhurst and Ashford\n\nSouth East Water said its facilities are working at full output, with every water treatment work and water source available producing treated water to keep up with demand.\n\nDespite this, the company said it was unable to return drinking water storage tanks to \"satisfactory levels\".\n\nIf your water is supplied by South East Water and you live in Kent or Sussex, you cannot use a hosepipe to:\n\nThere are exemptions, which can be found on South East Water's website.\n\nThe firm said the demand for water had broken all previous records, including during the Covid lockdown heatwave periods.\n\nIt said it had produced an additional 120 million litres of water a day - equivalent to supplying four towns the size of Maidstone or Eastbourne.\n\nThe company serves 2.3 million people across Hampshire, Berkshire, Surrey, Sussex and Kent.\n\nCustomers took to Twitter to express their anger over the hosepipe ban, with some blaming the high usage on leaks.\n\nOne said: \"That will be the MANY water MAIN pipes that have burst recently!!

Over the two games I felt that we deserved to go through. It was a special night.\"\n\nIs this lift-off for Potter?\n\nPotter was been waiting for a show of strength such as this from the moment he left Brighton to take over at Chelsea, succeeding Champions League winner Thomas Tuchel.\n\nPotter has struggled to convince Chelsea's fans he has the personality required to take on this occasionally dysfunctional football beast and his cause has not been helped by poor Premier League form and a battle to establish any sort of shape and stability from the influx of players assembled at vast expense by new owner Todd Boehly.\n\nThe pressure was released somewhat with Saturday's narrow win over Leeds United at Stamford Bridge but a big Champions League win against opponents of such European pedigree as Borussia Dortmund will go some way to convincing the doubters that Potter is cut out for the task.\n\nThere is still much work to do as Chelsea lie in a wholly unacceptable 10th place in the Premier League and two victories will not change the landscape instantly but there is no doubt Stamford Bridge felt like a much happier place when Dutch referee Danny Makkelie sounded his final whistle.\n\nPotter will have been satisfied to see big performances from fit-again Reece James with Ben Chilwell also outstanding. And his former Brighton player Marc Cucurella also looked much more at home than he has before.\n\nThe scenes at the final whistle were a sharp contrast to many witnessed at Stamford Bridge this season with Potter punching the air in front of joyous Chelsea supporters as their Champions League journey continues.\n\nPotter added: \"To win a game and go into the last eight of the Champions League, it's up there with one of the games or evenings of my career.\n\n\"I watched the first penalty and it didn't work so well. I can't do anything. It's down to Kai and his talent and testament and that's at the top level.\"\n\nAll eyes were England teenager Jude Bellingham from the moment he arrived at Stamford Bridge, with waiting Chelsea fans making an instant sales pitch for the young star, who is expected to be pursued by every big club in Europe this summer.\n\nThis was not Bellingham's best night as Dortmund's Champions League campaign came to an end with the added disappointment of squandering a first-leg lead, but the 19-year-old still showed why he will be in such demand.\n\nBellingham's night had low points, such as when he poked a great chance wide from eight yards in the second half and a very poor challenge in the closing seconds that left Reece James prostrate and brought a yellow card.\n\nHe did, however, show class and arrogance on the ball, vision, and a marauding style as Dortmund chased an equaliser in vain after Chelsea grabbed control.\n\nBellingham trooped off at the final whistle and is likely to be playing his Champions League football elsewhere next season, but in little flashes he still showed what all the fuss is about.\n\u2022 None Jude Bellingham (Borussia Dortmund) is shown the yellow card for a bad foul.\n\u2022 None Attempt saved.

He explained away his infamous Access Hollywood tape boasts about grabbing women by their genitals as reflecting a historical truth about the power of celebrities - \"unfortunately or fortunately\".\n\nHe said that both Ms Carroll and another woman who testified that Mr Trump sexually assaulted her were not his type - a description he also applied, voluntarily, to the female attorney conducting the deposition itself.\n\nFor a jury weighing whether Mr Trump was the kind of person capable of sexual assault - or, at least, whether he was more credible than his accuser - it was exactly the wrong attitude to present.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nHe also mistakenly identified a photograph of Ms Carroll as being of his former wife, Marla Maples, directly undercutting that \"not his type\" assertion.\n\nIn the 2020 presidential election, suburban voters, particularly women, recoiled from Mr Trump's brand of brash politics. The jury's ruling in this case can only push those kinds of voters farther away from him.\n\nThe former president was defiant on his social media platform, calling the verdict a disgrace and insisting he had no idea who \"this woman\" was. Outside court, his lawyer told reporters Mr Trump would appeal.\n\nUp until now, the former president has run a fairly disciplined campaign to regain the White House in 2024. His team has methodically built up grass-roots support in key primary states across the country. His focused attacks on his rival Ron DeSantis appear to be drawing blood. He has managed to turn his New York indictment into a badge of honour among his base.\n\nThe sexual abuse and defamation ruling could give his Republican opponents an avenue for attack, however. If they can rattle him the way Ms Carroll's lawyer did, forcing him off message and into a defensive crouch, it could knock a candidate seemingly in control of his party into committing more unforced errors.\n\nAt the very least, it is another historic first for a former president who already faces one criminal indictment and has possibly others to come.\n\nUp until now, Mr Trump has shrugged off such legal concerns. But the New York jury's decision lands a blow against Mr Trump in a way that mere \"investigations\" do not. A jury of everyday Americans have considered the evidence and found that Mr Trump did wrong.\n\nNone of it bodes well for those other legal headaches, including special counsel Jack Smith's inquiry into the former president's involvement in the attack on the US Capitol and his handling of classified documents after he left the White House, as well as Georgia's investigations of Mr Trump's attempt to reverse that state's 2020 presidential election results.\n\nWhile it's unlikely in the extreme that Mr Trump would ever take the stand if those investigations turn into indictments - or will testify in the current New York indictment - prosecutors may look for ways to use the former president's statements or previous testimony against him as effectively as Ms Carroll's lawyer did.", "Thousands of rail workers will strike on three days in July as part of a long-running dispute about pay and conditions.\n\nStrikes at 14 rail firms have been called on 20, 22 and 29 July, the RMT union said.\n\nIt said negotiations with rail firms and the government had stalled.\n\nBut train operators said the action was \"totally unnecessary\" and urged the union to put the latest pay offer to its members.\n\nPrevious strikes in the dispute have caused widespread disruption.\n\nUnions are pushing for more pay as the cost of living rises rapidly, but rail firms have said they will not pay more without concessions on conditions.\n\nThe RMT said 20,000 of its members, including guards, train managers and station staff, would walk out after train operators did not make a new offer.\n\nIts general secretary, Mick Lynch, said that train operators and the government had not \"made any attempt whatsoever to arrange any meetings or put forward a decent offer that can help us reach a negotiated solution\".\n\n\"The government continues to shackle the companies and will not allow them to put forward a package that can settle this dispute,\" he added.\n\nThe latest strike dates coincide with sporting events including the fourth and fifth Ashes Tests and the Open golf championship.\n\nUnions say any pay offer should reflect the rising cost of living. Inflation - the pace of general price rises - is at 8.7%.\n\nThe latest pay offer from the Rail Delivery Group (RDG) which represents train operators, was a backdated pay rise of 5% for 2022.\n\nUnions would then have to agree to reforms before members could get a second year's pay rise of 4%, negotiated with individual operators.\n\nThe BBC understands that rail operators are willing to negotiate with the RMT, but want the union to put the latest pay offer to its members before taking further action.\n\nThe RDG said more strikes were \"totally unnecessary\", and that all the RMT had achieved was losing its members more money than they would have received from pay offers.\n\n\"We have now made three offers that the RMT executive have blocked without a convincing explanation,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nA senior rail source said union members had lost \u00a32,000 of pay through strike action so far.\n\n\"Negotiation has got us nothing. We have compromised on pay, job protections and issues like driver-only trains,\" the source said.\n\n\"Nothing is ever enough, Every one of our offers has been rejected - not even by our staff who have not cast a single vote. No more ransom demands, the industry must change to survive,\" the source added.\n\nThe Department for Transport said the strikes were \"targeting two iconic international sporting events\" and would disrupt families at the beginning of the school holidays in England and Wales.\n\n\"After a year of industrial action, passengers and rail workers alike are growing tired of union bosses playing politics with their lives,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nThe government has helped train operators put forward \"fair and reasonable pay offers that would see generous increases for rail workers,\" the spokesperson said. \"Union leaders should do the right thing and give their members a chance to vote on these pay offers.\"\n\nThe strikes announcement comes on the day that Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said wage rises \"cannot continue\" at the rate they have been if inflation is to come down, reiterating Bank calls for restraint from workers.\n\nThe union's industrial action began a year ago, and last month members voted for another six months of action.\n\nIndustry group UK Hospitality said the rail strikes were a \"hammer blow\" for firms including pubs, bars and restaurants.\n\n\"Strike disruption over the past year has already cost the hospitality sector \u00a33.25bn in lost sales and there is no doubt that figure will increase as a result of these strike days,\" said the group's chief executive Kate Nicholls.", "The Strawberry Moon looked golden over Europe's tallest street art in Leicester\n\nThe Full Moon marking the start of meteorological summer has been seen glowing in the sky above England.\n\nPhotographers captured images of the Strawberry Moon, which was visible from just after 21:00 BST on Saturday until just before 04:30 on Sunday.\n\nThe Strawberry Moon (here in Overseal, Derbyshire) reached peak illumination at 03:42 BST on Sunday\n\nIts name is thought to come from Algonquian tribes in North America, with June being the month when strawberries begin to ripen for picking.\n\nHistorically, names like this would have served a purpose, helping to monitor the changing seasons.\n\nThe Strawberry Moon was glowing above the historic castle on St Michael's Mount, Cornwall\n\nThe Strawberry Moon (here in Flockton in West Yorkshire) marks the start of meteorological summer\n\nPhotographer Michael Wake captured the Strawberry Moon rising over the lighthouse on Roker Pier in Sunderland.\n\n\"I stood on the Seaburn promenade, just under and a mile from the lighthouse,\" he said.\n\n\"At first, the moonrise was hidden behind a blanket of clouds, and I wasn't sure if it would appear.\n\n\"Thankfully it did, and as it rose into the sky, it got brighter and brighter, then turned a beautiful red and orange.\"\n\nMichael Wake said the Strawberry Moon got brighter and brighter as it rose over Roker Pier in Sunderland\n\nAlthough it appeared spectacular, the Strawberry Moon was not considered a supermoon.\n\nThe first supermoon of 2023 - when a Full Moon is also at its closest point to Earth along this orbit - is expected in August.\n\nThe Strawberry Moon seen from Breedon on the Hill, Leicestershire\n\nThis close-up of the Strawberry Moon was taken in East Leake, Nottinghamshire\n\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, or on Instagram.

It is an important story in the public interest.\"\n\nSteyn \"drew a reasonable conclusion from the facts\", but \"drew only one conclusion\", GB News continued.\n\n\"We accept that the data offered several valid interpretations, and he should have made this clear. Had he done so, the story would have remained within the wide freedoms that Ofcom's Broadcast Code allows.\"\n\nAt the heart of most misinformation that spreads online is a fact or genuine set of figures that has been twisted or taken out of context.\n\nThat can lend such misleading claims an air of authority, making them very convincing.\n\nThis is what happened here. Mark Steyn took official statistics on illness and deaths in people who received two doses of the Covid vaccine, and compared them with those who received three. But he failed to give context: that far fewer people in the general population took the third booster dose than the first two jabs, and that the third dose was particularly popular with older people - who have a higher risk of dying in any case.\n\nIn fact, when the Office for National Statistics adjusted the figures to take into account the number of people, and the age of those who had taken it, it found people who had taken three doses were considerably less likely to die.\n\nIt can be easy - and tempting - to cherry-pick real stats in a way that supports what we already believe.\n\nNow Ofcom seems to be emphasising that, to borrow a phrase, we are all entitled to our own opinion but not to our own facts.\n\nSteyn left GB News three months ago amid a dispute over contract terms he claimed could have made him personally liable for Ofcom fines.\n\nOfcom said it was not imposing a fine or other sanction.\n\nSteyn's programme is also the subject of a second Ofcom investigation into comments made by a guest, author and journalist Naomi Wolf, about the vaccine on 4 October.\n\nA Twitter account run by his team posted a picture of the Ofcom office with the caption \"The Ministry of Truth Rules\", linking to a statement headlined \"Steyn found guilty!\", which also said: \"Mark intends to appeal this and get it before a real court.\"", "Telecoms giant BT is to shed up to 55,000 jobs by the end of the decade, mostly in the UK, as it cuts costs.\n\nUp to a fifth of those cuts will come in customer services as staff are replaced by technologies including artificial intelligence.\n\nThe headcount reduction from the current workforce of 130,000 includes staff and contractors.\n\n\"Whenever you get new technologies you can get big changes,\" said chief executive Philip Jansen.\n\nHe said \"generative AI\" tools such as ChatGPT - which can write essays, scripts, poems, and solve computer coding in a human-like way - \"gives us confidence we can go even further\".\n\nMr Jansen said AI would make services faster, better and more seamless, adding that the changes would not mean customers will \"feel like they are dealing with robots\".\n\n\"We are multi-channel, we are online, we have 450 stores and that's not changing at all,\" he said.\n\n\"There are plenty of opportunities for our customers to deal with people at BT, plenty of people to speak to.\"\n\nMr Jansen added that \"new technologies drive new jobs\", although BT has said it will have a\"much smaller workforce\" by the end of the 2020s.\n\nBT, which is the UK's largest broadband and mobile provider, is currently continuing to expand its fibre network as it moves away from copper. The company said that once the work was completed it would not need as many staff to build and maintain its networks.\n\nIn addition, newer, more efficient technology, including artificial intelligence, means fewer people will be needed to serve customers in future, it said.\n\nThe move comes shortly after Vodafone said it would axe a tenth of its staff over the next three years, equating to 11,000 jobs.\n\nMr Jansen said BT would become \"a leaner business with a brighter future\", with the firm planning to get rid of between 40,000 and 55,000 jobs by 2030.\n\nThe firm has about 80,000 employees in the UK, and this is where the bulk of the cuts will come. It has about 20,000 staff abroad.\n\nIt also has 30,000 contractors, mainly abroad. Many of those roles will go.\n\nThe Communications and Workers Union (CWU) said the BT announcement was \"no surprise\".\n\n\"The introduction of new technologies across the company, along with the completion of the fibre infrastructure build replacing the copper network, was always going to result in less labour costs for the company in the coming years,\" a CWU spokesperson said.\n\nBut the union said it wants BT to keep as many of its core employees as possible, with job cuts coming from sub-contractors \"in the first instance\", and through roles not being replaced as people leave the business.\n\nThe BT announcement was made as it reported a 12% drop in profits of \u00a31.7bn for the year to April.\n\nIts shares fell more than 7% after its results fell short of analysts' expectations.\n\nJames Barford, head of telecoms research at Enders Analysis, said the BT job cuts were mostly about fewer people being needed in building networks, whereas the Vodafone cuts were \"more general efficiency savings\".\n\nHe said that in both cases plans were \"already broadly in place, with savings previously described in monetary terms rather than headcount reduction\".\n\nPossibly, the firms are now talking about job cuts \"to help convince sceptical investors that they will actually deliver the promised savings\", Mr Barford added.\n\u2022 None BT and unions agree pay rise of up to 16%", "Discounter Lidl has won a trademark battle against the UK's biggest supermarket chain Tesco.\n\nThe High Court ruled that Tesco's Clubcard logo copied Lidl's logo, which both use a yellow circle on a square blue background.\n\nLidl said Tesco had infringed its copyright, letting Tesco \"take unfair advantage\" of Lidl's \"reputation for great value\".\n\nTesco said it was \"disappointed\" by the ruling and that it intended to appeal.\n\nLidl started its lawsuit in 2020, shortly after Tesco started using the logo to promote its Clubcard discount scheme.\n\nIt argued that Tesco deliberately copied its trademark to deceive customers into thinking its prices were comparable.\n\nJudge Joanna Smith said in a written ruling on Wednesday that Tesco had \"taken unfair advantage of the distinctive reputation\" for low prices held by Lidl's trademarks.\n\nHowever, she said that Tesco had not been seeking \"deliberately to ride on the coat tails of Lidl's reputation\", as Lidl had argued.\n\nA Lidl spokesperson said: \"We are pleased that the court has agreed with us and that it will now order Tesco to stop using the Clubcard logo.\"\n\nTesco said it planned to appeal against the ruling, which a spokesperson described as being \"just about the colour and shape of the Clubcard Prices logo\".\n\n\"It has no impact on our Clubcard Prices scheme which we will continue to run in exactly the same way,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nTesco said nearly 21 million households use its Clubcard scheme, with 11.7 million Clubcard app users.

He denied all the charges, but did admit to having met the woman.\n\nThe trial was a sharp contrast to the career so far of the man once feted as a \"rock star\" of Islamic thought.\n\nAs Europe struggled with terrorist attacks and rising anti-Muslim feeling, Mr Ramadan appeared as a voice of reason - condemning terrorism and opposing the death penalty. He was denied entry to Tunisia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Libya, and Syria, because, he said, he had criticised their lack of democracy.\n\nIn 2004 he was voted one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people in the world.\n\nIn 2007 he became a professor of Islamic studies at St Antony's College Oxford. He also had his critics, particularly in France, where a number of leading academics accused him of anti-Semitism.\n\nBut in 2017, Mr Ramadan's meteoric rise ended, when he was accused by a French woman of rape.\n\nSupporters of Mr Ramadan protested on the streets of Paris following the allegations in France\n\nWhen that case became public, more women came forward.\n\nBy 2020 he was facing five charges of rape - four in France, and one in Switzerland - and had spent nine months in detention in France before being released on probation. He has consistently denied all the charges against him.\n\nThe Swiss case was the first to come to trial, and the atmosphere in the Geneva courtroom was tense.\n\nMr Ramadan faced a barrage of cameras as he arrived. His accuser, using the name Brigitte to protect her identity, requested a screen be put up in the courtroom so she would not have to look at the man she claimed raped her.\n\nShe described the alleged attack in detail, saying she feared she would die.\n\nMr Ramadan admitted inviting her to his hotel room, but denied any form of violence. He said all the accusations against him have been politically motivated and designed to discredit him.\n\nHis French and Swiss lawyers also questioned the accusers' truthfulness, citing inconsistencies around the dates of the alleged attacks.\n\nMr Ramadan was supported in that argument by his family. His son Sami, pointing to his father's \"role in the debate about Islam in France,\" told the BBC in 2019 that the cases against his father were \"motivated by other reasons, which we feel are political.\"\n\nThat view was backed by dozens of high-profile figures, including American philosopher Noam Chomsky, and British filmmaker Ken Loach, who signed an open letter questioning whether Mr Ramadan was receiving a fair legal process, with the usual presumption of innocence.\n\nIn court in Geneva, the prosecution insisted Brigitte could not have invented the alleged attack or have been able to tell it to the judges in such detail.\n\nMr Ramadan's defence lawyer insisted on his innocence, describing the charges against him as \"crazy\". In his own remarks to the court, Mr Ramadan asked not to be tried on his \"real or supposed ideology\".\n\nAfter a week's deliberation, the three Swiss judges found him innocent.\n\nWhile he has been cleared in Switzerland, this could be just the first of several trials.\n\nIn France, prosecutors are still assessing whether charges brought against Mr Ramadan should go to court.\n\nHe continues to protest his innocence in all the cases, and has vowed to clear his name.", "The mural has appeared at Blacksole Farm\n\nA new Banksy mural has appeared on the wall of a derelict farmhouse in the seaside town of Herne Bay, Kent.\n\nThe mural, called Morning is Broken, shows a young boy opening curtains made of corrugated iron alongside a cat.\n\nThe anonymous artist confirmed they were the creator of the piece in a post shared to Instagram.\n\nIn the post, it appears the piece - and part of the building - had been demolished.\n\nThe artwork had appeared on the side of a derelict farmhouse on Blacksole Farm.\n\nOwners of the land, Kitewood, said demolition work is currently being undertaken at the site.\n\nIn February, another installation created by Banksy, called Valentine's Day Mascara, appeared in Margate.

The first minister said the UK government was trying to 'undermine devolution'\n\nFirst Minister Humza Yousaf has accused the UK government of sabotaging a pilot recycling scheme by excluding glass.\n\nGlass bottles were a key part of Scottish proposals for the deposit return scheme (DRS), due to start in March - ahead of other UK schemes.\n\nThe UK government agreed for the scheme to go ahead in Scotland, but said it wanted to ensure it \"aligned\" with plans in other nations.\n\nThe move casts doubt over whether the Scottish scheme can go ahead.\n\nMr Yousaf told the BBC: \"They're not just trying to scupper the DRS - they're trying to undermine devolution. We've seen it multiple times.\n\n\"Not only is it bad in terms of devolution and self government, it's really poor for the environment. If we don't include glass that's 600 million bottles that won't be moved from our streets, our beaches and our parks.\"\n\nThe drinks industry previously shared concerns about the scheme's readiness\n\nBBC Scotland's political editor Glenn Campbell said one source closely involved in the DRS had put the chances of it going ahead at 50/50.\n\nThe Scottish government is expected to take a couple of weeks to crunch the numbers before making a decision.\n\nThe scheme is aimed at increasing the number of single-use drinks bottles and cans that are recycled.\n\nIt means 20p will be added to the price of a single-use drinks container, which will be refunded to people who return it to a retailer or hospitality premises that offer single-use products.\n\nThe scheme was due to begin in August but was delayed following concerns from the drinks industry.\n\nSome firms feared it would place extra costs and other burdens on them at a time when they are already struggling.\n\nSimilar UK initiatives are expected in 2025 - with proposals in Wales including glass bottles.\n\nBecause Scottish ministers wanted to introduce their scheme sooner, they had to seek an exemption from the Internal Market Act.\n\nThe legislation was brought in after Brexit in a bid to ensure smooth trade across the different nations of the UK.\n\nThere had been concerns that the timing of a Scottish scheme could create a trade barrier.\n\nOn Saturday morning the UK government confirmed it had accepted the Scottish government's request \"on a temporary and limited basis\".\n\nThe exemption from internal market rules lasts from the launch of the Scottish scheme until other planned schemes are in place in the rest of the UK.\n\nScotland's DRS will cover PET plastic, aluminium, and steel cans only.\n\nA UK government spokesperson said: \"Deposit return schemes need to be consistent across the UK and this is the best way to provide a simple and effective system.\n\n\"A system with the same rules for the whole UK will increase recycling collection rates and reduce litter - as well as minimise disruption to the drinks industry and ensure simplicity for consumers.\"\n\nMr Yousaf previously claimed it would be a \"democratic outrage\" for the UK government to agree to the DRS excluding glass.\n\nHowever Scottish Conservative MSP Maurice Golden said the situation was a mess of the Scottish government's own making.\n\nHe said: \"Rather than trying to pick a fight, the SNP and Greens must now accept this help to create a deposit return scheme that actually works for the people of Scotland.\"\n\nLorna Slater had urged Westminster to \"do the right thing\" and allow the scheme to go ahead\n\nScottish Greens co-leader Lorna Slater, who had been driving the introduction of the DRS, said the Scottish Parliament had been \"treated with contempt\".\n\nThe decision to exclude glass meant she would have to look \"very seriously\" at the viability of the Scottish scheme, she said.\n\nMr Yousaf added that millions of pounds had been spent on a scheme that proposed to include glass.\n\nHe said he did not want to go ahead with a scheme that excluded glass, but would look at the various options.\n\nFor it to work effectively, the Scottish deposit return scheme needs an exemption from the rules of the UK internal market act.\n\nThe Scottish government has asked for that and - on the face of it - their request has now been granted by the UK government. So what's the problem?\n\nThere are strings attached. A tangle of conditions including the exclusion of glass that make the Scottish government wonder whether their proposals are still viable.\n\nUK ministers will argue they are acting on a practical basis, to ensure any Scottish scheme aligns with future developments in other parts of the UK.\n\nThere are certainly businesses that welcome their intervention and others that may have an axe to grind against government at some level, having shelled out to prepare for a scheme that would include glass.\n\nTo Scottish ministers this is a power play by the UK government - an outrageous interference in devolved decision making akin to the block on gender reform legislation and resistance to indyref2.\n\nThe British Soft Drinks Association (BSDA) has said the \"only viable option now\" was for a UK-wide initiative to be launched across all four nations in 2025.\n\nDougal Sharp, founder of brewer Innis and Gunn, said uncertainty over the scheme made things \"brutal and impossible to plan\".\n\nBrewer Dougal Sharp said businesses had faced enough uncertainty in recent years\n\nHe said: \"Businesses are already spending a lot of money on this scheme in Scotland. It just feels like another twist and a very shambolic scheme implementation.\n\n\"We've already seen it delayed from August. All of these delays inevitably lead to weakened consumer confidence and particularly business confidence.\n\n\"Businesses cannot plan in this environment. Businesses are struggling to survive and this is absolutely the last thing we need at the moment.\"", "A new drone attack on Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia power plant has raised the risk of a \"major nuclear accident\", the UN's atomic watchdog has warned.\n\nRussia said Ukraine was behind the attack, which it said injured three people. Ukraine has denied involvement.\n\nThe giant Russian-held nuclear plant, with six reactors, is on the frontline of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n\nThe UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has repeatedly warned against such attacks.\n\nIAEA head Rafael Grossi said Sunday's drone strike was \"reckless\" and \"a major escalation of the nuclear safety and security dangers\" facing the plant.\n\nThe Zaporizhzhia plant, in southern Ukraine, is the largest in Europe. Russian forces seized it shortly after launching their February 2022 full-scale invasion and have occupied it ever since.\n\nThe IAEA, which has a team of experts at Zaporizhzhia, confirmed \"physical impact of drone attacks\" at the plant, including at one of the reactors.\n\nThe plant's Russian-installed administration said radiation levels were normal and that there was no serious damage.\n\nThe IAEA said the damage had not compromised nuclear safety, but it warned that \"this is a serious incident with potential to undermine [the] integrity of the reactor's containment system\".\n\nMr Grossi specified there had been \"at least three direct hits\" against the plant's \"main reactor containment structures\".\n\n\"This cannot happen,\" he said. \"No one can conceivably benefit or get any military or political advantage from attacks against nuclear facilities. This is a no go.\"\n\nBoth Russia and Ukraine regularly accuse each other of shelling the plant and risking a serious nuclear accident.\n\nRussia has occupied the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant since early 2022\n\nThe plant's Russian administration has said Ukraine's armed forces were behind the attack, but Ukraine has denied the allegation.\n\n\"Ukraine was not involved in any armed provocations on the site,\" Ukrainian Main Intelligence Directorate spokesman Andriy Yusov told the Ukrainska Pravda news website. The plant is \"illegally occupied by Russia,\" he added.\n\nMr Yusov accused Russia of endangering the nuclear facility, the civilian population and the environment by carrying out strikes on the plant itself.\n\nLast month the IAEA said its team of experts at the plant had heard explosions every day for a week.\n\nAt the time, Mr Grossi said: \"For more than two years now, nuclear safety and security in Ukraine has been in constant jeopardy. We remain determined to do everything we can to help minimise the risk of a nuclear accident that could harm people and the environment, not only in Ukraine.\"", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. PRONI: 'It's like a window into the past'\n\nA treasure trove of Northern Ireland's rarest historical records is being showcased as part of a new project.\n\nOne hundred significant documents are being collated by the public records office to mark its centenary year.\n\nIt includes diaries from the Irish famine and handwritten accounts from the Easter Rising.\n\nIt also features minutes of a meeting in the aftermath of the sinking of the Titanic as directors of Harland and Wolff recorded the deaths.\n\nThe Public Record Office of Northern Ireland (PRONI) is the official place of deposit for historical records in Northern Ireland and is part of the Department for Communities.\n\nThe office also collects a wide range of archives from private sources and currently holds about three and a half million records.\n\nThe Public Records Office of Ireland, which was based in the Four Courts in central Dublin, was destroyed in 1922 by fire in the Irish Civil War, along with countless precious records.\n\nPRONI was then established in Northern Ireland in 1924, just after the partition of Ireland.\n\nIt is now highlighting some of its rarest documents as part of year-long events marking its centenary.\n\nPRONI's acting director David Huddleston said: \"We're highlighting these 100 documents in our centenary year in the hope that it will help the public realise they have access to all this history that they mightn't realise is here.\n\n\"Although we've been collecting for a century, we have documents that go back many hundreds of years, it's like having a window into the past.\"\n\nLynsey Gillespie, PRONI's outreach and engagement officer, said a handwritten account of the 1916 Easter Rising was one of her favourite documents in the centenary collection.\n\nA diary written by a County Down woman during a trip to Dublin in April 1916 is part of the collection\n\nIt is a diary written by Eva Chichester from County Down during a trip to Dublin in April 1916.\n\nMs Gillespie said: \"She's going on a bit of a girls' trip for some shopping, but when she gets down there, what we now know as the Easter Rising kicks off and she's just furious that her plans have been up ended.\n\n\"So it's a really different perspective on this hugely historical event.\"\n\nA Royal Patent from 1622 is part of the collection\n\nOther documents in the collection include a Royal Patent from 1622 appointing James Hamilton as Viscount Clandeboye. It includes a coloured and gilded royal portrait.\n\nA Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association poster from 1968 reading 'A civil rights march will be held in Derry on Saturday, 5th Oct' is also in the collection.\n\nAnd there is a file containing detailed notes of the first formal meeting between NIO officials and a Sinn F\u00e9in delegation led by Martin McGuinness in 1994.\n\nThe collection includes a a diary of a County Down farmer recorded between 1818 and 1864\n\nDiaries of farmer James Harshaw from Donaghmore in County Down recorded between 1818 and 1864 also appear in the collection, giving an account of life through a turbulent period, including the potato famine.\n\nThere is a letter from 1885 relating to teenage sisters who emigrated from County Fermanagh to the USA to make a new life, covering everything from romance to religion and politics.\n\nThe full list containing the 100 items will be unveiled at an event in June on the anniversary of the legislation that created the records office.", "A cache of classified US documents leaked online sheds new light on American intelligence gathered about other countries.\n\nImages of the covert files have appeared on messaging app Discord since early March.\n\nComplete with timelines and dozens of military acronyms, the documents, some marked \"top secret\", paint a detailed picture of the war in Ukraine and also offer information on China and allies.\n\nPentagon officials are quoted as saying the documents are real.\n\nBBC News and other news organisations have reviewed the documents and these are some of the key findings.\n\nThe US believed the UN secretary general's stance on a key grain deal was undermining attempts to hold Russia accountable for the war in Ukraine.\n\nAntonio Guterres was too willing to accommodate Russian interests, according to files which suggest Washington has been closely monitoring him.\n\nSeveral documents describe private communications involving Mr Guterres and his deputy.\n\nOne leaked document focuses on the Black Sea grain deal, brokered by the UN and Turkey in July following fears of a global food crisis.\n\nIt suggests that Mr Guterres was so keen to preserve the deal that he was willing to give in to Russia's demands - a stance which was \"undermining broader efforts to hold Russia accountable\".\n\nWhile the bulk of the leaked documents concern, in one way or another, the war in Ukraine, there are others that touch on a huge range of unrelated issues. Many of them shed light on some of Washington's global preoccupations.\n\nLike the spread and purpose of Chinese technology.\n\nThe documents appear to have been printed out and folded before being photographed and posted online\n\nThree documents based on intelligence from late February detail discussions among senior Jordanian officials over whether or not to shut the Chinese firm Huawei out of its 5G rollout plans.\n\nJordan's Crown Prince Hussein, in charge of the rollout, is said in the document to be worried about retaliation from China if they keep Huawei out.\n\nNor is this the only place where fears about Chinese technology are revealed\n\nAnother document marked top secret addresses China's \"developing cyber-attack capabilities.\" It says these are designed \"to deny, exploit, and hijack satellite links and networks as part of its strategy to control information, which it considers to be a key warfighting domain.\"\n\nNewly discovered documents suggest Russian officials are at loggerheads over the reporting of casualties.\n\nThe main intelligence agency, the FSB, has \"accused\" the country's defence ministry of playing down the human impact of the war, the files show.\n\nThese findings show the extent to which the US agencies have penetrated the Russian intelligence and military.\n\nOne document, dated 23 March, refers to the presence of a small number of Western special forces operating inside Ukraine, without specifying their activities or location. The UK has the largest contingent (50), followed by Latvia (17), France (15), the US (14) and the Netherlands (1).\n\nWestern governments typically refrain from commenting on such sensitive matters, but this detail is likely to be seized upon by Moscow, which has in recent months argued that it is not just confronting Ukraine, but Nato as well.\n\nOther documents say when a dozen new Ukrainian brigades - being prepared for an offensive that could begin within weeks - will be ready. They list, in great detail, the tanks, armoured vehicles and artillery pieces that are being provided by Ukraine's Western allies.\n\nOne map includes a timeline that assesses ground conditions across eastern Ukraine as spring progresses.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post newspaper, one document from early February expresses misgivings about Ukraine's chances of success in its forthcoming counteroffensive, saying that problems with generating and sustaining sufficient forces could result in \"modest territorial gains\".\n\nUkraine's difficulties in maintaining its vital air defences are also analysed, with warnings from late February that Kyiv might run out of critical missiles.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

One slide refers to as many as 223,000 Russian soldiers killed or wounded, and as many as 131,000 Ukrainians.\n\nSome Ukrainian officials have dismissed the leaks, suggesting they might constitute a Russian disinformation campaign. But there are signs of frustration and anger too.\n\nOne presidential advisor, Mykhailo Podolyak, tweeted: \"We need less contemplation on 'leaks' and more long-range weapons in order to properly end the war.\"\n\nPresident al-Sisi is said to have told officials to keep production of rockets for Russia secret - but an Egyptian official says the allegation is baseless\n\nThe Washington Post obtained access to another document from mid-February, where they found that Egypt had plans to produce 40,000 rockets for Russia in secret.\n\nThe Post said President Abdul Fatah al-Sisi told officials to keep production and shipment secret \"to avoid problems with the West\".\n\nAn official is quoted as saying he would \"order his people to work shift work if necessary because it was the least Egypt could do to repay Russia for unspecified help earlier\".\n\nIt is unclear what the earlier help refers to. In January, Reuters reported that Russia's share of Egyptian wheat imports had risen in 2022, offering one possible explanation.\n\nThere is no indication that Egypt - a recipient of US security assistance, worth around $1bn a year - went ahead with the proposed sale to Russia.\n\nAn unnamed official quoted on Egyptian news channels described the allegation as \"utterly baseless\" and said Cairo did not take sides in the war.\n\nThe Kremlin called it \"just another canard\" and the White House said there was \"no indication\" Egypt was providing lethal weapons to Russia.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Expert: US and Egypt ready to move forward after leak\n\nA classified document, seen by the BBC, reveals that South Korea was torn about selling weapons for use in Ukraine.\n\nThe report, based on signals intelligence, details a sensitive conversation between national security advisers.\n\nThey are torn between US pressure to send ammunition to Ukraine and their policy not to arm countries at war.\n\nOne of the advisers suggests sending the shells to Poland instead, to avoid appearing to have given in to the US.\n\nAs part of a resupply deal last year, Seoul insisted that the US could not pass the shells on to Ukraine. Seoul has been reluctant to arm Ukraine, for fear of antagonising Russia.\n\nThe leak has triggered security concerns in Seoul, with opposition politicians questioning how the US was able to intercept such a high-level conversation.\n\nThe Post also found that Beijing tested one of its experimental missiles - the DF-27 hypersonic glide vehicle - on 25 February.\n\nThe missile flew for 12 minutes over a distance of 2,100km (1,300 miles), according to the documents.", "Dmitry Mishov: \"I am an officer, not an accomplice in a crime\"\n\nA military defector who fled Russia on foot has given a rare interview to the BBC, in which he paints a picture of an army suffering heavy losses and experiencing low morale.\n\nLieutenant Dmitry Mishov, a 26-year-old airman, handed himself into the Lithuanian authorities, seeking political asylum.\n\nDmitry said escaping from Russia in such dramatic fashion, with a small rucksack on his back, was his last resort.\n\nHe is among a small handful of known cases of serving military officers fleeing the country to avoid being sent to Ukraine to fight - and the only case of a serving airman that the BBC knows of.\n\nDmitry, an attack helicopter navigator, was based in the Pskov region, in north-western Russia. When the aircraft started to be prepared for combat, Dmitry sensed a real war was coming, not just drills.\n\nHe tried to leave the air force in January 2022 but his paperwork had not gone through by the time Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February. He was sent to Belarus where he flew helicopters delivering military cargo.\n\nDmitry says he never went to Ukraine. We cannot verify this part of his story but his documents appear to be genuine and many of his statements match what we know from other sources.\n\nIn April 2022 he returned to his base in Russia where he hoped to continue his decommissioning. It was a lengthy process which was close to completion - but in September 2022 President Putin announced partial military mobilisation. He was told he would not be allowed to leave the army.\n\nHe knew that sooner or later he would be sent to Ukraine and started looking for ways to avoid it.\n\n\"I am a military officer, my duty is to protect my country from aggression. I don't have to become an accomplice in a crime. No one explained to us why this war started, why we had to attack Ukrainians and destroy their cities?\"\n\nHe describes the mood in the army as mixed. Some men support the war, he says, some are dead against it. Very few believe they are fighting to protect Russia from real danger. This has long been the official narrative - that Moscow was forced to resort to a \"special military operation\" to prevent an attack against Russia.\n\nOverwhelming and common, according to Mishov, is unhappiness with low salaries.\n\nHe says experienced air force officers are still paid their pre-war contract salary of up to 90,000 roubles (\u00a3865, $1090). This is while new recruits are being tempted into the army with 204,000 roubles (\u00a31960, $2465) as part of an official and publicly advertised campaign.\n\nDmitry says that while attitudes towards Ukraine may vary, no one in the army believes official reports about things going well at the front or about low casualties.\n\nDmitry Mishov's documents prove his rank and position in the army\n\n\"In the military no one believes the authorities. They can see what is really happening. They are not some civilians in front of the telly. The military do not believe official reports, because they are simply not true.\"\n\nHe says that while in the early days of the war the Russian command was claiming no casualties or losses of kit, he personally knew some of those who had been killed.\n\nBefore the war his unit had between 40 and 50 aircraft. In the first few days after the start of the Russian invasion, six had been shot down and three destroyed on the ground.\n\nRussian authorities rarely report military casualties. Last September, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said Russia had lost around 6,000 men, a figure most analysts, including pro-Kremlin military bloggers considered an underestimate.\n\nIn the most recent instalment of a research project identifying Russian servicemen killed in the war in Ukraine, BBC Russian's Olga Ivshina compiled a list of 25,000 names and in many cases ranks of soldiers and officers. Real figures, including those missing in action, she believes, are much higher.\n\nDmitry describes losses among military air crews as extremely high. This matches findings in an investigation Olga Ivshina has been conducting which found that Russia lost hundreds of highly skilled servicemen, including pilots and technicians, whose training is time-consuming and costly.\n\n\"Now they can replace the helicopters, but there are not enough pilots,\" Dmitry says. \"If we compare this to the war in Afghanistan in the 1980s, we know that the Soviet Union lost 333 helicopters there. I believe that we've experienced the same losses in one year.\"\n\nIn January this year, Dmitry was told he was going to be sent \"on a mission\".\n\nRealising that it could mean only one thing - going to Ukraine - he resorted to a suicide attempt. He hoped that this would lead to his decommissioning on health grounds. But it did not.\n\nWhile he was recovering in hospital, he read an article about a 27-year ex-police officer from the Pskov region who had successfully escaped to Latvia. Dmitry decided to follow his example.\n\n\"I was not refusing to serve in the army as such. I would serve my country if it faced a real threat. I was only refusing to be an accomplice in a crime.\n\n\"Had I boarded that helicopter, I would have taken the lives of several dozen people, at the very least. I didn't want to do that. Ukrainians are not our enemy.\"\n\nDmitry searched for help on Telegram channels to plot a route through the woods on the EU border. He packed as light as he could.\n\nHe says walking through the woods was terrifying as he feared being stopped by border guards.\n\n\"Had they arrested me, I could have gone to prison for a long time.\"\n\nHe says at one point a flare launched somewhere close to him and then another one. He panicked that this was border guards coming after him and started running.\n\n\"I couldn't see where I was going, my thoughts were in disarray.\"\n\nHe came to a wire fence and climbed over it. Soon he knew he made it.\n\nA reconstruction of the moment Dmitry felt he could breathe freely\n\nDmitry assumes the Russian authorities will start a criminal case against him. But he believes many of his army comrades will understand his motivation.\n\nSome had even advised him to try and hide in Russia, but he thinks even in a country that vast he would not have escaped being found and punished for desertion.\n\nHe does not know what will happen to him next.\n\nBut Dmitry says he prefers to try and build a new life in the EU than be on tenterhooks at home.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. The BBC's Archana Shukla in Cuttack: ''Distress and chaos'' at the hospital treating the train crash injured\n\nPeople found guilty over a deadly rail accident in eastern India will be \"punished stringently\", the country's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said.\n\nAt least 288 people were killed and more than 800 injured in Friday's incident in Odisha state, involving two passenger trains and a goods train.\n\nRescue efforts have concluded, with officials saying all trapped and injured passengers have been retrieved.\n\nMr Modi has visited the scene, labelling the incident a \"painful\" one.\n\nHe also met victims of the disaster in hospital, and vowed that his government would leave \"no stone unturned for the treatment of those injured\".\n\nIt is still not clear what caused the multi-train collision in Balasore district, which has been described as India's worst rail accident this century.\n\nA full investigation has been launched, but a preliminary report indicates that the accident was the result of signal failure, said KS Anand, chief public relations officer of the South Eastern Railway.\n\nSome 2,000 passengers are thought to have been on board the two passenger trains involved.\n\nThe exact sequence of events has been the subject of conflicting accounts.\n\nOfficials say several carriages from the Coromandel Express, travelling between Kolkata (formerly Calcutta) and Chennai (formerly Madras), derailed at about 19:00 (13:30 GMT) after hitting a stationary goods train. It remains unclear how the Express ended up on the same track as the goods train.\n\nSeveral of the Coromandel Express's coaches then ended up on the opposite track. Another train travelling in the opposite direction - the Howrah Superfast Express travelling from Yesvantpur to Howrah - collided with derailed carriages.\n\n\"The Coromandel Express was supposed to travel on the main line, but a signal was given for the loop line instead, and the train rammed into a goods train already parked over there,\" Mr Anand said.\n\n\"Its coaches then fell on to the tracks on either side, also derailing the Howrah Superfast Express,\" he said.\n\nSounds of ambulance sirens have been going off every 30 minutes outside the trauma centre in the SCB hospital in the city of Cuttack - where critically injured passengers have been wheeled in.\n\nSo far, close to 200 passengers from the train accident site have been brought in, and the numbers continue to rise.\n\nThe hospital is the largest in the state of Odisha, but is still three hours' drive from the accident site.\n\nThe hospital staff - from junior doctors to nurses and ward boys - have been lined up and waiting in groups to assist patients as they are brought in. Wards have been expanded to handle the numbers coming in.\n\nThe constant sounds of whistles and announcements by hospital authorities interrupt the chaos.\n\nFamily members of the injured are waiting anxiously outside praying for their relatives' wellbeing.

Five prime suspects were previously known, and two were convicted in 2012. White died in 2021.\n\nThe BBC found that witnesses had said White told them he had been present during the attack, that evidence showed his alibi was false, and that police surveillance photos of White showed a resemblance to eyewitness accounts of an unidentified fair-haired attacker.\n\nEvidence also revealed more mistakes by police, raised questions over the Metropolitan Police's decision to stop investigating in 2020, and further implicated suspects who are still alive.\n\nMr Mansfield told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that White \"should have been and could have been charged\" before his death.\n\nEvidence implicating other suspects - including one witness who said White had admitted he was present and had named others in the attack - could still be used against them, the barrister said. \"It's possible to put them on trial in this matter,\" he said.\n\nTory MP Sir Peter Bottomley, who represented Eltham at the time of the murder, told Radio 4's the World At One the BBC investigation showed the crime \"would have been solved within hours\" if the police had given proper attention to the eyewitness evidence from Duwayne Brooks, Stephen's friend who was with him at the time of the attack.\n\nHe said the police also needed to explain the \"unjustified decision\" to remove Clive Driscoll, the senior detective who had convicted two of the suspects, from the case.\n\nAn artist's impression of the \"fair-haired attacker\", a surveillance photo of Matthew White and a police e-fit\n\nMr Brooks, who gave police a description of the lead attacker which resembled White, said: \"I never received the basics of support because of my skin colour. Police forces and other criminal justice agencies need to know that their treatment of victims and witnesses must be at minimum what is set out in the victims code.\"\n\nBaroness Lawrence said in a statement that the BBC's revelations of new failings by the Met Police were \"shocking but unsurprising\" after 30 years in which mistakes in the investigation have been laid bare.\n\n\"What is infuriating about this latest revelation is that the man who is said to have led the murderous attack on my son has evaded justice because of police failures and yet not a single police officer has faced or will ever face action,\" she said.\n\n\"It should not have taken a journalist to do the job that a huge, highly resourced institution should have done.\"\n\nShe said only when police officers lose their jobs for such failings can the public be reassured that incompetence will not be tolerated.\n\n\"The failure to properly investigate a main suspect in a murder case is so grave that it should be met by serious sanctions,\" she said.\n\nDuwayne Brooks (L) with Stephen Lawrence's father Neville outside the High Court in London in 2015\n\nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct, which investigates serious allegations against the police, said it is still waiting after more than two years for prosecutors to decide whether four former officers should face charges of misconduct in a public office over their handling of the case.\n\nThe Crown Prosecution Service said more material has been provided since the file was handed over.\n\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan told broadcasters: \"If there's evidence of failings, of misconduct, it's really important action is taken.\"\n\nHe said he welcomed the police's assurance that they would investigate any new information, following the BBC's revelations.\n\nMr Khan said: \"This investigation wasn't done by police officers, it was done by journalists. This stuff should have been known by police officers 30 years ago, not journalists 30 years later.\"\n\nLabour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said it was \"concerning\" that prosecutors had been examining the file on possible police misconduct for years and said decisions on this and any further necessary investigations should be made urgently.\n\n\"The Lawrence family have already endured so much injustice, they should not have to keep waiting for answers and action,\" she said.\n\nJack Straw, who as home secretary ordered a landmark public inquiry into the case, said he was \"frankly astonished\" that evidence uncovered by the BBC was available at the time but was never brought to him or to the head of the inquiry, Sir William Macpherson.\n\nHe told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that it was clear to him some \"corrupt officers\" had been withholding information.\n\nDet Ch Insp Andy George, president of the National Black Police Association, said there was \"certainly a case\" to reopen the investigation into the murder.\n\n\"I don't think it should have ever been closed and I think it's a stain on the Metropolitan Police that it was,\" he told LBC News.\n\n\"I think it needs to be taken on by an external force and it needs to be looked at by them. Somebody else needs to come in now, and not only review it but follow on with those investigative lines.\"\n\nIn response to the BBC investigation, the Met took the almost unprecedented step of naming White as a suspect. The force apologised again for its handling of the case.\n\nIt said the failure to trace one key witness, a relative of White, for 20 years was a \"significant and regrettable error\".\n\nNew evidence about the murder of Stephen Lawrence, uncovered by BBC investigative reporter, Daniel De Simone.\n\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.", "Police moved to arrest a group of protesters in Piccadilly as the annual Pride parade got under way\n\nFive Just Stop Oil protesters have been charged over demonstrations which briefly led to London's annual Pride parade being delayed.\n\nImages on social media on Saturday showed police removing demonstrators who managed to briefly stop the march.\n\nSeven people were arrested by the Metropolitan Police.

dubbed a post-Brexit bonfire - would see laws that were copied over to the UK after Brexit vanish, unless specifically kept or replaced.\n\nCritics of the bill had voiced concern that it could lead to important legislation falling away by accident.\n\nBut the climbdown is likely to trigger anger from Brexit-backing Conservative MPs and members of the House of Lords.\n\nBusiness Secretary Kemi Badenoch said the cut-off point would be replaced with a list of 600 laws the government wants to replace by the end of the year.\n\nIn a statement, she said the change would be made through an amendment when the Retained EU Law Bill returns to Parliament next week.\n\nTory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, who introduced the bill when he was in government, called the move an \"admission of administrative failure\".\n\nIt showed an \"inability of Whitehall to do the necessary work and an incapability of ministers to push this through their own departments,\" he added.\n\nHe said the move to ditch the deadline represented the triumph of \"the blob\" - a term used by some Tory MPs to describe the Whitehall establishment.\n\nThe UK incorporated thousands of EU laws into UK law to minimise disruption to businesses when the UK officially left the EU in 2020 - with an ongoing audit by civil servants having identified 4,800 so far.\n\nSince September 2021, it has been reviewing this body of legislation to identify opportunities to give British firms an edge over European competitors.\n\nThe Retained EU Law Bill, which began its journey through Parliament during Liz Truss's premiership, would have introduced a 31 December cut-off date for most of these laws to expire, unless ministers replaced or decided to retain them.\n\nHowever opposition parties, trade unions and campaign groups cast doubt on whether the deadline was realistic, given the huge workload in reviewing the legislation.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch acknowledged the deadline had created \"legal uncertainty\" for businesses.\n\nShe said the government had already got rid of, changed or replaced around 1,000 EU-era laws - and was still committed to \"lightening the regulatory burden on businesses\".\n\nBut she added that the \"growing volume\" of EU laws identified during the ongoing audit had started to get in the way of \"meaningful reform\".\n\nWriting in the Telegraph, she added: \"Getting rid of EU law in the UK should be about more than a race to a deadline\".\n\nHowever, Labour called the move a \"humiliating u-turn,\" accusing ministers of trying to \"rescue this sinking ship of a bill\".\n\n\"After wasting months of parliamentary time, the Tories have conceded that this universally unpopular bill will damage the economy,\" said Jenny Chapman, Labour's shadow Cabinet Office minister.\n\nLiberal Democrat peer Lord Fox said the Conservatives had \"dug themselves into a hole\" with the bill, adding: \"While they may have stopped digging, they're still in the hole\".\n\nAsked about Ms Badenoch's article, David Penman, chair of the civil servants' union the FDA, said he read it as a criticism of an \"artificial deadline\" championed by the former business secretary, Mr Rees-Mogg.\n\n\"If you set an artificial deadline, what is a government department going to do? It's going to focus on the things that need to be retained in government,\" Mr Penman told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday.

Watch: Ros Atkins on... Brexit and the clash over EU laws\n\nThe bill was passed by MPs in January, but was expected to run into significant opposition when it faces further scrutiny in the House of Lords.\n\nPeers were meant to start debating the bill last month, but the government was reported to have put it on hold until last week's local elections in England were over.\n\nThe government is still expected to face opposition from peers over new powers for ministers to amend or replace EU laws using secondary legislation, a fast-track process that attracts less scrutiny in Parliament.\n\nOpposition MPs, and some Conservatives, say this would rob Parliament of a meaningful say over what is changed.\n\nAround 500 EU laws covering financial services had been exempted from the deadline, as they are due to be repealed by a separate bill making its way through the Commons. The same is expected for EU legislation affecting VAT and customs.\n\nHowever, the footprint of EU-era legislation is particularly large when it comes to environmental regulation.\n\nCampaign groups have warned about a loss of rights and legal protections in areas including water quality, air pollution standards and protections for wildlife.\n\nThe move to get rid of the deadline may be a pragmatic move, but is likely to disappoint MPs on the right of the Conservative Party and leave Prime Minister Rishi Sunak open to the charge he's not delivering the benefits of Brexit he promised.\n\nMr Sunak had promised during his unsuccessful leadership campaign last summer to publish a list of which EU laws would be retained or scrapped within 100 days of taking office.\n\nHowever, he did not keep the pledge after taking office in October after he was chosen to replace Liz Truss as prime minister by Conservative MPs.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: Ros Atkins on... the Russian social media videos appearing to show Kremlin drone attack\n\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has denied his country carried out an alleged drone attack on the Kremlin, which Russia says was an attempt on President Vladimir Putin's life.\n\n\"We don't attack Putin or Moscow. We fight on our territory. We are defending our villages and cities,\" he said, speaking on a visit to Finland.\n\nThe Russian president's office said defences downed two drones overnight.\n\nIt threatened to retaliate when and where it considered necessary.\n\nUnverified footage circulating online shows smoke rising over the Kremlin - a large government complex in central Moscow - early on Wednesday. A second video shows a small explosion above the site's Senate building, while two men appear to clamber up the dome.\n\nThe Russian presidency said Ukraine had attempted a strike on Mr Putin's residence in the Kremlin and described it as \"a planned terrorist act and an assassination attempt on the president\".\n\nOfficials said two drones targeting the complex had been disabled using electronic radar assets, adding that President Putin had not been in the complex at the time of the alleged attack.\n\nBut Ukraine has said the Russian accusations are merely a pretext for massive attacks on its territory and the US says it is treating the Russian claims with a lot of caution.\n\nMr Putin appears to be one of the most closely-guarded leaders in the world. At Putin events in Moscow attended by BBC journalists, extremely tight security has been in place, including extensive checks and long convoys of vehicles with airspace closed and traffic halted.\n\nHowever if what the Kremlin is saying is true, it will raise questions about how well protected the president really is.\n\nThere will also be scrutiny over the effectiveness of Russian air defences. In recent months, anti-aircraft systems have been spotted on Moscow rooftops in the vicinity of key buildings.\n\nThey have been placed there because the Kremlin is concerned that Ukraine, or those sympathetic to Ukraine, may attempt to carry out aerial attacks on high-value targets.\n\nWhatever actually happened on Wednesday morning, the question now is how Russia will respond. Some officials have already called for tough action. Russian generals have warned many times of harsh responses to any strikes on Russian territory.\n\nBut it is unclear whether Russia has the capacity to carry out meaningful retaliatory strikes, or whether this incident will lead to any significant escalation on the battlefield inside Ukraine.\n\nA Ukrainian presidential adviser told the BBC the incident indicated Russia could be \"preparing a large-scale terrorist provocation\" in Ukraine.\n\nMykhailo Podolyak said attacking Moscow made no sense for Ukraine but would help Russia justify its own attacks on civilian targets.\n\nOn Wednesday Russian strikes on Ukraine's southern Kherson region killed 21 people. Mr Zelensky said the shelling had hit \"a railway station and a crossing, a house, a hardware store, a grocery supermarket and a gas station\". The victims included supermarket customers and employees of an energy company who were performing repairs, officials said.\n\nMr Podolyak added that any drones flying over locations in Russia were down to \"guerrilla activities of local resistance forces\".\n\n\"Something is happening in RF [Russian Federation], but definitely without Ukraine's drones over the Kremlin,\" Mr Podolyak said.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he could not validate Russia's accusation that Ukraine had tried to kill Mr Putin, but said he would take anything the Russian presidency said with a \"very large shaker of salt\".\n\nMick Mulroy, a former US deputy assistant secretary of defence and CIA officer, told the BBC that if reports of the incident were accurate, it was \"unlikely\" to be an assassination attempt as Ukraine tracks President Putin's movements closely and he was not in Moscow at the time.\n\n\"This may have been to show the Russian people that they can be hit anywhere and that the war they started in Ukraine may eventually come home to Russia, even the capital,\" he said.\n\nAlternatively, if the reports were not accurate, \"Russia may be fabricating this to use as a pretext to target President Zelensky - something they have tried to in the past\", Mr Mulroy said.\n\nRussia also noted the alleged drone incident had come shortly before Russia's 9 May Victory Day parade in Moscow, which foreign dignitaries were expected to attend.\n\nThe parade will go ahead as planned, Russian officials said.\n\nMoscow's mayor on Wednesday announced a ban on unauthorised drone flights over the city.\n\nSeveral Russian cities had already announced they would scale back this year's Victory Day celebrations.\n\nRussian authorities have cited security reasons and attacks from pro-Ukrainian forces for the changes.

A spokesperson for the US National Security Council said: \"We don't think cuts are advisable at this moment given market uncertainty - and we've made that clear.\"\n\nHigh energy and fuel prices have helped to drive up inflation - the rate at which prices rise - putting pressure on many households' finances.\n\nYael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG, warned that the oil price surge could make the battle to bring down inflation harder.\n\nHowever, she said that rising oil prices won't necessarily lead to higher household energy bills.\n\n\"The energy price cap, that households benefit from, has already been determined using earlier market expectations,\" she said. \"Plus, when you look at energy use in households, it tends to be more gas-heavy rather than oil.\"\n\nThere have also been fears that there could be an impact on transport costs, if fuel prices rise.\n\nThe RAC said it does not expect this to happen in the short-term.\n\n\"Any sudden increase in the cost of oil shouldn't result in a rise in the UK average price of petrol for a fortnight, unless of course the barrel price stays higher for several days,\" RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams told the BBC.\n\nThe reduction in output is being made by members of the Opec+ oil producers. The group accounts for about 40% of all the world's crude oil output.\n\nSaudi Arabia is reducing output by 500,000 barrels per day and Iraq by 211,000. The UAE, Kuwait, Algeria and Oman are also making cuts.\n\nA Saudi energy ministry official said the move was \"a precautionary measure aimed at supporting the stability of the oil market\", the official Saudi Press Agency said.\n\nNathan Piper, an independent oil analyst, told the BBC the move by Opec+ appeared to be an attempt to keep the oil price above $80 a barrel in the medium term, given that demand could be hit by a weakening global economy and sanctions have had a \"limited impact\" on restricting Russian oil supplies.\n\nThis surprise announcement is significant for several reasons.\n\nDespite price fluctuations in recent months, there were concerns that global demand for oil would outstrip supply, especially towards the end of the year. The increase in oil prices following Sunday's announcement could potentially put more pressure on inflation - worsening the cost-of-living crisis and raising the risk of recession.\n\nInterestingly, this announcement came just a day before the Opec+ meeting. There were indications from members that they would stick to the same production policy, meaning there would be no fresh cuts, which is why it has come as a huge surprise.\n\nThe development will also likely further strain ties between the US and Saudi Arabia-led Opec+. The White House had called on the group to increase supplies to cool down prices and check Russian finances.\n\nHowever, Sunday's announcement also underlines the close cooperation between oil-producing countries and Russia.\n\nThe latest reductions come on top of a cut announced by Opec+ in October last year of two million barrels per day (bpd).\n\nHowever, last year's cut came despite calls from the US and other countries for oil producers to pump more crude.\n\nWhen the Opec+ group announced its production cuts in October, US President Joe Biden said he was \"disappointed by the short-sighted decision\".", "Father-of-four Pat McCormick was described as a gentle man who was the victim of a brutal and sustained assault\n\nA man who murdered a County Down father of four, disposed of his body in a wheelie bin and dumped it in a lake must serve at least 16 years in prison before being considered for release.\n\nPat McCormick's body was discovered near Ballygowan six weeks after he was last seen on CCTV in Comber.\n\nDavid Gill, 30, of no fixed abode, was sentenced on Thursday after admitting the murder of the 55-year-old.\n\nFive people were sentenced in connection with Mr McCormick's murder.\n\nSpeaking to media gathered outside the court in Belfast afterwards, Mr McCormick's 18-year-old daughter Morgan paid tribute to her dad.\n\n\"We've been stripped of our father,\" she said.\n\n\"My dad will never get to see any of us grow up or get married.

The ferry crossing that runs parallel to the bridge was also affected.\n\nRussian officials urged holidaymakers stranded in Crimea to drive home through areas of southern Ukraine occupied by Russia since its army invaded last year. The officials said they would reduce curfew hours to let tourists through and that the army would keep the route \"safe\".\n\nCommercial flights between Russia and Crimea - a popular holiday destination for Russians since 2014 - have been suspended since Moscow's invasion.\n\nVyacheslav Gladkov, governor of the western Russian region of Belgorod which is close to Russia's border with Ukraine, said in a Telegram statement that a Russian couple had died in Monday's incident. He added that their 14-year-old daughter had been injured.\n\nUnverified photos posted by the spokesperson for Ukraine's military administration in the Odesa region showed debris on the road across the bridge, as well as damaged railings.\n\nDefence analyst Stuart Crawford told the BBC he believed that drones had been used to attack the bridge.\n\nHe also said details around what happened would likely remain unclear as neither side would want to release much information.\n\nRussian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accused Ukraine of attacking the Kerch bridge with the \"direct participation\" of the UK and the US, but provided no evidence to back up the assertions.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there was no connection between the incident and Russia's decision to suspend its participation in a deal allowing Ukraine to ship out grain through the Black Sea.\n\nThe alleged attack is the second major incident on the Kerch bridge in the past year.\n\nIn October 2022, the bridge was partially closed following a huge explosion. It was fully reopened in February.\n\nEven now, the exact cause of the explosion last October remains unclear. Footage from the time showed a huge fireball erupting as a number of cars and lorries made their way across the bridge.\n\nThe latest incident comes amid a much-anticipated counter-offensive by Ukrainian forces which aims to retake territory in southern and eastern Ukraine.\n\nUkraine's forces have retaken 18 sq km (7 sq miles) over the past week in their fightback, Ukraine's deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said on messaging app Telegram.\n\nThe recent gains take the total area of reclaimed land to 210 sq km (81 sq miles) since the counter-offensive began.", "\"It's hard to hear the criticisms\u2026 undoubtedly, we don't always hear well,\" says the Bishop of Birkenhead\n\nA support scheme set up for Church of England abuse survivors risks re-traumatising victims, a report seen by the BBC has concluded.\n\nOne man's dealings with the scheme left him suicidal, says the report by the Church's Independent Safeguarding Board (ISB).\n\nOther survivors told the BBC they have been treated with contempt.\n\nThe Church's lead on abuse engagement has apologised to victims who have had a \"poor experience\".\n\nThe Bishop of Birkenhead, Julie Conalty says \"others have had positive experiences\".\n\nThe Interim Support Scheme (ISS) was set up in August 2020 to support victims of abuse who are in urgent need of financial help.\n\nTwo months later, a landmark inquiry into child abuse within the Church of England concluded that compensation should be paid to victims and survivors. A full compensation scheme is yet to be created.\n\nTo use the ISS, a person must provide evidence that they are a survivor of Church abuse and in need of financial help. But some victims have told the BBC they have found it difficult, because they don't want to have to re-engage with the Church.\n\nThe Bishop of Birkenhead has told the BBC that the Church is \"trying to get it right\".\n\n\"It's hard to hear the criticisms\u2026 Undoubtedly, we don't always hear well,\" she said.\n\nThe Church says it has paid out \u00a31.4m to 68 survivors.\n\nWhen contacted by the BBC it said it did not want to comment specifically on the ISB report or the cases of any individuals accessing the scheme.\n\nIn its report, the safeguarding board looked at the experience of one individual - referred to as \"Mr X\" - who become suicidal as a result of the way his requests for support were handled by the scheme.\n\nMr X was abused as a child by individuals in the Church of England and this led to \"substantial health and financial impacts\", the report says.\n\nIt said the support scheme appeared to have been \"set up in haste, underthought and under-resourced\".\n\nThe Church \"failed to grasp that a longer term, co-ordinated, intervention was required to help Mr X get back on his feet.\"\n\nThe authors warn of a lack of \"effective central grip or oversight\" and that if survivors' needs were not properly managed it could result in \"repeated re-traumatisation\".\n\nSophie Whiting says she had her support payments stopped without notice or explanation\n\nTrying to get help from the scheme has taken its toll on other victims the BBC has spoken to.\n\n\"It's regular engagement.

Medical reviews have found that her health has been permanently damaged by drugs she was given there.\n\n\"This medical condition was forced on me through no fault of my own. The least they could have done was look after me,\" Ms Cooper says. \"They are supposed to be Christians, they are supposed to be caring.\"\n\nThe Church recently apologised for having criticised abuse survivors for \"horrific abuse and bullying\" towards Church staff.\n\nBishop Conalty has told the BBC it was a misjudgement that had served as a distraction from the \"main issue\".\n\n\"I think survivors understandably felt that through the comments that were made that the blame was being placed on them.\"\n\nBishop Conalty said she was unable to comment on individual cases. She admitted to the difficulties of survivors having to prove to the Church that they need help, but said it could not be avoided.\n\n\"As a scheme that's set up in order to meet need, there has to be some evidence of the need, and some evidence of how the money is spent,\" she says.\n\nThe survivors the BBC have spoken to have said they are desperate to have their final compensation claims settled, so they no longer have to deal with the Church of England.", "Boris Johnson has submitted a last-ditch letter to the MPs investigating whether he misled Parliament over lockdown parties, as they prepare to publish their findings.\n\nThe privileges committee said it was \"dealing with\" submissions received from the former PM at 23:57 on Monday.\n\nThe committee is set to publish its conclusions this week, but is unlikely to do so on Wednesday, as expected.\n\nMr Johnson quit as an MP last week after seeing the committee's report.\n\nIn a statement, Mr Johnson said the committee should \"publish their report and let the world judge their nonsense\", adding \"they have no excuse for delay\".\n\n\"I have made my views clear to the committee in writing -

Many refugees have since been living in hotels across the UK.\n\nMr Mercer said the thousands of people who left Afghanistan were housed in \"bridging hotels\" which were never meant to be permanent.\n\nHe added that of the 24,500 people now living in the UK under the two resettlement schemes, about 8,000 remained in hotels, with about half of those being children - costing \u00a31m a day.\n\nThe government says that Afghans make up a fifth of all people living in bridging hotels.\n\nMr Mercer said the long-term residency in hotels has \"prevented some Afghans\" from putting down roots, committing to employment and integrating into communities, as well as creating uncertainty.\n\nBut campaigners said the new policy would cause anxiety and upheaval for refugees who had already experienced trauma, and could leave Afghans at risk of becoming homeless.\n\nAfter its withdrawal from Afghanistan, the UK pledged to resettle up to 20,000 more vulnerable Afghans under the ACRS.\n\nThe government will begin writing to families and individuals housed in hotels at the end of April, giving them \"at least three months' notice\" before they are forced out, Mr Mercer told the Commons.\n\nHe promised \"generous\" support, with trained staff based at hotels to provide advice - including Home Office staff and charity workers.\n\nThe veterans minister said \u00a335m of funding would help councils provide increased support and the local authority housing fund would be expanded by \u00a3250m.\n\nThe increased fund for local authorities will help councils to source homes for Afghan refugees currently in hotels, the government says.\n\nMr Mercer noted there was a \"national duty\" owed to Afghan refugees who helped British forces during the war.\n\nHe added that \"in return, we do expect families to help themselves\" and where an offer of accommodation was turned down, \"another will now not be forthcoming\".\n\nHe said: \"At a time when there are many pressures on the taxpayer and the housing market, it is not right that people can choose to stay in hotels when other perfectly suitable accommodation is available.\"\n\nVeterans Minister Johnny Mercer announced the plan in the Commons\n\nEnver Solomon from the Refugee Council said the government's plan risked people being left \"homeless and destitute on the streets of Britain\".\n\nHe said: \"This is not how those who were promised a warm welcome in the UK should be treated.\"\n\nGovernment plans to resettle Afghans who had worked with the UK during the war were initially named Operation Warm Welcome.\n\nMr Solomon added: \"To expect councils to suddenly move them out of hotels by putting pressure on Afghan families risks causing great misery and anxiety for those who have already experienced trauma and upheaval.\"\n\nLabour called on the government to ensure no Afghans would be left homeless.\n\nShadow defence secretary John Healey accused the government of \"serving eviction notices on 8,000 Afghans - half of whom are children - with no guarantee they will be offered a suitable, settled place to live\".\n\nHe said: \"Never mind 'Operation Warm Welcome', never mind the warm words from the minister today. He has confirmed the government is giving them the cold shoulder.\"\n\nLiberal Democrat Home Affairs spokesperson Alistair Carmichael the public would \"have no faith in this initiative\".\n\n\"They have proven time and time again they cannot treat refugees, including women and young children, with the respect they deserve.\"\n\nLib Dem MP Munira Wilson said the government's promise of help for those who remained in danger in Afghanistan was \"utterly hollow\".\n\nShe said she had repeatedly raised the case of five British children who were still \"living in hiding\" in Kabul and had been \"abandoned\" by the government.\n\nThe Local Government Association (LGA) said councils would need extra resources to help find and fund the accommodation or there would be a risk of a further increase in homelessness.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nOn Friday, in the dead of night at the heart of the Colombian jungle, army radios crackled to life with the message the nation had been praying for: \"Miracle, miracle, miracle, miracle.\"\n\nThe military code revealed that four children missing in the jungle for 40 days had all been found - alive.\n\nThe youngsters, all members of the indigenous Huitoto people, had been missing since the light plane they were travelling in crashed into the Amazon in the early hours of 1 May.\n\nThe tragedy killed their mother and left the children - aged 13, nine, four and one - stranded alone in an area teeming with snakes, jaguars and mosquitos.\n\nRescuers initially feared the worst, but footprints, partially eaten wild fruit and other clues soon gave them hope that the children might be alive after they left the crash site looking for help.\n\nOver the next six weeks, the children battled the elements - and the odds - in what Colombia's President Gustavo Petro called \"an example of total survival which will remain in history\".\n\nIf there were ever children well-prepared to tackle such an ordeal, the Mucutuy family were the ones.\n\nHuitoto people learn hunting, fishing and gathering from an early age, and their grandfather Fidencio Valencia told reporters that the eldest children, Lesly and Soleiny, were well acquainted with the jungle.\n\nSpeaking to Colombian media, the children's aunt, Damarys Mucutuy, said the family would regularly play a \"survival game\" together growing up.\n\n\"When we played, we set up like little camps,\" she recalled. Thirteen-year-old Lesly, she added, \"knew what fruits she can't eat, because there are many poisonous fruits in the forest. And she knew how to take care of a baby\".\n\nFidencio Valencia told reporters that the children had grown up learning to take care of themselves in the jungle\n\nAfter the crash, Lesly built makeshift shelters from branches held together with her hair ties.\n\nShe also recovered fari\u00f1a, a type of cassava flour, from the wreckage of the Cessna 206 plane they had been travelling in.\n\nThe children survived on the flour until it ran out and then they ate seeds, Edwin Paki, one of the indigenous leaders who took part in the search effort, told reporters.\n\n\"There's a fruit, similar to passion fruit, called avichure,\" he said. \"They were looking for seeds to eat from an avichure tree about a kilometre and a half from the site of the plane crash.\"\n\nThe fruit from the avichure tree, also known as milk tree, is rich in sugar and its seeds can be chewed like chewing gum.\n\nHenry Guerrero, one of the indigenous people who was part of the search team that finally located the children, said they had also been eating fruits from the Bacaba palm tree known locally as \"milpesos\", which are rich in oil and taste similar to avocados.\n\nHe said one of the young children had a seed from the tree in his mouth when they found him.\n\nAstrid C\u00e1ceres, head of the Colombian Institute of Family Welfare, said the timing of their ordeal meant \"the jungle was in harvest\" and they could eat fruit that was in bloom.\n\nBut they still faced significant challenges surviving in the inhospitable environment.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Mundo on Saturday, indigenous expert Alex Rufino said the children were in \"a very dark, very dense jungle, where the largest trees in the region are\".\n\nAnd while there are leaves with which the children could purify water, he warned that \"others are poisonous\".\n\n\"It is an area that has not been explored. The towns are small, and they are next to the river, not in the jungle,\" he added.\n\nIn addition to avoiding predators, the children also endured intense rainstorms and may have had to evade armed groups said to be active in the jungle.\n\nBut Mr Rufino noted that a 13-year-old raised in an indigenous community would already possess many of the skills needed to thrive in such an environment.\n\nJohn Moreno, leader of the Guanano group in Vaup\u00e9s, in the south-eastern part of Colombia where the children were brought up, said they had been \"raised by their grandmother\", a widely respected indigenous elder.\n\n\"They used what they learned in the community, relied on their ancestral knowledge in order to survive,\" he said.\n\nAs the search continued, officials in Bogota came under pressure over its slowness. President Petro faced criticism after his office falsely published a tweet saying the children had been found.\n\nAuthorities dropped 10,000 leaflets with survival tips written in Spanish and the indigenous Huitoto language, and helicopters blared messages from their grandmother from speakers to reassure the children they were being looked for.\n\nBut unbeknownst to the media, the army was coming increasingly close to finding the family. On several occasions rescue teams passed within 20 to 50 metres (66 to 164ft) of where the children were found, search commander Gen Pedro S\u00e1nchez said.\n\nBy the time the children were discovered, about 150 troops and 200 volunteers from local indigenous groups were involved in the operation, which was combing an area of more than 300 sq km (124 sq miles).\n\n\"This isn't a search for a needle in a haystack, it's a tiny flea in a vast carpet, because they keep moving,\" Gen Sanchez told reporters during the hunt.\n\nBut on Friday, after a month-long search, specialist rescue dogs found the children.\n\nThe first words from eldest daughter Lesly, who was holding the baby in her arms, was \"I'm hungry,\" one of the rescuers told Colombia's RTVC. One of the boys, who had been lying down, got up and said: \"My mum is dead.\"\n\nIt later emerged that the children's mother had survived in the jungle for four days after the plane crash. \"Before she died, their mum told them something like, 'You guys get out of here'\" said the children's father, Manuel Ranoque.\n\nA video shared by Colombia's ministry of defence showed the children being lifted into a helicopter in the dark, above the tall trees. They have been flown to the nation's capital, Bogota, where ambulances have taken them to hospital for further medical treatment.\n\nThe children's family thanked the army for continuing their search despite the low odds of survival, and they urged the government to bring the children home as soon as possible.\n\n\"I never lost hope, I was always supporting the search. I feel very happy, I thank President Petro and my 'countrymen' who went through so many difficulties,\" their grandmother told state media.\n\nPresident Petro also hailed the efforts of the army and the volunteers, praising \"the meeting of knowledge: indigenous and military\", adding that \"this is the true path of peace\".\n\nBut he reserved special praise for the children and their relationship with the environment.\n\n\"They are children of the jungle, and now they are also children of Colombia,\" he said.\n\nWhile many in deeply Catholic Colombia have referred to the children's rescue as a \"miracle\", Mr Rufino, the indigenous expert, said the real story lay in their \"spiritual connection with nature\".\n\n\"The jungle is not only green, but there are ancient energies with which the populations relate, learn and help each other,\" he said.\n\n\"It is difficult to understand this, I know, but this is a good opportunity for society, human beings, to learn about the different worldviews that exist in the territories.\n\n\"The same mother, who became a spirit after the accident, protected them,\" he said. \"And only now is she going to start resting.\"", "Peter Murrell's home has been searched by police\n\nFormer SNP chief executive Peter Murrell has been released without charge by the police, pending further investigation into party finances.\n\nMr Murrell, 58, the husband of former first minister Nicola Sturgeon, was arrested on Wednesday morning.\n\nHe was questioned while police searched their Glasgow home and SNP headquarters as part of their investigation.\n\nMs Sturgeon said she had \"no prior knowledge\" of Police Scotland's plans. The force said inquiries were ongoing.\n\nIn a statement, Police Scotland said Mr Murrell was arrested at 07:45 and released shortly before 19:00.\n\n\"Officers also carried out searches today at a number of addresses as part of the investigation,\" the statement added.\n\n\"A report will be sent to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service.\"\n\nMr Murrell resigned as SNP chief executive last month, after holding the post since 1999.\n\nHe has been married to Ms Sturgeon since 2010.\n\nMs Sturgeon was inside the house when officers arrived to make the arrest\n\nA spokesperson for the former first minister said she was not warned about Police Scotland's \"action or intentions\" before the arrest.\n\nThey added: \"Ms Sturgeon will fully cooperate with Police Scotland if required, however at this time no such request has been made.\"\n\nMs Sturgeon was succeeded last week as Scotland's first minister by Humza Yousaf.\n\nFollowing Mr Murrell's arrest Mr Yousaf said that it was \"a difficult day\" for the SNP.

The party pledged to spend these funds on the independence campaign.\n\nQuestions were raised after its accounts showed it had just under \u00a397,000 in the bank at the end of 2019, and total net assets of about \u00a3272,000.\n\nPolice officers carried boxes out of SNP headquarters following the search\n\nLast year it emerged Mr Murrell gave a loan of more than \u00a3100,000 to the SNP to help it out with a \"cash flow\" issue after the last election.\n\nThe then SNP's chief executive loaned the party \u00a3107,620 in June 2021. The SNP had repaid about half of the money by October of that year.\n\nAt the time an SNP spokesman said the loan was a \"personal contribution made by the chief executive to assist with cash flow after the Holyrood election\".\n\nHe said it had been reported in the party's 2021 accounts, which were published by the Electoral Commission in August last year.\n\nWeeks earlier, MP Douglas Chapman had resigned as party treasurer saying he had not been given the \"financial information\" to do the job.\n\nMr Murrell resigned last month after taking responsibility for misleading statements about a fall in party membership.\n\nThe number of members had fallen from the 104,000 it had two years ago to just over 72,000.\n\nThe release of Peter Murrell without charge isn't the end of this matter. Detectives will send the results of their long investigation to prosecutors who'll decide what happens next.\n\nThe Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service will have to be satisfied that there's sufficient admissible evidence to justify a prosecution.\n\nThey'll consider whether there's enough to show a crime was committed and the suspect was responsible. They'll also take the public interest into account.\n\nThat can be influenced by the particular circumstances of the case - for example, whether the person involved was in a position of trust or authority.\n\nIf they feel that there's insufficient evidence, they can instruct the police to carry out further inquiries. And after that, if the Fiscal still isn't satisfied that there's enough to take it to court, the case would go no further.\n\nNeedless to say, all of this will take time.", "Presenter Jon Kay said BBC Breakfast was \"delighted to be championing 500 Words\"\n\nThe children's writing competition 500 Words is to be relaunched by BBC One's Breakfast programme, three years after it was dropped from Radio 2.\n\nFirst launched by Chris Evans on Radio 2's own breakfast show in 2011, the popular UK-wide contest continued with his successor Zoe Ball until 2020.\n\nIt will return in September, again backed by the Queen Consort Camilla.\n\nThe BBC's chief content officer, Charlotte Moore, said the corporation was \"thrilled\" to be bringing it back.\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

Police bodycam captured the Tasering and arrest of triple murderer Saju Chelavelel\n\nA father who strangled his wife and two children has been jailed for at least 40 years.\n\nNurse Anju Asok, 35, Jeeva Saju, six, and Janvi Saju, four, were found fatally injured in the family home in Kettering on 15 December 2022.\n\nA judge told Saju Chelavalel he had \"squeezed the life out\" of his wife while the children screamed for mummy.\n\nDet Insp Simon Barnes said: \"There is no amount of time behind bars that will ever be enough for what he did.\"\n\nThe judge, Mr Justice Pepperall, jailed him for life at Northampton Crown Court, and ordered that he must serve a minimum of 40 years.\n\nThe bodies of Anju Asok, her son Jeeva Saju and daughter Janvi Saju were discovered after police forced entry into their home in Kettering\n\nOriginally from Kerala in India, Chelavalel said he believed his wife was having an affair and claimed he lost control while drunk, killing her at around 22:00 GMT on 14 December at their ground-floor flat.\n\nThe court heard Chelavalel had more than four hours \"to reflect on whether to kill his children\" before using a dressing gown cord to strangle them in the early hours of the following morning.\n\nMs Asok died at the scene and the children died later in hospital.\n\nPost-mortem examinations found all three victims died from asphyxiation, Northamptonshire Police said.\n\n\"While you were squeezing the life out of your wife, your young children were screaming for their mummy,\" said the judge.\n\n\"I cannot be sure if they were eyewitnesses, but it is clear that they heard what was going on and knew that she was being hurt by you.\"\n\nSaju Chelavalel, 52, admitted to the triple murder of his wife and children\n\nProsecutor James Newton-Price KC said there was no evidence to support the claim Ms Asok had been unfaithful.\n\nHowever, an examination of Chelavalel's phone showed that he had been searching dating websites for other women while she was at work.\n\nThe court was played an audio recording found on his phone of banging noises followed by the sound of a woman screaming or gasping and a child crying or calling out.\n\nMr Newton-Price said it was the prosecution's belief that it was a recording of Ms Asok being strangled.\n\nHe said the it also captured the sound of a blender being used to make a \"toxic\" mixture of chocolate and pills intended to send the children - pupils at Kettering Park Infant Academy - to sleep.\n\nThe court heard that police officers attended the flat after receiving a call from a neighbour who was concerned for the family's welfare.\n\nMs Asok had failed to turn up for work as an orthopaedic nurse at Kettering General Hospital and the children were not at school.\n\nBody-worn camera footage showed that, after breaking into the flat, officers found Chelavalel holding a knife to his throat. He asked the police to shoot him and said that he wanted to die, before he was Tasered.\n\nThe body of Ms Asok was found on the floor of an adjoining bedroom. The couple's children were described in a police statement as \"laying perfectly side-by-side on the double bed\".\n\nOffering mitigation, defence barrister George Carter-Stephenson KC said the circumstances of the case were tragic in the extreme for relatives of the victims.\n\nHe said: \"They are also tragic for this particular defendant. Whatever sentence the court imposes on him today he has to live with the knowledge of what he did on that particular night.\"\n\nIn addition to his jail term, Chelavalel was prohibited from contacting any of his victims' family members.\n\nDet Insp Simon Barnes from Northamptonshire Police said: \"Anju was a mother like many all over the world. She wanted to provide the best possible life she could for her children - Jeeva and Janvi.\n\n\"He [Chelavalel] has never fully accounted for what he did, or why, and will now spend the rest of his life with not much else to think about, but that.\n\n\"There is no amount of time behind bars that will ever be enough for what he did. His primary role as a husband and a father, was to protect his family from harm. They should have been at their safest, at home, with him, but he destroyed that.\n\n\"They leave behind them a devastated family in India, who are struggling to come to terms with what has happened.\"\n\nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

They also insisted that the embassy \"was not a target\".\n\nThe New York Times also cited four Israeli officials as confirming that Israel had carried out the strike but denying the building had diplomatic status.\n\nIsrael has acknowledged carrying out hundreds of strikes in recent years on targets in Syria that it says are linked to Iran and allied armed groups which are armed, funded and trained by the Revolutionary Guards.\n\nThe strikes have reportedly been stepped up since the start of the war in Gaza in October last year, in response to cross-border attacks on northern Israel by Hezbollah and other Iran-backed groups in Lebanon and Syria.\n\nIran has so far avoided direct confrontation with Israel during the conflict, but Monday's attack is seen as a serious escalation.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nOn Tuesday, Iran's president said the Revolutionary Guards commanders had been in Syria \"as senior advisers in defending the holy shrine\" - an apparent reference to a revered site on the outskirts of Damascus believed to house the tomb of Sayyida Zeinab, the daughter of the first Shia Muslim imam.\n\n\"Having failed to destroy the will of the resistance front, the Zionist regime [Israel] has put blind assassinations back on its agenda to save itself,\" Mr Raisi added. \"It must know that it will never achieve its goals and that this cowardly crime will not go unanswered.\"\n\nLater, Iran's supreme leader also vowed to avenge the Revolutionary Guards' deaths, which he described as a \"heavy loss\" for his country.\n\n\"The evil regime will be punished by the hands of our brave men. We will make them regret this crime and others like it,\" Ayatollah Khamenei said.\n\nIran's mission to the United Nations in New York also said the strike constituted a \"flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter, international law, and the foundational principle of the inviolability of diplomatic and consular premises\".\n\nOne of Ayatollah Khamenei's advisers, Ali Shamkhani, meanwhile claimed that US \"remains directly responsible, whether or not it was aware of the intention to carry out this attack\".\n\nUS National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson said it \"had no involvement in the strike\" and \"did not know about it ahead of time\".\n\nSyria's defence ministry said Israeli aircraft launched missiles at the Iranian consulate building, which was located next door to the Iranian embassy on a highway in the western Mezzeh district of Damascus, from the occupied Golan Heights on Monday afternoon.\n\nThe entire building was destroyed, \"killing and injuring everyone inside\", it added, without providing further details.\n\nIran's ambassador, Hossein Akbari, said the strike was carried out by Israeli F-35 fighter jets and \"targeted my place of residence and the consular section of the embassy, along with Iran's military attaches\".\n\nOn Monday evening, Iran's Revolutionary Guards put out a statement saying that seven of its officers were killed, including Brig-Gen Mohammad Reza Zahedi and Brig-Gen Mohammad Hadi Haji-Rahimi.\n\nIranian media said Zahedi, 63, was a senior figure in the Quds Force - the Revolutionary Guards' overseas operations arm - and served as commander in Lebanon and Syria between 2008 and 2016.

costs the group says would have to be passed on.\n\nThe cost of using carbon offsetting schemes to reach net zero will also drive up airlines' costs, the report adds.\n\nHeathrow Airport's director of sustainability Matthew Gorman - who chairs Sustainable Aviation - said this \"green premium\" will have \"some impact on future demand\" for air travel.\n\nBut he added that the industry could still \"grow significantly\" as most people were \"happy to pay a bit more to travel\".\n\nThe Sustainable Aviation group argues the move to greener travel presents a big opportunity for the UK, which has the world's third-largest global aviation network.\n\nUp to five new Saf production plants are planned for the UK, with the government investing in their development.\n\nHowever, the group said it was concerned investors would be lured to the US and the rest of Europe by \"significant\" tax incentives, and the UK risked missing out.\n\nIn response, it urged the government to introduce a mechanism to close the gap in price between Saf and traditional jet fuel.\n\nOn Monday, ministers and aviation chiefs will unveil an action plan for decarbonising the aviation industry at Farnborough Airport.\n\nTransport Secretary Mark Harper said: \"This government is a determined partner to the aviation industry - helping accelerate new technology and fuels, modernise their operations and work internationally to remove barriers to progress.\n\n\"Together, we can set aviation up for success, continue harnessing its huge social and economic benefits, and ensure it remains a core part of the UK's sustainable economic future.\"", "Footage released by US Coast Guard shows a crew member swimming through rough seas to rescue a dog trapped on a beach\n\nThe German Shepherd was injured after falling about 300ft (90m) down a cliff, and ended up trapped on an inaccessible beach in Oregon\u2019s Ecola State Park.\n\nThe dog was airlifted from the beach and returned to her owner, who after a visit to the emergency vet told the Coast Guard that she is \u201cdoing just fine.\"", "Strangulation is the second most common method of female murder in the UK\n\nPolice in Northern Ireland can now charge people with non-fatal strangulation.\n\nIt became a stand-alone offence in Northern Ireland under the Justice, Sexual Offences and Trafficking Victims Act 2022, and has now come into effect.\n\nStrangulation is the second most common method of female murder in the UK.\n\nWomen's Aid NI said the legal change would give prosecutors vital tools to deal with perpetrators.\n\nOver the last 10 years seven people (six women and one man) in Northern Ireland were strangled to death.\n\nNon-fatal strangulation is seen as a red flag for escalating violence in intimate partner relationships and a possible indicator for future risk of murder or attempted murder.\n\nOne victim of non-fatal strangulation spoke to the BBC anonymously about her experiences:\n\n\"There were several occasions of violence and a couple of strangulation, the reason I reported it to the police I suppose, was the the increase in the severity and the velocity of when I was strangled,\" she said.\n\n\"I totally blacked out, I lost consciousness, I lost control of my bowel and my bladder.\"\n\nShe said when she came to in the bed she had \"a fight or flight instinct\".\n\n\"That that was the final time, that was enough.\n\n\"While I was being strangled, the only thing that was really running through my head was my children finding me the next day and the panic of total loss of any oxygen.\n\n\"The realisation that you were slipping away and your last final thoughts are just your children finding you dead on the bed.\"\n\nShe said she then phoned the police.\n\n\"It doesn't take long for somebody to slip into unconsciousness and ultimately pass away.\n\n\"I'm really pleased that the legislation has come in here and the sentencing guidelines, you know, the impact of it, it takes into account the extent, the absolute terror, the fear that somebody that's experiencing that feels, and also takes into account the impact that it can leave on your life.\n\n\"It was a demonstration of control.

But as a deal with ministers was reached in England this week, the BBC can now reveal details of the secret and unprecedented talks.\n\nOn cold, frosty mornings on nurses' picket lines the rhetoric was fiery and noisy. Striking nurses condemned the government for failing to open pay talks. Ministers criticised walkouts affecting patients.\n\nBut behind the scenes it was a very different story. Secret contacts were being made between the two sides.\n\nFrom early January there were confidential approaches from an unofficial source to the Royal College of Nurses (RCN), the nurses' union, about the possibility of talks beginning in England. This involved putting out feelers to see what might bring the nurses' union to the table.\n\nStrikes by nurses and other health unions - representing paramedics, midwives and other NHS staff - had been triggered when ministers insisted on sticking to the recommendations of the independent pay review body (PRB). It had proposed average increases of 4%.\n\nThe RCN's original demand for a wage rise of 5% above inflation - equivalent at one point to 19% - was unaffordable, ministers said.\n\nThe government is ultimately responsible for setting NHS pay in England, funded by the Department of Health and Social Care. NHS Employers are involved in detailed negotiations.\n\nBut now these secret contacts had been made, it was not obvious to the RCN how closely they were linked to Downing Street or other parts of Whitehall.\n\nThe approaches seemed highly unorthodox. Usually it would be obvious whether ministers or officials were making a proposal.\n\nBut all became clear on 21 February with a call from Downing Street to the Royal College of Nursing. There was an invitation to talks which would include the idea of a one-off payment for the current financial year, a key demand of the nurses. The public announcement came as a big surprise even to some civil servants.\n\nThe prime minister was signalling a change of tack. Previously there had been denials that any more money was available. In return for the invitation to talk the RCN had to agree to call off an escalated two-day strike in England affecting all care, including emergencies.\n\nThe Royal College of Nursing's Pat Cullen had a high profile in the media and seemingly high public support\n\nAnd so began the chain of events which led to last Thursday's pay offer to nurses, paramedics, midwives and other health staff in England.\n\nThere were shades of international diplomacy and intrigue in the negotiations. Back-channels and deniable contacts had steered a damaging dispute into calmer waters.\n\nThe stakes could not have been higher, as on the face of it the NHS strikes and widespread disruption had seemed destined to rumble on for months. But so far, these tentative talks were only with the RCN. The other health unions, representing paramedics and a range of health staff, were irritated. They were not invited to the table.\n\nIt seemed that the government was deliberately focusing on the nurses' union because of what seemed to be rising public support. RCN's general secretary Pat Cullen had a high profile in the media.\n\nThe RCN discussions with ministers remained shrouded in secrecy. Early encounters took place at an undisclosed location to avoid the media.\n\nBut that changed on 2 March when the other unions were invited to join the talks. Assurances were given that more money was available but the unions had to agree to keep the process confidential.\n\nThe result was an intensive series of meetings at the Department of Health and Social Care in Victoria Street, close to Westminster Abbey.\n\nThey took place on the ninth floor in offices which have traditionally been occupied by ministers. Health Secretary Steve Barclay had chosen to move down one floor to an open plan office with civil servants.\n\nUnion officials were intrigued to note they were meeting in an office once occupied by Matt Hancock. It was the scene of his kiss with his then-aide Gina Coladangelo, caught on CCTV and the images leaked to a newspaper. They joked about the possible presence of cameras.\n\nThe six members of the NHS staff council, representing the main health unions, along with one other official, were used to talks with employers. Sara Gorton of Unison, who chairs the council, says of the unprecedented situation they were in: \"The process was unique in that the secretary of state was personally involved and negotiated directly with unions.\"\n\nWhat was also highly unusual was the presence of Treasury officials as well as negotiators from NHS Employers and health staff. It seemed they wanted to keep a close watch on money being offered.\n\nUnison's Sara Gorton said it was a unique situation for the health secretary to negotiate directly with unions\n\nOne union source said it became clear we were \"negotiating with people who weren't used to it\". Another added that they had \"never worked in this way before\".\n\nThere was a determination on the part of ministers to avoid leaks. Data sheets given to the negotiators had to be handed back at the end of each day. When the union team took the paperwork for their own private discussions they had to hand over their phones to prevent photos being taken. No paper was allowed to leave the building.\n\nPerhaps in a bid to demonstrate Whitehall austerity there was no regular supply of refreshments. One participant remembers \"coffee and an occasional biscuit\". Another said they decided to bring in their own glasses for water.\n\nFor lunch they were taken down to the department's canteen, escorted at all times around the building. Occasionally they nipped out for fresh air and a quick visit to a local sushi bar.\n\nThe days were long with formal talks in full sessions interspersed with negotiating teams retreating to smaller offices. Sometimes they ran on beyond midnight. They knew the outcome of their work would be vitally important for the whole NHS in England.\n\nSteve Barclay was present for much of the process, as was health minister Will Quince - though he had to take his leave one day because the King was visiting his constituency.\n\nAccording to one union source: \"Steve Barclay was constructive and there was not the heated atmosphere seen before Christmas.\"\n\nOne government source describes the secretary of state's style: \"What gets him going is seeing a problem through - like a maths problem - he doesn't make a big noise and gets his head down.\"\n\nHealth Secretary Steve Barclay was \"constructive\" in talks, a union source said\n\nThere were tensions at times, but no serious fallings out. Late on Wednesday evening a deal was done. Exhausted participants retired, relieved but knowing it had to be sold to members.\n\nRachel Harrison of the GMB reflects on the outcome: \"They were very long days locked on the ninth floor but it was what we asked for - we wanted to be invited in and they did.\"\n\nUnions had insisted before entering the talks that it had to be \"new money\" which funded any pay offer. Ministers, after the deal, said the funding would not come from NHS frontline budgets.\n\nBut there is still ambiguity about the source of the money, with government sources saying some would come from existing planned Department of Health and Social Care spending and the rest after negotiation with the Treasury.\n\nThe pay dispute started with ministers insisting that they would follow recommendations of the pay review body and not negotiate directly with unions. But it was face-to-face talks which broke the deadlock.\n\nThe deal - a one off payment and a 5% pay rise for the year starting in April - included an agreement to review the composition and remit of the PRB.\n\nYet this is not the end of the process. The dispute will only end once health union members give their approval - and that is far from certain.\n\nThere is a separate and ongoing doctors' pay row. There are different pay discussions in Scotland and Wales.\n\nBut strikes which have caused frustrating delays for patients and damaged staff morale have for now come to an end in England. As one union source reflects: \"What a shame it took so long.\"", "Jamie Garwood has been jailed for six years for killing his friend with a single punch\n\nA man who killed his friend with a \"mistaken\" punch has been jailed for six years.\n\nJamie Garwood, 33, knocked out Richard Dean Thompson, 44, before other members of their group stuck cigarette butts up his nose while he lay unconscious.\n\nMr Thompson died from a \"significant head injury\" in hospital six days later.\n\nGarwood was previously charged with murder but later pleaded guilty to manslaughter.\n\nCardiff Crown Court heard Garwood had spent the evening of 31 August 2022 at a property on Tewkesbury Walk in Newport, where Mr Thompson lived with his partner.\n\nJohn Hipkin KC, prosecuting, told the sentencing hearing on Thursday they had been part of a group of seven friends who were drinking heavily and taking drugs.\n\nDuring the evening, one of the group, Carlos Ross, began to throw small items at Mr Thompson.\n\nMr Hipkin said: \"Mr Thompson reacted by throwing a small tin which struck the defendant on the head, causing a small lump.\n\n\"The defendant threw a left-handed punch which struck [Mr Thompson] on the chin.\"\n\nMr Thompson fell to the ground, with a sound described as \"sickening\" by one witness, and was rendered \"unconscious for several minutes\".\n\nGarwood went to his aid, but throughout the evening his victim's condition deteriorated.\n\nOther members of the group, but not Garwood, stuck cigarette butts up his nose as he lay unconscious on the sofa, the court was told.\n\nAn ambulance was called by Mr Thompson's partner about two hours later, which arrived about 00:26 GMT - by which time Garwood had left the property.\n\nRichard Thompson was found unresponsive at his home on Tewkesbury Walk, Newport\n\nMr Thompson died from a \"significant head injury\" on 6 September at University Hospital Wales, Cardiff, and a post-mortem found he had sustained fractures to both sides of his head.\n\nMr Hipkin said Garwood - who had 44 previous court appearances for 79 offences including battery and assault - would have known that his friend was vulnerable.\n\nHe said Mr Thompson's home was being used for drug dealing by others at the time.\n\nIn a victim impact statement, Mr Thompson's brother Michael described him as \"a bubbling, funny person\" who was \"well known in the area and really popular\".\n\nDavid Elias, KC, defending, said the punch was \"mistaken\" in that it was \"a reaction to an item thrown by somebody else\" and \"lacked premeditation\".\n\n\"It is clear that the defendant is extremely remorseful,\" he said.\n\n\"He badly regrets the tragic consequences of his unlawful actions and he will have to live with that.\"\n\nOn Garwood's decision not to call an ambulance before he left the property, Mr Elias said: \"It seemed for a while that the defendant was going to be OK.\"\n\nShe said Garwood was an \"impulsive individual with little or no regard for the consequences of [his] actions\".\n\nGarwood, from Newport, was sentenced to six years in custody, of which he will have to spend at least four in prison. He will also serve four years on license upon release.", "Mortgage interest rates have risen sharply over the past six months after years of historic lows.\n\nAs higher interest rates will mean higher mortgage payments, experts say more people are at risk of falling into debt or losing their homes.\n\nTry our calculator below to see how your fixed rate mortgage might be affected as borrowing becomes more expensive.\n\nA modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive.

With more than 40% of the vote, New Democracy won all 50.\n\nMr Mitsotakis said he could not promise miracles, but that New Democracy had \"high goals\" to transform Greece with a better public health service and education.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras's centre-left Syriza had been soundly defeated in the first election and lost further ground in the second, with less than 18% of the vote. He dampened speculation that he would resign, saying that was a decision for his party members.\n\nOne of the big stories of the election was the success of a newly created far-right Spartans party, which won almost 4.7% of the vote, crossing the 3% threshold to enter parliament.\n\nThe Spartans only emerged as a political force this month when the Supreme Court banned another far-right party, the Greeks, and its jailed founder, Ilias Kasidiaris, threw his weight behind the Spartans.\n\nKasidiaris had been the spokesman for neo-Nazi party Golden Dawn, which was banned as a criminal organisation and its leaders given long prison terms.\n\nTogether with nationalist Greek Solution and ultra-conservative Niki (Victory), the three hard-right parties won close to 13% of the vote and 34 seats.\n\nThe victory secured by Kyriakos Mitsotakis, 55, over Alexis Tsipras's Syriza is a rarity in Greek politics, as few parties increase their share after a first term in office.\n\nHe also succeeded in attracting more young voters than his rival.\n\nAlexis Tsipras said his future as leader was in the hands of party members\n\nHis party was helped by the fragmentation of the left-wing vote; with Socialist PASOK set for more than 11% and the Communist KKE on around 7%.\n\nTurnout slumped eight points from the first vote to less than 53%.\n\nThe conservative leader has formed a reputation as a Teflon-coated leader, fending off a series of damaging crises in the past year, including a rail disaster and a wire-tapping scandal that brought down the intelligence chief and his own nephew, who worked as the prime minister's chief of staff.\n\nGreece was being led by a caretaker government when the migrant boat sank off the south-west coast in the early hours of 14 June.\n\nSince the migrant crisis, the views of most Greek voters have shifted in favour of stricter, more conservative policies, says Panos Koliastasis, assistant professor of politics at the University of Peloponnese.\n\n\"The reason is rooted in the 2020 migration crisis on the Evros [river], when Turkey tried to push thousands of migrants into Greek territory and the Mitsotakis government acted swiftly.

He managed to slash the ball through the off side, although was fortunate to fend the short ball three times into empty spaces.\n\nWhen Brook top-edged a bouncer, Australia still had a sniff but Wood, who took seven wickets in the match bowling at extreme pace, hooked Cummins over fine leg en route to 16 not out.\n\nIt was fitting, however, that Woakes, who also contributed a crucial six wickets, hit the winning runs after 15 months out of the side.\n\nStarc almost wins it for Australia\n\nAfter starting on 27-0, England had added 15 runs relatively calmly amid the tension, before Ben Duckett was pinned lbw by Starc's left-arm pace for 23.\n\nThe hosts promoted Moeen Ali in Brook's place but he only made five before a Starc inswinger crashed into his leg stump.\n\nZak Crawley batted well for 44 but, in a dismissal that sums up his Test career, edged a big drive to Mitchell Marsh through to the wicketkeeper a ball after hitting the same shot through the covers.\n\nRoot attempted to pull a wayward ball from Cummins and gloved it down the leg side.\n\nStarc, though, was the major threat and was rewarded by having Stokes taken down the leg side before Bairstow's wild swish.\n\nAustralia missed the control of spinner Nathan Lyon, ruled out of the series with a calf injury last week, but have more than a week to regroup before seeking a series-clinching victory again.\n\nEngland batter Harry Brook on Test Match Special: \"I don't think I can quite believe it yet, to do it here in front of my home crowd.\n\n\"It's a phenomenal win and sets up the rest of the series.\"\n\nFormer England captain Michael Vaughan: \"Fantastic.

turning in Luke Shaw's cross at the far post after 29 minutes - the floodgates opened.\n\nSaka added the second from Kyle Walker's pass nine minutes later and Marcus Rashford scored a third on the stroke of half-time after unselfish work by Jordan Henderson.\n\nThe highlight of this one-sided affair came two minutes after half-time when Saka controlled a perfect long pass by Trent Alexander-Arnold before sending a thunderous left-foot finish high past keeper Stole Dimitrievski.\n\nSaka completed his landmark hat-trick after racing clear on to Kane's pass, prompting Southgate to make a host of changes which allowed substitute Kalvin Phillips to get in the act with a simple tap-in to make it six.\n\nKane scored his second from the spot with 17 minutes left after John Stones had been fouled as England went on a goal rampage to record their biggest win since the 10-0 victory over San Marino in November 2021, and inflict North Macedonia's heaviest defeat.\n\u2022 None Can you name these England hat-trick heroes?\n\nUnstoppable England on course for Germany\n\nEngland could not have done a more convincing job of plotting their route to Euro 2024 with maximum points and their most testing assignment out of the way with victory over Italy in Naples.\n\nThis is a group England have to qualify from -

But I didn't see it as rape or sexual assault because this was 10 years ago.\"\n\nShe says it wasn't until about six years later when she described the alleged incident to her friends that she began to think she had been sexually assaulted.\n\nThree people who know Evie - and say they remember her describing what had happened - have told her lawyers they are prepared to give evidence in court to that effect.\n\nShe says she wants to share her experience to raise awareness about Mr Tate and get justice.\n\n\"Hopefully it can teach women what [consent] looks like and encourage more women to come forward with stories,\" she added.\n\nEvie is the latest British woman to join a planned lawsuit against Mr Tate.

The pair were later moved from custody to house arrest following a ruling by a Romanian judge.\n\nProsecutors are investigating the brothers for crimes of suspected human trafficking, rape and forming a criminal gang to sexually exploit women.

Any money not spent each academic year is returned to the Treasury.\n\nCharles Barnett, assistant head teacher at Wensleydale School and Sixth Form, welcomed the initial idea but said it took \"a very short amount of time to realise it wouldn't work effectively for us\".\n\n\"Both cost versus impact, they just didn't add up for us,\" he said. \"And then we couldn't reach enough students with what they were offering in the ways that they were offering it, and there simply wasn't the choice for us as a small rural school to tap into that offer.\"\n\nThe latest Department for Education (DfE) data estimates that 66% of schools in England have participated in the NTP this academic year, as of January.\n\nLondon has the highest rates of participation, at 73%. The lowest is seen in the North East, at 62%.\n\nIn the 21-22 academic year, 87% of schools in England used the scheme.\n\nEllen Widdup from Woodbridge has three children, aged 7, 13 and 15. She told BBC Radio Suffolk that as a single parent, she was working full time throughout the pandemic, making home schooling impossible. Ellen said her children definitely fell behind.\n\n\"I think that this offer from the government was brilliant in terms of helping children get back on track,\" she said. \"I just think it's awful that all that money is now going back to the government when it could've been spent.\"\n\nDr Rebecca Montacute, head of research and policy at education charity Sutton Trust, said participation had been higher in cities where there were already \"a lot more agencies operating or charities that were trying to get tutoring to disadvantaged students\".\n\nYour device may not support this visualisation\n\nThe NTP covered 75% of costs for school-led tutoring in the 21-22 academic year. This year, it provides 60%. In September, it is planned to drop to 25% for the 2023-24 academic year.\n\nDr Montacute said reducing the subsidy could mean schools either \"won't want to or won't be able to\" use the programme.\n\nSteve Haines, Director of Public Affairs at youth charity Impetus, said evidence shows tutoring can help pupils make accelerated progress, but \"the NTP will only work if schools are able to use it\".\n\nHe added pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds were less likely \"to pass their GCSE English and maths exams, and we are concerned that unless the government makes the changes necessary for more schools to use the scheme, they will fall behind even further\".\n\nThe government had initially aimed for 65% of NTP tuition go to disadvantaged pupils. During the 21-22 academic year, 47% of the tuition did.\n\nShe said: \"The government failed children throughout the pandemic and is failing to prioritise their futures now, with the result that the learning gap between children on free school meals and those not has widened to the biggest gap for a decade.\"\n\nLib Dem education spokesperson Munira Wilson MP said: \"How can the government claim to be prioritising levelling up while leaving the most disadvantaged children behind?\"\n\nWhen the NTP started in 2020, schools could either work with an external organisation that could provide tutors, or employ an academic mentor who could provide intensive support.\n\nLast year, the DfE introduced a third option - letting schools use their own staff.\n\nFrom left to right, Ria, Owais and Zamzama at Kings Road Primary\n\n\"At the start it was ineffective,\" said Darren Morgan, head teacher of Manchester's Kings Road Primary. \"But, when the government moved to a more school-based approach, it was amazing.\"\n\nMr Morgan has been using the funding to run catch-up groups in maths and English during the holidays and after school.\n\nRia, Owais and Zamzama are in Year 6 at Kings Road Primary. They have been enjoying their tutoring sessions.\n\n\"I think it's changed my learning,\" said Ria. \"I used to get low scores but now I'm getting really high scores.\"\n\nZamzama said: \"Before sessions, I was feeling really nervous. I was like, 'what if I don't do all right or something like that?' But now I feel I've got confidence again.\"\n\nMr Morgan said his pupils had made lots of progress thanks to the NTP but he understands why others have not used it.\n\n\"I'm lucky because I'm part of a big school, so I have more of a budget,\" he said. \"But overnight, lots of schools fell into deficit, myself included. Heating bills were going up, everything was increasing. I can understand why it wasn't possible to access the programme.\"\n\nDespite being a fan of the scheme, Mr Morgan said it was unlikely he can afford to continue it. He said it would cost his school an extra \u00a335,000 from September when the subsidy falls to 25% - and he would rather drop the programme than make a staff member redundant.\n\nDr Montacute said it was understandable that not all the funds had been spent \"given the challenge of being able to scale up a programme like this in the pandemic\".\n\n\"Long term, the NTP should be seen as a core part of the fabric of the school system specifically to tackle the attainment gap between the poorest and the richest young people,\" she added.\n\nSchools Minister Nick Gibb said the programme had delivered tutoring at unprecedented scale and \"millions of children have benefited\".\n\n\"With exam season approaching, I hope that every eligible school will take advantage of the scheme this term to provide pupils who need additional help with one-to-one or small group tuition.\"", "Party leaders are making their final pitch to voters on the last day of campaigning for local elections across England.\n\nThey are set to visit battleground areas before polls open on Thursday to elect around 8,000 councillors and four local mayors.\n\nThe polls will decide who will run services in 230 local councils.\n\nThey are also being closely watched as a key test of public opinion before the general election expected next year.\n\nOpposition parties have sought to attack the Conservatives' record on crime, as well as running key services such as the NHS.\n\nCampaigning, taking place against a backdrop of stubbornly high inflation, has also been dominated by the cost of living.\n\nLeaders from the main parties are all making campaign stops later, following the last session of Prime Minister's Questions before polls open.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Rishi Sunak said \"good councillors will lose tomorrow\" because of the turbulence in the Conservative Party over the last year.\n\nEarlier in the day during a visit to Buckinghamshire, the prime minister said: \"We are concentrating on delivering on people's priorities.\n\n\"Nationally, I'm focused on my five priorities - that's halving inflation, growing the economy, reducing debt, cutting waiting lists and stopping the boats.\n\n\"We're going to keep delivering for people.

Between 2014 and 2020, he gave \u00a3633,800 according to Electoral Commission records.\n\nIn February 2022, the Sunday Times reported he was a member of a group of major donors who had access to senior party members, including to then prime minister, Boris Johnson.\n\nMr Marandi is well known for his philanthropic work and support of the arts\n\nMr Marandi was described in court as a \"highly successful international businessman\" with a broad portfolio of business interests in the UK and abroad.\n\nHe owns the iconic design brand, The Conran Shop, a stake in Anya Hindmarch Ltd, the luxury handbag firm, and an exclusive private members' club and hotel in Oxfordshire.\n\nAlong with his wife, he heads the Marandi Foundation, which funds the Prince and Princess of Wales's charity.\n\nIn 2021, Mr Marandi became a special adviser to homelessness charity Centrepoint, providing guidance on how it could expand its work with disadvantaged young people.\n\nNone of Mr Marandi's UK businesses or these organisations form any part of the NCA's investigation, which looked at earlier events.\n\nThe probe began in 2017, after investigative journalists revealed an enormous money-laundering scheme, which became known as the \"Azerbaijani Laundromat\".\n\nThe Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) revealed how $2.9bn (\u00a32.3bn) of dirty money - cash stolen from Azerbaijan's people and economy - had been spirited away by members of the country's elite. It was largely for their own benefit, but also to bribe European politicians.\n\nPaul Radu, the OCCRP's co-founder, said the Laundromat scheme was one of the most significant examples of post-Soviet looting.\n\n\"The Azerbaijani Laundromat brought a lot of damage on many levels to Azerbaijan itself, to the European Union, to the US, and other parts of the world,\" he said.\n\n\"Small businesses lost a lot of money - they had deposits with a bank that was at the centre of the Laundromat.\"\n\nThose revelations prompted the NCA to investigate the Feyziyev family's finances in the UK - leading to its application, in 2021, to seize some of their UK cash - and the disclosure in court of the link to Mr Marandi.\n\nAccording to documents from the NCA's case at Westminster Magistrates' Court, the suspect money that made its way to the Feyziyev family accounts in London had originated in bank accounts belonging to a company with neither employees, nor traceable records of its activities.\n\nFake companies: NCA says money trail began with cash moved into bogus firm in Baku\n\nBased in Baku, Azerbaijan's capital, Baktelekom looked like a state-owned firm that has an almost identical name.\n\nDistrict Judge John Zani found that \"substantial funds from this criminal enterprise\" were then moved into two bank accounts in the Baltics belonging to Glasgow-registered shell companies.\n\nSome of the cash was then moved onwards to accounts linked to Javanshir Feyziyev and Javad Marandi, according to the NCA.\n\nA series of firms, sharing the name Avromed, were \"central\" to the transfer of this money.\n\nOne of them had been set up in the Seychelles in 2005, with Mr Marandi being its beneficiary.\n\nCourt papers show the Avromed Seychelles company received large sums, as shown in the graphic below.\n\nMoney flowed into the company from other sources. In total, investigators say it paid out:\n\nRuling on the NCA's application to seize cash from the Feyziyev family, the judge concluded: \"I am satisfied that there is overwhelming evidence that the invoices and contracts purporting to support legitimate (and very substantial) business transactions between Baktelekom, Hilux and Polux were entirely fictitious.\"\n\nThey were produced in order to allow \"very significant sums into and out of their accounts so as to mask the underlying money-laundering activities of those orchestrating the accounts\".\n\nSeychelles: Company registered here, with a bank account in the Baltic, received cash from Glasgow-registered firms\n\nThe National Crime Agency told the court it would \"neither confirm nor deny\" whether there was an active investigation into Mr Marandi's finances - but the well-known businessman has adamantly denied any involvement in wrongdoing.\n\nHis lawyers told the court that between 2012-2017, tight currency controls in Azerbaijan meant he had to use exchange houses in Latvia and Estonia to transfer legitimately-owned dividends from Avromed and other businesses.\n\n\"The funds were lawfully earned, and lawfully transferred, and there is no question of money laundering,\" they said.\n\nLegal battle: Began in October 2021 at outset of major NCA case\n\nWhen the NCA's case against the Feyziyev family first went to court, Mr Marandi's lawyers argued that revealing his identity would breach his privacy and cause \"profound and irremediable\" damage to his reputation - not least because no law enforcement body had interviewed or approached him regarding the case.\n\nAfter the court ruled the NCA could seize millions from the Feyziyev family's British bank accounts, the BBC and London Evening Standard argued it was in the public interest to disclose that some of Mr Marandi's overseas interests had been part of the case.\n\nJudge Zani ruled, in May 2022, that Mr Marandi - who was referred to as MNL - could be named under principles of open justice, saying he had been a \"person of importance to the main proceedings\".\n\nThat ruling triggered more than a year of further challenges by Mr Marandi.\n\nHis lawyers succeeded in getting a costly High Court review of Judge Zani's ruling. By this stage, the London Evening Standard had dropped out of the challenge.\n\nLast month, two of the country's most experienced judges ruled the media could name Mr Marandi.\n\nThey concluded that open justice was a fundamental principle and that anonymity should only be allowed in exceptional circumstances.\n\nMr Justice Mostyn said: \"My only surprise is that the anonymity order was granted in the first place. For reasons of procedural unfairness as well as a distinct lack of merit, it should never have been granted.\"\n\nSpeaking after losing the case, a spokesman for Mr Marandi said that he not been the subject of the claim against the Feyziyev family, nor a witness.\n\n\"It is therefore unjust to be named, without having had the fundamental right to rebut these false findings.\"\n\nIn its decision on Monday evening to allow the BBC to report the story, the Court of Appeal said: \"[Mr Marandi] may not have been a party to or a witness in the forfeiture proceedings, but that did not mean that he had no fair opportunity to address the allegations made against him.\n\n\"He could have refuted them in detail when he put in his evidence in support of his claim for anonymity. Instead, he chose to rest on a bare denial of wrongdoing.\n\n\"Moreover in this case, as the [High Court] held, the forfeiture judgment contained no finding that [the applicant] was guilty of an offence.\"\n\nDuncan Hames, director of policy at the anti-corruption research group Transparency International UK, said the Conservative Party had questions to answer.\n\n\"This is a political bombshell,\" he said. \"We've learned today that someone who's given hundreds of thousands to a British political party has, in the words of the judge, been a person of importance in proceedings before the court about a major money-laundering enterprise.\n\n\"That should be a concern, not just to people who are worried about where that money came from, but about what it says about how easily money can reach political parties without [them] doing proper checks on on its origins.\"\n\nThe former Liberal Democrat MP added: \"It's not good enough just to check whether someone is on the electoral roll. Our political parties need to be much more careful about who they take money from. \"\n\nA Conservative Party spokesperson said in a statement the party only accepts donations from \"permissible sources, namely individuals registered on the UK's electoral roll or UK registered companies\".\n\n\"Donations are properly and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission, openly published by them, and comply fully with the law.\"\n\nIn Parliament, SNP MP Alison Thewliss was granted the urgent question on the implications of the NCA's investigation. She asked Home Office minister Chris Philp to confirm whether Mr Marandi had meetings with ministers or received any government contracts.\n\nLabour MP Margaret Hodge - the former chair of Parliament's Public Accounts Committee - said: \"We should take these allegations very seriously. If true, dirty money has well and truly crept into our politics\u2026 Will the government bring forward regulations requiring all parties to do due diligence and checks on the source of all political donations\".\n\nMr Philp said the government was \"committed to making sure the UK does not have dirty money\", and stressed electoral law set out a \"stringent regime of donations' controls\".\n\nHe said the government \"does not and cannot comment on investigations being undertaken by law enforcement operations\".\n\nBBC News has contacted the Royal Foundation and Centrepoint for comment.\n\nIn an earlier version of this story the BBC reported Mr Marandi's Conservative Party donations as \u00a3756,300.

And basically those drivers are sitting ducks.\"\n\nThe RAC meanwhile said existing smart motorways - which make up about 10% of England's motorway network - now had to be made \"as safe as possible\".\n\n\"The possibility of converting all lane running stretches to the 'dynamic hard shoulder' configuration, where the hard shoulder is open and closed depending on the levels of traffic, could be one option the government considers,\" said RAC road safety spokesman Simon Williams.\n\nUnder the government's plan, existing smart motorways will remain and undergo a previously announced safety refit to create 150 more emergency stopping places and improved technology.\n\nConservative Party Chairman Greg Hands told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg programme: \"We will not approve any new smart motorways, clearly as a result of public concern and safety concern. And we're going to keep a close eye on the situation with the existing smart motorways.\"\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak - who pledged to ban smart motorways during his leadership campaign - said \"all drivers deserve to have confidence in the roads they use to get around the country\".\n\nThe Department for Transport said the new schemes would have cost more than \u00a31bn, and cancelling them would allow time to track public trust in smart motorways over a longer period.\n\nThere are three main types:\n\nAll three models use overhead gantries to direct drivers. Variable speed limits are introduced to control traffic flow when there is congestion, or if there is a hazard ahead. These limits are controlled by speed cameras.\n\nSeven of the 14 projects that have been cancelled were going to involve converting stretches of motorway into \"all-lane running\" roads where the hard shoulder is permanently removed.\n\nThey will now remain as \"dynamic\" smart motorways where the hard shoulder can be opened as an extra lane during busy times.\n\nThe construction of two stretches of smart motorway from junctions six to eight on the M56, and from 21a to 26 on the M6, will continue as they are already more than three quarters complete.\n\nSmart motorways were developed to create more capacity and cut congestion on roads, without spending money and causing disruption building news ones.\n\nHowever, they have been criticised by MPs and road safety bodies, including the AA and RAC.\n\nClaire Mercer, whose husband died on a smart motorway in South Yorkshire in 2019, welcomed the move but pledged to continue campaigning for the hard shoulder to return on every road.\n\nMrs Mercer said: \"I'm particularly happy that it's been confirmed that the routes that are in planning, in progress, have also been cancelled. I didn't think they'd do that.\n\n\"So it's good news, but obviously it's the existing ones that are killing us.

in the end, this was not necessary.\n\nA UK government spokesperson said: \"We spent billions to protect families when prices rose over winter covering nearly half a typical household's energy bill, with them set to fall by around \u00a3430 on average from this month.\"\n\nDomestic gas and electricity bills in the UK fell at the weekend after a change to the energy price cap came into force, and a further, smaller fall is expected this winter.\n\nHowever, with the annual energy bill of a typical household set to be about \u00a32,000, costs are still much higher than the pre-pandemic norm.\n\nLast week the head of Centrica, which owns British Gas, warned energy bills were likely to stay high for the foreseeable future.\n\nRussia's war in Ukraine led to a \"gold rush\" of new fossil fuel exploration, and the UK defied climate warnings by issuing a new licensing round for North Sea oil and gas.\n\nMore than 100 applications have been submitted to drill for new oil and gas in the North Sea.\n\nThis was at odds with international climate scientists who say fossil fuel projects should be closed down, not expanded.\n\nThey say there can be no new projects if there is to be a chance of keeping global temperature rises under 1.5C.\n\nMr Birol said \"if the world is serious\" about the \"climate cause\" then \"we have to reduce the use of oil and gas significantly in the next years to come\".\n\nIf we can reduce consumption, existing oil and gas fields will be enough to meet declining demand, he added.\n\nHe said he has discussions with the chief executives of UK oil companies.\n\nMr Birol said he has \"no problem\" with oil firms making profits, but if they say: \"I am going to increase my production by four million barrels per day, and my company's strategy is in line with the Paris Climate Agreement - it doesn't work, there is a problem here.\"\n\nThe Rosebank field in the North Sea, which has the potential to produce 500 million barrels of oil, could be approved by the government within weeks.\n\nThe UK government said it was \"committed to reaching net zero by 2050 and have already come a long way to meet that target, cutting emissions faster than any other G7 country while keeping the economy growing and with low-carbon sources like renewables and nuclear providing half of the UK's electricity generation\".\n\nBut a spokesperson added \"the transition to cleaner energy cannot happen overnight and we will continue to need oil and gas over the coming decades, as recognised by the independent Climate Change Committee\".\n\nEmma Pinchbeck, the chief executive of Energy UK, which represents British energy companies, told the BBC's Today programme that the long-term solution to high bills \"is to invest in renewables and energy efficiency to make sure that we're not reliant on volatile international gas\".\n\n\"We expect that investment in more infrastructure in renewables and energy efficiency and alternative technologies to deliver cheaper bills in the long run... and that's why it's so important that we move quickly, particularly with increased international competition for these technologies.\"\n\nHere are some energy saving ideas from environmental scientist Angela Terry, who set up One Home, a social enterprise that shares green, money-saving tips:\n\nAre you struggling to pay your energy bills?

Some of them carry rocks or small home-made bombs to hurl at passing Israeli vehicles. In sporadic bursts, gunfire and explosions echo in the refugee camp, which is on high ground above the town centre. Israeli drones buzz constantly overhead.\n\nAt times, armed Palestinians emerge from the tyre smoke to fire at the Israelis.\n\nViolence between Palestinians and Israelis has become almost a daily event this year. When blood is spilt there is often a dynamic of retaliation, that includes Palestinian armed groups, Jews who live in settlements in the occupied West Bank that are illegal under international law, and the Israeli army. The Israelis said they moved in on the Jenin camp because more than 50 relatively recent attacks were launched from there.\n\nBut the roots of violence, despair and hatred go much deeper than the latest violent confrontations. They thrive in the poison generated by a conflict over possession of the land that started more than a century ago. For a while, back in the 1990s, there were hopes that peace might come if an independent Palestinian state could be established alongside Israel, the so-called two-state solution. The attempt failed.\n\nPowerful Western countries, including the US, European Union members and the UK still insist that two states are the only possible solution. Their words are empty slogans. The last American attempt to try to make the idea work collapsed in 2014.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThe Israeli operation here in Jenin was in the air for months. Despite regular smaller Israeli raids, Palestinian armed groups had become strong enough and united enough to control the Jenin refugee camp. They seemed to be getting stronger.\n\nA fortnight ago they blew up an Israeli jeep and fought hard to repel an Israeli raid, in which the Palestinian dead included a 15-year-old girl. The next day four Israelis were killed by two Palestinians who burst into a restaurant not far from Jenin, where they were eating. The Israeli army protected Jewish settlers who rampaged through Palestinian villages burning cars and houses, in a series of reprisals.\n\nIt was a matter of time before the Israeli army moved against the Palestinians who controlled Jenin refugee camp. It says it is carrying out a systematic operation to track down and destroy weapons and explosives.\n\nFury and frustration rage through young Palestinian men who have gathered in angry knots at road junctions in the town and outside a hospital on the edge of the Jenin refugee camp. Their barricades of burning tyres leave behind black circles and piles of burnt rubber and twisted wire.\n\nThe Israeli army is releasing updates on explosives discovered and neutralised in the two days it has been in the camp, along with what it calls terrorist command centres. The business-like tone of the military communiques contrasts with the statements made by members of the Israeli cabinet who oppose any kind of Palestinian self-determination.\n\nAfter a Palestinian was shot dead in Tel Aviv by a passer-by, after he had rammed his car into a crowd of Israelis, public security minister Itamar Ben Gvir issued a statement saying Israel's war in Jenin was also their war in Tel Aviv. Every Jew, he said, was a target for murderers.\n\nMr Ben Gvir and his political allies have been pressing for a punitive sweep through the West Bank to deal with their enemies. The Israeli army is more cautious, as it is more worried about the risks and consequences of escalation. All the indications are the Israeli army would like to restrict its operation to the Jenin refugee camp, declare victory soon and order its soldiers back to their bases.\n\nIsraeli victories after an operation like this never last long. Palestinian armed groups restock their armouries and the cycle begins again. Plans to expand settlements for Jews on occupied land that Palestinians want for a state, sometimes called a Zionist response by Israeli politicians, also raise the temperature.\n\nMany Palestinians are disenchanted with their own ageing and ineffective leaders in the Palestinian Authority, a legacy of the 1990s peace process that was supposed back then to build the institutions necessary to create their own state.\n\nWhen this operation ends, on past form both sides will claim victory. Then the current realities of this long conflict will reassert themselves. Anger, despair and poverty will reinforce the culture of resistance that has embedded itself in Palestinian society, especially here in Jenin and in Nablus. And Israel's right-wing, hyper-nationalist government, as long as it lasts, will try to match its rhetoric with action.\n\nThe real danger is that Israelis and Palestinians are sliding into an even more violent phase of their long conflict.", "Rachel Crooks, Jessica Leeds and Samantha Holvey at a press conference after accusing Trump of sexual harassment in 2017 Image caption: Rachel Crooks, Jessica Leeds and Samantha Holvey at a press conference after accusing Trump of sexual harassment in 2017\n\nCarroll is not the only woman to accuse Trump of sexual misconduct.\n\nOver two dozen women have come forward with accusations against Trump in recent years.\n\nThe alleged incidents stretched as far back as the 1970s, with accusations that Trump reached up their skirts, touched, or kissed them without their consent.\n\nAs he did with Carroll, Trump has denied all the allegations, and has claimed women who spoke out were lying or politically motivated.\n\nSome of these women told their stories during the 2016 election.

Energy and communications were disrupted, while food and water were becoming \"increasingly scarce\", he said.\n\nDefence sources told the BBC any Sudan evacuation would be more difficult than the August 2021 Afghanistan airlift, due to fighting around the capital and an absence of troops already on the ground.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nKhartoum is \"more dynamic, more dangerous\" than Kabul was at the time, they said, with armed clashes happening \"in the neighbourhoods where western nationals are most heavily concentrated\".\n\nCommenting on the advice being issued to people trapped in Sudan, the defence source added: \"If you tell people to stay at home they may be less likely to get shot.

Then they get closer to food and water but they might be at increased risk.\"\n\nResponding to questions from MPs, Mr Mitchell also confirmed that neither the UK's ambassador to Sudan nor the deputy head of mission were in the country when the conflict began.\n\nA team of 200 officials is working around the clock in the Foreign Office to provide consular assistance to those who need it, and regular updates are being issued, he added.\n\nBritish doctor Iman Abu Gargar told the BBC she was able to leave with the French evacuation because Irish passport holders, including her son, were able to join.\n\nSpeaking from Djibouti, which lies to the east of Sudan, Dr Gargar said she felt left behind by the UK.

Some of them carry rocks or small home-made bombs to hurl at passing Israeli vehicles. In sporadic bursts, gunfire and explosions echo in the refugee camp, which is on high ground above the town centre. Israeli drones buzz constantly overhead.\n\nAt times, armed Palestinians emerge from the tyre smoke to fire at the Israelis.\n\nViolence between Palestinians and Israelis has become almost a daily event this year. When blood is spilt there is often a dynamic of retaliation, that includes Palestinian armed groups, Jews who live in settlements in the occupied West Bank that are illegal under international law, and the Israeli army. The Israelis said they moved in on the Jenin camp because more than 50 relatively recent attacks were launched from there.\n\nBut the roots of violence, despair and hatred go much deeper than the latest violent confrontations. They thrive in the poison generated by a conflict over possession of the land that started more than a century ago. For a while, back in the 1990s, there were hopes that peace might come if an independent Palestinian state could be established alongside Israel, the so-called two-state solution. The attempt failed.\n\nPowerful Western countries, including the US, European Union members and the UK still insist that two states are the only possible solution. Their words are empty slogans. The last American attempt to try to make the idea work collapsed in 2014.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThe Israeli operation here in Jenin was in the air for months. Despite regular smaller Israeli raids, Palestinian armed groups had become strong enough and united enough to control the Jenin refugee camp. They seemed to be getting stronger.\n\nA fortnight ago they blew up an Israeli jeep and fought hard to repel an Israeli raid, in which the Palestinian dead included a 15-year-old girl. The next day four Israelis were killed by two Palestinians who burst into a restaurant not far from Jenin, where they were eating. The Israeli army protected Jewish settlers who rampaged through Palestinian villages burning cars and houses, in a series of reprisals.\n\nIt was a matter of time before the Israeli army moved against the Palestinians who controlled Jenin refugee camp. It says it is carrying out a systematic operation to track down and destroy weapons and explosives.\n\nFury and frustration rage through young Palestinian men who have gathered in angry knots at road junctions in the town and outside a hospital on the edge of the Jenin refugee camp. Their barricades of burning tyres leave behind black circles and piles of burnt rubber and twisted wire.\n\nThe Israeli army is releasing updates on explosives discovered and neutralised in the two days it has been in the camp, along with what it calls terrorist command centres. The business-like tone of the military communiques contrasts with the statements made by members of the Israeli cabinet who oppose any kind of Palestinian self-determination.\n\nAfter a Palestinian was shot dead in Tel Aviv by a passer-by, after he had rammed his car into a crowd of Israelis, public security minister Itamar Ben Gvir issued a statement saying Israel's war in Jenin was also their war in Tel Aviv. Every Jew, he said, was a target for murderers.\n\nMr Ben Gvir and his political allies have been pressing for a punitive sweep through the West Bank to deal with their enemies. The Israeli army is more cautious, as it is more worried about the risks and consequences of escalation. All the indications are the Israeli army would like to restrict its operation to the Jenin refugee camp, declare victory soon and order its soldiers back to their bases.\n\nIsraeli victories after an operation like this never last long. Palestinian armed groups restock their armouries and the cycle begins again. Plans to expand settlements for Jews on occupied land that Palestinians want for a state, sometimes called a Zionist response by Israeli politicians, also raise the temperature.\n\nMany Palestinians are disenchanted with their own ageing and ineffective leaders in the Palestinian Authority, a legacy of the 1990s peace process that was supposed back then to build the institutions necessary to create their own state.\n\nWhen this operation ends, on past form both sides will claim victory. Then the current realities of this long conflict will reassert themselves. Anger, despair and poverty will reinforce the culture of resistance that has embedded itself in Palestinian society, especially here in Jenin and in Nablus. And Israel's right-wing, hyper-nationalist government, as long as it lasts, will try to match its rhetoric with action.\n\nThe real danger is that Israelis and Palestinians are sliding into an even more violent phase of their long conflict.", "Last updated on .From the section Formula 1\n\nRussian racing driver Nikita Mazepin has begun High Court action against Foreign Secretary James Cleverly to get British sanctions against him lifted.\n\nMazepin and his father Dmitry were sanctioned by the UK, Canada and European Union in March 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMazepin was also sacked by Formula 1 team Haas as a result of the invasion.\n\nNeither Mazepin nor his father were at the hearing.\n\nHis lawyer Rachel Scott said Mazepin wanted his challenge heard as a matter of \"urgency\" because of the need hold talks with prospective race teams for the 2024 season.\n\nMazepin and his father are subject to an assets freeze and travel ban as part of the sanctions, though lawyers representing the Foreign Office argued that Mazepin could still negotiate with Formula One teams with the sanctions in place.\n\nMazepin is also challenging EU and Canadian sanctions as part of his attempt to return to Formula One.\n\nIn September 2022, Mazepin had requested \"revocation of his designation\" - a lifting of the sanctions - but UK government ministers had decided to \"take no action\".\n\nIn a witness statement, he said that \"even if - or while - the Canadian sanctions remain in place, there is at least a prospect of me being able to enter into negotiations to return to Formula One if sanctions are lifted in both the EU and UK\".\n\nFollowing the invasion, Haas also terminated the contract of their title sponsor, the Russian chemicals company Uralkali.

It could lead to a further formal review.\n\nEarlier this month, Mr Barclay suggested that the case for new incinerators would be \"undermined\" by making progress on a government target to halve the waste which goes to them.\n\nA source from Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the environment secretary would not have any involvement in the work.\n\nThe order is set to expire on 24 May but could be withdrawn earlier.\n\nApplications for 10 incinerators across England are thought to be affected, but plants which dispose of clinical or hazardous waste are exempt from the pause.\n\nIn March, the BBC saw an internal legal note which had been compiled within government after consultation with Sir James Eadie KC, the First Treasury counsel.\n\nAt that point it is understood the government was privately exploring the consequences of pausing licences for up to a year.\n\nThe note said that that proposal raised \"serious concerns of perceived bias\" as it had come shortly after permission was granted by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (Desnez) for the Wisbech incinerator to be built.\n\nThe plant still needs a licence from the Environment Agency, a non-departmental public body, to go ahead.\n\nThe legal note advised that the proposed suspension would have been \"unlawful\" because \"the consultation undertaken\u2026was plainly inadequate\" and noted \"the context of the secretary of state's constituency interests\".\n\nThe waste incinerator could be built in an industrial part of Wisbech on the Cambridgeshire-Norfolk border\n\nIn an article written for this month's edition of a local Cambridgeshire magazine, \"Discovering Wisbech\", Mr Barclay wrote he was committed to \"doing everything possible to fight\" the new incinerator.\n\nHe described it as a \"massive blot on the landscape\" and said that he had already had conversations with Fenland District Council about supporting them in bringing forward a judicial review of the decision to grant planning consent.\n\nA spokesperson for Defra said the department was committed to reducing waste, improving recycling and meeting net zero targets for sending less waste for incineration.\n\n\"We must make sure we have the right waste management infrastructure to meet these goals, and are rightly considering the need for more waste incineration facilities.\"\n\nBut Labour's shadow environment secretary Steve Reed said there were \"serious concerns\" Mr Barclay abused his position to prop up his constituency decision.\n\n\"The British public deserve answers. Who did Barclay try to persuade, when, and which other ministers were involved,\" he said.\n\nMr Barclay told a committee of MPs in March that he had never \"made representations as secretary of state\" to the Environment Agency about the Wisbech project.\n\nHe also said that he had delegated the policy to another minister and apologised for not formally recusing himself earlier.\n\nProtesters opposed to the proposed site said it would cause pollution in the area", "Prince Charles (top right) and his sister Princess Anne pictured leaving Northern Ireland after their first visit in 1961\n\nKing Charles III was just 12 years old when he arrived in Northern Ireland for his first official visit.\n\nOn 8 August 1961, the young prince and his family sailed into Carrickfergus, County Antrim, on board a \"floating palace\" - the Royal Yacht Britannia.\n\nHe travelled with his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II, his late father the Duke of Edinburgh and his then 10-year-old sister, Princess Anne.\n\nIt was to be the first of 39 trips to Northern Ireland as heir to the throne.\n\nHis parents had arrived for a two-day tour, packed full of formal

little sister had afternoon tea at a County Down estate and enjoyed a picnic on a private island, where a hungry Labrador stole their bodyguard's lunch.\n\nThe 1961 papers were intrigued by the prince's daytrip to a County Down island\n\nTight security measures have been a feature of royal visits since the start of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, but back in 1961, the Royal Family's schedule could be publicised days in advance.\n\nThe Belfast Telegraph published an almost minute-by-minute guide of the Queen's itinerary, pointing out the best locations to see the monarch's motorcade.\n\nThere was great excitement ahead of what was her first visit for seven years, and only her third tour as reigning monarch.\n\nIn a rain-soaked Carrickfergus, an armada of little boats owned by well-wishers greeted the Royal Family, while hundreds of cheering spectators lined the town's harbour.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II disembarks from the royal barge at Carrickfergus in 1961\n\nThe Queen and the Duke disembarked for a tour of Carrickfergus Castle, but unlike their parents' itinerary, the younger royals' travel plans were not pre-announced.\n\n\"The children's destination had been kept secret at the Queen's wishes, right until the last minute,\" the Belfast Telegraph reported.\n\nPrince Charles and his sister were brought ashore at Belfast and driven to Rademon Estate on the outskirts of Crossgar, County Down.\n\nThe 500-acre estate was then home to the aptly-named King family who were long-standing friends of the Windsors.\n\nJames Osborne King was a prominent estate agent and his wife, the Hon Elizabeth Patricia King (n\u00e9e White), was a childhood friend of Queen Elizabeth.\n\nThe Queen was also godmother to the couple's eldest child, 14-year-old Elizabeth Lavinia Sarah King.\n\nThe late Queen, then known as Princess Elizabeth, attended baby Lavinia King's baptism in Comber, County Down, in 1946\n\nMrs King was descended from the Spencer family, sharing ancestry with Lady Diana Spencer - the future first wife of the young Prince Charles.\n\nShe was a first cousin of Lady Diana's father, the 8th Earl Spencer, but her family link to the Windsors goes back further.\n\nMrs King's mother, Lavinia Emily White (n\u00e9e Spencer), had been a lady-in-waiting to the late Queen Mother while she was the Duchess of York.\n\nAt Rademon, Prince Charles and his sister were joined by their parents for afternoon tea hosted by the Kings.\n\nThe following day, the Queen visited Belfast City Hall and Harland and Wolff shipyard but, reportedly, she did not believe her children would enjoy either event.\n\nSo instead, it was arranged that the prince and princess would go for a picnic on Strangford Lough, accompanied by Mr and Mrs King's three young children.\n\nSir Richard Pim, a retired inspector-general of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, was entrusted with sailing the children to Pawle Island - a small, uninhabited land mass off the lough's western shore.\n\nFew people spotted the heir to the throne tucking into his packed lunch, but in the days that followed, \"scores of holidaymakers\" flocked to the island to explore the royal picnic spot.\n\nPawle Island, pictured here in June 2020, briefly became a tourist attraction after the 1961 royal picnic\n\nTwenty years later, ahead of Prince Charles's wedding to Lady Diana, Sir Richard regaled the Belfast Telegraph with his memories of the Pawle Island picnic.\n\n\"I had brought Bracken, my Labrador, with me and the prince had his detective with him, a big fellow who must have been all of 20 stones,\" Sir Richard recalled.\n\n\"The detective decided he would go and find himself some beer and he went off, leaving his lunch on the stone where he had been sitting.\n\n\"Bracken, as soon as his back was turned, promptly went across and ate it.\"\n\nSir Richard said the young prince found the case of the stolen sandwiches \"very funny\" and the pair laughed about it when they met again in later life.\n\nThe 1961 visit was the King's only childhood trip to Northern Ireland and 18 years passed before he came back for a second tour.\n\nDuring that period, the security situation in Northern Ireland deteriorated markedly.\n\nThe Troubles began in the late 1960s and Prince Charles was 31 years old by the time he returned to Northern Ireland in 1979.\n\nPrince Charles's second visit to Northern Ireland in 1979 had a very different tone to his first\n\nHe arrived three months after the IRA killed 18 soldiers in a bomb attack at Narrow Water, County Down.\n\nThe paramilitary group also killed his own great uncle and beloved mentor, Lord Mountbatten, in a bombing in the Republic of Ireland on the same day.\n\nPrince Charles spent his 1979 visit meeting soldiers at various barracks close to the border, which had been the target of regular IRA attacks.\n\nThe peace process began to take hold in the 1990s and Prince Charles soon became a regular guest of Northern Ireland and an occasional visitor to the Republic of Ireland.\n\nAt a St Patrick's Day dinner four years ago, he revealed his lifetime ambition to visit all 32 counties on the island of Ireland.\n\nIn a speech to guests, he said he had already ticked 15 off the list at that stage.\n\n\"I am quite determined, before I drop dead and finally lose my marbles, that I should get around to the remaining 17,\" he added.", "The BBC\u2019s Analysis Editor Ros Atkins looks at how Yevgeny Prigozhin rose from hot dog salesman to become the boss of Russia\u2019s Wagner mercenary group.\n\nParts of this

met with quiet\n\nThere are hopes a ceasefire will take hold to end five days of fighting between Israel and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) militants in Gaza.\n\nIt got off to a shaky start, as both sides kept firing for two hours after the truce started on Saturday evening.\n\nAt least 33 Palestinians have been killed since Tuesday in Gaza, where Israel says it has struck PIJ targets.\n\nPalestinian rocket fire into Israel has killed two people, one Israeli and one Palestinian working in the country.\n\nThe mediation efforts were led by Egypt, which urged both sides to adhere to the ceasefire agreement.\n\nWashington welcomed the announcement of the ceasefire, and said US officials had worked with regional partners to achieve the resolution.\n\nBarrages of Palestinian rockets set off warning sirens in southern Israel, close to Gaza, and the suburbs of the city of Tel Aviv just before the truce was due to come into effect at 22:00 local time (19:00 GMT) on Saturday.\n\nMinutes after it supposedly started, militants launched more rockets at southern Israeli communities and the Israeli military carried out air strikes on what it said were two PIJ rocket launchers in Gaza.\n\nFurther rocket fire at around 23:00 drew another round of air strikes.\n\nMore than 1,200 rockets and mortars have been fired from Gaza towards Israel\n\nDespite the fighting, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office issued a statement confirming that a ceasefire had been agreed and thanked Egypt for its \"intensive efforts\" to secure one.\n\nIt also said Israel had made clear that its acceptance meant \"quiet will be met with quiet, and that if Israel is attacked or threatened, it will continue to do everything that it needs to in order to defend itself\".\n\nPIJ also confirmed the ceasefire, with a spokesman telling Reuters news agency: \"We will abide by it as long as the occupation [Israel] abides by it.\"\n\nAccording to a text from Egyptian intelligence seen by the BBC, Palestinian militants and Israel have agreed to stop actions targeting civilians and other individuals.\n\nThe BBC's Yolande Knell in Jerusalem says this form of wording appears to cover both the recent intense rocket fire from Gaza and Israel's controversial policy of targeted killings of militant leaders.\n\nIsrael began its military operation in Gaza before dawn on Tuesday, killing three leaders of PIJ in their homes as well as at least 10 civilians, including relatives and neighbours of the men.\n\nPIJ fighters then fired barrages of rockets at southern and central Israel, which they said were intended to avenge the dead.\n\nAt least 1,234 rockets and mortars have been fired from Gaza in total, with 976 crossing into Israeli territory, according to the Israeli military. Most have been intercepted or have landed in open areas, but some have hit homes and other buildings.\n\nOne woman was killed when a rocket hit an apartment building in the central city of Rehovot on Thursday, while a worker from Gaza was killed when he was hit by rocket shrapnel at a building site in the southern Sdot Negev region.\n\nThe military says 221 of the rockets have fallen short inside Gaza and that they have killed four people there, including three children. Islamic Jihad denies the allegation.\n\nIsrael has carried out air strikes on 371 PIJ targets across Gaza, killing three more leaders and destroying what it said were the group's rocket launch sites and command centres.\n\nAbout half of the 33 people killed in Gaza were civilians, including seven children and four women, according to local health officials.", "Frogmore Cottage, the UK home of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, has been offered to Prince Andrew, according to reports.\n\nHarry and Meghan have been issued with an eviction notice by Buckingham Palace, the Sun newspaper reported.\n\nBuckingham Palace has not commented and the BBC understands any discussions would be a private family matter.\n\nThe duke and duchess - who are based in the US - have been approached by the BBC via their foundation, Archewell.\n\nFrogmore Cottage, a Grade-II listed property in the grounds of Windsor Castle in Berkshire, was a gift to the royal couple from the late Queen.\n\nThey refurbished the property, owned by the Crown Estate, at an estimated cost of \u00a32.4m in 2018-19. The cost was initially covered by taxpayers through the Sovereign Grant before being repaid in full by Prince Harry.\n\nThe duke and duchess now live in California with their two children, Archie and Lilibet, after quitting life as working royals in 2020.\n\nThey retained the cottage as their UK residence, and last year celebrated their daughter's first birthday there.\n\nThe couple were reportedly told to leave the property by Buckingham Palace in January, days after Harry published his explosive memoir, Spare.\n\nThe Duke of York, the late Queen's second son, lives in the nearby Royal Lodge, in Windsor Great Park, Berkshire.\n\nAndrew stepped down as a working royal in 2019 after a controversial Newsnight interview about allegations that he had sexually assaulted Virginia Giuffre.\n\nIn February 2022, he paid an undisclosed sum to settle the civil sexual assault case Ms Giuffre brought against him in the US.\n\nHe has repeatedly denied the allegations.\n\nReports in recent weeks, not confirmed by the BBC, suggested the King is to cut Andrew's annual grant which could leave him unable to afford his home's running costs.\n\nHe is said to be resisting the offer of the smaller property, according to a source quoted by the Sun.", "Jack Johnson, brothers Finlay and Samuel Butler and their cousin Thomas Stewart died after falling into the icy lake\n\nFour boys died when they went on to a frozen lake near Solihull after they fed ducks and skimmed stones, an inquest heard.\n\nFinlay Butler, eight, and his younger brother Samuel, six, died, as did their cousin Thomas Stewart, 11, and another boy, Jack Johnson, 10.\n\nThey went into the water at Babbs Mill Park on 11 December 2022.\n\nThe inquest heard Finlay fell in first, Thomas and Jack as they tried to help and no-one saw Samuel fall in.\n\nThe boys went initially to feed the ducks and skim stones, Det Insp Jim Edmonds, from West Midlands Police, said.\n\nJack was with one group of children and the other three in another.\n\nJack then decided to go on the ice and Thomas, Finlay and Samuel followed.\n\nAfter they fell in, witnesses said they saw the boys in the water, shouting for help, but they could not get out and a short time later they went under the surface.\n\nVigils were held and flowers laid after the deaths of the boys\n\nDet Insp Edmonds said his officers were there 11 minutes after the first 999 call at about 14:35 GMT.\n\nThey ignored safety advice, took off their body armour and waded in to form a human chain, he added.\n\nHe said the air temperature was 5C (41F) and the water temperature was even lower which affected the ability of the officers to function.\n\nThere was a big risk to the rescuers themselves, Jason Wiles, from West Midlands Ambulance Service, said.\n\nParamedics shouted to the rescuers to get out and one of the police officers was in the water up to his neck, he added.\n\nMr Wiles said the officer probably only just got out the water in time.\n\nA tribute to the boys is in place at the park\n\nThe last child, Finlay, was recovered from the water by firefighters at 15:05 GMT, half an hour after the first 999 call.\n\nDet Insp Edmonds said he did not know why the ice broke but it was a \"terrible tragedy\".\n\nHe did not believe his team could have done anything differently, he told the inquest.\n\nThe air temperature on the day at the lake was 5C (41F) and the water temperature was even lower, the inquest heard\n\nThe boys all received the best treatment possible on their way to hospital but brain damage would have occurred within minutes after they were submerged, Mr Wiles said.\n\nDr Sarah Denniston, from Birmingham Heartlands Hospital, said efforts were made to resuscitate the boys without success and drowning was the cause of death.\n\nMemorial plaques have been left near the lake\n\nThe temperature of the water in the lake would have caused the boys' bodies to go into shock, Alex Chapman, from West Midlands Fire Service, said.\n\nHe also said nothing more could have been done on the day by firefighters.\n\nHowever the fire service would review its prevention work and planned regular safety campaigns in summer and winter to focus on the dangers of the water, he added.\n\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

When it comes to moderating violent images from wars, however, machines lack the nuance to identify human rights violations.\n\nIhor Zakharenko, a former travel journalist, encountered this in Ukraine. Since the Russian invasion he has been documenting attacks on civilians.\n\nThe BBC met him in a suburb of Kyiv where one year ago men, women and children had been shot dead by Russian troops while trying to flee occupation.\n\nHe filmed the bodies - at least 17 of them - and burnt-out cars.\n\nHe wanted to post the videos online so the world would see what happened and to counter the Kremlin's narrative. But when he uploaded them to Facebook and Instagram they were swiftly taken down.\n\n\"Russians themselves were saying those were fakes, [that] they didn't touch civilians, they fought only with the Ukrainian army,\" Ihor said.\n\nWe uploaded Ihor's footage on to Instagram and YouTube using dummy accounts.\n\nInstagram took down three of the four videos within a minute.\n\nAt first, YouTube applied age restrictions to the same three, but 10 minutes later removed them all.\n\nVideos documenting Russian attacks on civilians were taken down within minutes\n\nWe tried again - but they failed to upload altogether. An appeal to restore the videos on the basis that they included evidence of war crimes was rejected.\n\nKey figures within the industry say there is an urgent need for social media companies to prevent this kind of information from vanishing.\n\n\"You can see why they have developed and train their machines to, the moment they see something that looks difficult or traumatic, to take it down,\" Mr Rusbridger told the BBC. The Meta Oversight Board that he sits on was set up by Mark Zuckerberg and is known as a kind of independent \"supreme court\" for the company, which owns Facebook and Instagram.\n\n\"I think the next question for them is how do we develop the machinery, whether that's human or AI, to then make more reasonable decisions,\" Mr Rusbridger, a former editor-in-chief of the Guardian, adds.\n\nNo-one would deny tech firms' right to police content, says US Ambassador for Global Criminal Justice Beth Van Schaak: \"I think where the concern happens is when that information suddenly disappears.\"\n\nAtrocities from war are being documented on social media. This material can be used as evidence to help prosecute war crimes. But the BBC has spoken to people affected by violent conflict who have seen the major social media companies take down this content.\n\nYouTube and Meta say that under their exemptions for graphic war footage in the public interest, content that would normally be removed can be kept online with viewing restricted to adults. But our experiment with Ihor's videos suggest otherwise.\n\nMeta says it responds \"to valid legal requests from law enforcement agencies around the world\" and \"we continue to explore additional avenues to support international accountability processes\u2026 consistent with our legal and privacy obligations\".\n\nYouTube says that while it has exemptions for graphic content in the public interest, the platform is not an archive. It says, \"Human rights organisations; activists, human rights defenders, researchers, citizen journalists and others documenting human rights abuses (or other potential crimes) should observe best practices for securing and preserving their content.\"\n\nThe BBC also spoke to Imad, who owned a pharmacy in Aleppo, Syria, until a Syrian government barrel bomb landed nearby in 2013.\n\nHe recalls how the blast filled the room with dust and smoke. Hearing cries for help, he went to the market outside and saw hands, legs and dead bodies covered in blood.\n\nLocal TV crews captured these scenes. The footage was posted on YouTube and Facebook but has subsequently been taken down.\n\nIn the mayhem of the conflict, Syrian journalists told the BBC their own recordings of the original footage were also destroyed in bombing raids.\n\nYears later, when Imad was applying for asylum in the EU, he was asked to provide documents that proved he was at the scene.\n\n\"I was sure that my pharmacy was captured on camera. But when I went online, it was taking me to a deleted video.\"\n\nIn response to this sort of incident, organisations like Mnemonic, a Berlin-based human rights organisation, have stepped in to archive footage before it disappears.\n\nMnemonic developed a tool to automatically download and save evidence of human rights violations - first in Syria and now in Yemen, Sudan and Ukraine.\n\nThey have saved more than 700,000 images from war zones before they were removed from social media, including three videos showing the attack near Imad's pharmacy.\n\nEach image might hold a key clue to uncover what really transpired on the battlefield - the location, the date or the perpetrator.\n\nBut organisations like Mnemonic cannot cover every area of conflict around the world.\n\nProving that war crimes have been committed is incredibly hard - so getting as many sources as possible is vital.\n\n\"Verification is like solving a puzzle - you put together seemingly unrelated pieces of information to build a bigger picture of what happened,\" says BBC Verify's Olga Robinson.\n\nThe task of archiving open-source material - available to pretty much anyone on social media - often falls to people with a mission to help their relatives caught up in violent conflict.\n\nRahwa says it is her \"duty\" to archive open-source material from the conflict in the Tigray region of Ethiopia\n\nRahwa lives in the United States and has family in the Tigray region of Ethiopia, which has been wracked with violence in recent years, and where the authorities in Ethiopia tightly control the flow of information.\n\nHowever, social media means there is a visual record of a conflict that might otherwise remain hidden from the outside world.\n\n\"It was our duty,\" says Rahwa. \"I spent hours doing research, and so when you're seeing this content trickle in you're trying to verify using all the open-source intelligence tools you can get your hands on, but you don't know if your family is OK.\"\n\nHuman rights campaigners say there is an urgent need for a formal system to gather and safely store deleted content. This would include preserving metadata to help verify the content and prove it hasn't been tampered with.\n\nMs Van Schaak, the US Ambassador for Global Criminal Justice, says: \"We need to create a mechanism whereby that information can be preserved for potential future accountability exercises. Social media platforms should be willing to make arrangements with accountability mechanisms around the world.\"\n\nRead more about BBC Verify: Explaining the 'how' - the launch of BBC Verify", "Dr Alena Yap is the only doctor available to Eleuthera Abus on an archipelago of 13,000 people\n\nWhen 99-year-old Eleuthera Abus lifts her right arm, she winces as the broken bones move. It's been six months since her fall.\n\n\"All I can do is manage her pain,\" says Alena Yap, the 28-year-old doctor who is examining her on her porch. \"She really needs to have the bone pinned. But the family is refusing to take her to hospital.\"\n\nEleuthera's daughters are not heartless. They are poor.\n\nThe nearest surgical facility is hundreds of miles away across the sea from the tiny island of Diit where they live. It's one of a cluster of islands that make up the Agutaya archipelago, stranded in the middle of the Philippines' Sulu Sea.\n\nFor the 13,000 or so people who live here, Dr Alena, as they call her, is the only doctor. Petite, with glasses and long hair tied back in a ponytail, she always wears a broad smile that masks quiet determination.\n\nThere is only one island in the archipelago she does not visit - Amanpulo, named after the luxury resort on it, which has reportedly hosted Tom Cruise and Beyonc\u00e9. On a clear day, it's visible from the beaches of Diit, just 20km (12 miles) away.\n\nDr Alena arrived just before the coronavirus - and learned to live with the death threats that came when she insisted people isolate. But the pandemic that swallowed the world was far from her only challenge in this oft-forgotten corner of the Philippines. She battled new diseases and old, and came up against her country's biggest challenges. She says she came to Agutaya to make \"real changes\" - but she left deeply disillusioned.\n\nThese remote, volcanic islands are not where you expect to find a graduate of the country's top medical school, who had spent all her life in Manila, the teeming Philippine capital. Unlike so many of her peers who have left to seek careers in Australia, America and Britain, Dr Alena volunteered to join a government programme that sent her here, to one of the poorest municipalities in the country.\n\nThe main island of Agutaya is a two-and-half day journey from Manila. It includes one flight, followed by a sleepless 15-hour night crossing on an open-deck ferry from the port city of Iloilo to a bigger island called Cuyo. Then the only way in and out of Agutaya is a drenching, two-hour roller coaster ride in an outrigger canoe.\n\nThese islands, floating in startlingly clear waters over white sands, look like they are straight out of paradise\n\nAs the skilled boatman guides the outrigger across the reef and into the shallows, Agutaya looks like a piece of paradise. Below the palm-fringed shoreline, a broad swathe of white sand stretches in each direction. Colourful outrigger canoes bob around on water so clear they could be floating in mid-air.\n\nBut geography is both a blessing and a curse. Scattered over hundreds of square kilometres of sea, the dozen or so islands that make up the archipelago are cut off for days, even weeks, when the monsoon comes, winds in tow. Covered with dense forest, the hillsides sit atop large fields of basalt boulders. There is little tillable soil. The islanders rely almost entirely on the ocean.\n\nDr Alena made her first crossing to Agutaya in February 2020. \"When I started here, I was 26 and a lot of people would mistake me for a high school student,\" she says with a chuckle. \"People wouldn't believe I was a doctor.\"\n\nHer first challenge arrived within a month when the coronavirus sent the Philippines into a lockdown. The islands were sealed off.\n\n\"The first year wasn't too bad,\" Dr Alena says. \"There weren't any local cases. But the second year [2021], that is when the government allowed everyone to travel back to their hometowns. Suddenly we had people coming back from as far away as Manila.\"\n\nDr Alena was in charge of enforcing their quarantine. \"When people learned they would be quarantined they reacted violently,\" she says. \"I received death threats. People said they wanted to shoot me.\"\n\nShe understood why. People here live day to day. What they catch in the morning they eat for dinner. If they couldn't leave their homes to fish, they would go hungry.\n\nSo far from being embraced by the local community, Dr Alena, who had left her fianc\u00e9 in far-away Manila, was now resented as a government enforcer. \"There were days when I couldn't do anything but cry. There were a lot of tears,\" she says.\n\nTo ease the loneliness she began adopting dogs. Bruno is large with a big tail that never stops wagging, while Vigly is small and shy. They follow her everywhere.\n\n\"I spent a lot of time going to the beach with them and watching the sunset. I also started to draw. My pictures aren't any good, but it's a type of art therapy.\"\n\nThe pandemic, and the loneliness it bought, was especially trying for the 28-year-old\n\nThe next challenge emerged when the vaccines started to arrive in the summer of 2021.\n\n\"We had to go house to house to every island barangay [village],\" Dr Alena says. \"The farthest island is nearly three hours away by boat, and many people can't afford the fare [to come to the clinic]. So they wouldn't come.\"\n\nGruelling as it was, the distance wasn't the only problem: \"There was a lot of hesitancy, a lot of fake news about the vaccines being bad or that they can kill people. A lot of people get their news from social media here, and they were not getting the facts.\"\n\nBy autumn 2022, the threat from Covid had begun to abate. Despite the resistance, the vaccine rollout was successful. Only eight islanders across the archipelago had died of the virus.\n\nBut that brought little respite.\n\nA line starts to form on every weekday morning outside the main clinic on Agutaya while the daily meeting between Dr Alena and her team is still under way.\n\nOn that day, first in line is a man in his 50s who has had a suspected stroke.\n\n\"Before I came here, I thought everything would be fresh and organic,\" Dr Alena says, laughing at her own naivete. \"But it's very difficult to get a nutritious diet here.\"\n\nFor one, locals salt and dry their fish, leading to high blood pressure. Diabetes is also common because it's easier to find soft drinks than clean water.\n\nA boy walks to school on the island of Diit\n\nA sign at the entrance to the clinic announces the other major health problem: \"sputum sampling\" for tuberculosis or TB.\n\nDr Alens says they recorded 45 cases in 2022, but many more go undiagnosed.\n\nA bacterial infection, TB is fatal if left untreated. It kills millions yearly, although a combination of vaccines and antibiotics eradicated it from some parts of the world before the middle of the last century.\n\nBut the Philippines is still estimated to have more than a million cases. \"The long-term plan is to eradicate it,\" Dr Alena says, adding it's \"impossible in the near future\". She says because of poor access to healthcare people often relapse, and have even begun to develop drug-resistant strains.\n\nLater that morning, a woman brings her young son to the clinic. Pale and listless, the boy slumps on a chair. Dr Alena suspects he has dengue. A few minutes later, it's confirmed. She prescribes paracetamol, and tells his mother to keep him hydrated.\n\nDengue is new here. The one case in January turned to 10 by March even as Dr Alena and her team sprayed school grounds to kill the mosquitoes that spread it, and handed out treated nets.\n\nBy 11:00 the doctor is extricating herself from the growing line of patients. They will have to be dealt with by her capable nursing staff because she has to get across to Diit, 40 minutes away by boat.\n\nIt is more beautiful than Agutaya, but poorer. It has no electricity or a mobile phone tower, and only one concrete road that runs out after a few hundred metres.\n\nThe arrival of the \"medicine lady\" as Dr Alena is fondly called is greeted with much excitement. Dozens of school children come running down the beach. They've been given the day off so Dr Alena's dengue control team can spray their school grounds with insecticide. As she walks through the village, she's like the pied piper, with a long stream of laughing children following.\n\nShe visits an elderly couple sitting outside their house along the beach in wheelchairs. Both have had strokes and are partially paralysed. She checks his blood pressure - 150 over 90. \"It's high, but acceptable for his age,\" she says.\n\nOn these islands, a hernia, like the one this boy has, can bankrupt a family\n\nA woman in her 40s pushes her way through the crowd that has gathered around. She is carrying a boy, who is perhaps five or six years old. Dr Alena tells her to sit down on a chair and begins to examine the child. He has a hugely enlarged left testicle. The torch reveals a hernia in his lower abdomen. A part of his intestine has penetrated the bowel wall, pushing into his testicles.\n\n\"He will need surgery,\" Dr Alena tells the mother. The hope in the woman's eyes turns to anxiety.\n\nDr Alena asks her if she knows anyone who she can stay with on one of the bigger islands. Yes, the woman says - in Culion, a 12-hour boat ride away.\n\n\"Once I tell them they need to have an operation, you see in their faces the fear and the sadness because they realise there isn't any medicine I can give them to cure this,\" Dr Alena says. \"You see in their minds [the thought] how are they going to afford this? It's hard being the one to deliver the news.\"\n\nIn another part of the world, a hernia is a minor medical procedure. But here it can wipe out a family's savings, leaving them in debt for years.\n\n\"If we could make travel easier that would make a lot of difference,\" she adds. \"But that's hard because it will take a lot of resources.\"\n\nAfter three years on the island, Dr Alena's optimism and ambition have given way to the disheartening realisation that resources - or money - will always be the biggest challenge.\n\nA concrete all-weather road runs along the base of the rocky hills that circle the main island of Agutaya. Construction began alongside campaigning for the local election last year. One lane was finished before election day, but islanders say work stopped after that. There is no second lane yet.\n\n\"We'll have to wait for the next elections to get the road finished,\" quips one local.\n\nAgutaya and the islands around it are too tiny to matter to Manila, locals say\n\nOn the other end of the island, rusting steel bars stick out of an incomplete concrete structure that is gradually being overrun by vegetation.\n\nIt was supposed to be the new rural health unit, Dr Alena says. Work stopped last year because the local government ran out of money. \"But they haven't completed their part of the deal,\" she says, her frustration palpable.\n\nPhilippine politics is not driven by parties, but personalities, and dominated by large, powerful clans whose chiefs promise resources from Manila in return for votes. As one local woman put it, Agutaya is too small a community: \"There aren't enough votes here that make it worth the money.\"\n\nLocal politicians have little incentive to change and come election time, vote-buying is common enough that it now seems to have a well-worn price: 500 pesos, or $9 (\u00a37). Corruption runs deep, and the money pouring in doesn't seem to reach its destination.\n\n\"I came here very idealistic,\" Dr Alena says, sighing. \"I was very aggressive to try and change the way the local health system worked. But then as time goes on you realise that three years is far too short to make any big changes.\"\n\nAs her time on Agutaya - a three-year-contract - drew to an end, many islanders told her they would be sad to see her go. \"Time flies fast,\" said Ricardo, one of the senior nursing assistants, who described her as \"selfless and hardworking\".\n\nAs much as she helped, Dr Alena says she feels deeply frustrated at the end of her stint\n\nBut in the weeks since returning to Manila, Dr Alena says she has felt disappointed and even cynical about her experience working for local government. She was offered a job at the provincial health administration in Palawan but turned it down. Instead she wants to work in a medical charity or NGO.\n\nLast week, she returned to Agutaya as part of an NGO-run programme. For decades, the NGO, with the help of local and international donors, has been regularly sending specialist doctors to the islands to do minor surgeries.\n\nBut this time Dr Alena's journey didn't last two and half days. She, along with other doctors, arrived there three hours after taking off from Manila - they touched down on a runway on the luxury island of Amanpulo.", "Usually iPhones plummet in value as soon as you take them out of the shop.\n\nBut there are some special cases, as seen at an auction in the US, where a first edition, unopened 4GB model sold for $190,372.80 (\u00a3145,416).\n\nNot many of these were made at the time, leading the model to be considered the \"Holy Grail\" by iPhone collectors.\n\nThe lot, run by LCG Auctions, attracted 28 bids in total and sold at nearly 400 times its original price.\n\nThe final fee includes the administration costs on top of the hammer price paid to the auction house by the buyer, known as a \"buyer's premium\".\n\nThe buyer's premium goes directly to the auction house and not to the seller.\n\nLCG Auctions described it as \"a popular high-end\" and \"red-hot collectable\", adding that two other factory-sealed, first edition iPhones had sold at record values in the last year.\n\nThe website described the model as an \"exceedingly rare, factory sealed, first-release 4GB model in exceptional condition. Virtually flawless along the surface and edges, the factory seal is clean with correct seam details and tightness\".\n\nOriginally retailing at $599 (\u00a3457), the lot was expected to fetch in the region of $50,000-$100,000 - but managed to smash all previous records.\n\nFirst released in 2007 by the then Apple CEO Steve Jobs, the tech giant made the decision to discontinue the 4GB model just two months after it was launched, due to lagging sales.\n\nMost people decided to purchase the 8GB model, which was launched at the same time, and gave users double the storage space, for just $100 more.\n\nEvery few months, some rare Apple memorabilia or relics of Mr Jobs' life and career sells at auction.\n\nThey include a poem he wrote in a classmate's high school yearbook, photos of him in college and a business card from 1978.\n\nIn 2011 the Apple co-founder died at the age of 56 after suffering from pancreatic cancer. Apple said he had been \"the source of countless innovations that enrich and improve all of our lives\" and had made the world \"immeasurably better\".\n\nHe introduced the colourful iMac computer, the iPod, the iPhone and the iPad to the world.", "Thousands of people have been evacuated from wildfires on the Greek island of Rhodes.\n\nTourists have fled from their hotels to emergency shelters, while some holidaymakers returning to the UK described people being covered in ash and still smelling of smoke from the fires.", "Dr Alena Yap is the only doctor available to Eleuthera Abus on an archipelago of 13,000 people\n\nWhen 99-year-old Eleuthera Abus lifts her right arm, she winces as the broken bones move. It's been six months since her fall.\n\n\"All I can do is manage her pain,\" says Alena Yap, the 28-year-old doctor who is examining her on her porch. \"She really needs to have the bone pinned. But the family is refusing to take her to hospital.\"\n\nEleuthera's daughters are not heartless. They are poor.\n\nThe nearest surgical facility is hundreds of miles away across the sea from the tiny island of Diit where they live. It's one of a cluster of islands that make up the Agutaya archipelago, stranded in the middle of the Philippines' Sulu Sea.\n\nFor the 13,000 or so people who live here, Dr Alena, as they call her, is the only doctor. Petite, with glasses and long hair tied back in a ponytail, she always wears a broad smile that masks quiet determination.\n\nThere is only one island in the archipelago she does not visit - Amanpulo, named after the luxury resort on it, which has reportedly hosted Tom Cruise and Beyonc\u00e9. On a clear day, it's visible from the beaches of Diit, just 20km (12 miles) away.\n\nDr Alena arrived just before the coronavirus - and learned to live with the death threats that came when she insisted people isolate. But the pandemic that swallowed the world was far from her only challenge in this oft-forgotten corner of the Philippines. She battled new diseases and old, and came up against her country's biggest challenges. She says she came to Agutaya to make \"real changes\" - but she left deeply disillusioned.\n\nThese remote, volcanic islands are not where you expect to find a graduate of the country's top medical school, who had spent all her life in Manila, the teeming Philippine capital. Unlike so many of her peers who have left to seek careers in Australia, America and Britain, Dr Alena volunteered to join a government programme that sent her here, to one of the poorest municipalities in the country.\n\nThe main island of Agutaya is a two-and-half day journey from Manila. It includes one flight, followed by a sleepless 15-hour night crossing on an open-deck ferry from the port city of Iloilo to a bigger island called Cuyo. Then the only way in and out of Agutaya is a drenching, two-hour roller coaster ride in an outrigger canoe.\n\nThese islands, floating in startlingly clear waters over white sands, look like they are straight out of paradise\n\nAs the skilled boatman guides the outrigger across the reef and into the shallows, Agutaya looks like a piece of paradise. Below the palm-fringed shoreline, a broad swathe of white sand stretches in each direction. Colourful outrigger canoes bob around on water so clear they could be floating in mid-air.\n\nBut geography is both a blessing and a curse. Scattered over hundreds of square kilometres of sea, the dozen or so islands that make up the archipelago are cut off for days, even weeks, when the monsoon comes, winds in tow. Covered with dense forest, the hillsides sit atop large fields of basalt boulders. There is little tillable soil. The islanders rely almost entirely on the ocean.\n\nDr Alena made her first crossing to Agutaya in February 2020. \"When I started here, I was 26 and a lot of people would mistake me for a high school student,\" she says with a chuckle. \"People wouldn't believe I was a doctor.\"\n\nHer first challenge arrived within a month when the coronavirus sent the Philippines into a lockdown. The islands were sealed off.\n\n\"The first year wasn't too bad,\" Dr Alena says. \"There weren't any local cases. But the second year [2021], that is when the government allowed everyone to travel back to their hometowns. Suddenly we had people coming back from as far away as Manila.\"\n\nDr Alena was in charge of enforcing their quarantine. \"When people learned they would be quarantined they reacted violently,\" she says. \"I received death threats. People said they wanted to shoot me.\"\n\nShe understood why. People here live day to day. What they catch in the morning they eat for dinner. If they couldn't leave their homes to fish, they would go hungry.\n\nSo far from being embraced by the local community, Dr Alena, who had left her fianc\u00e9 in far-away Manila, was now resented as a government enforcer. \"There were days when I couldn't do anything but cry. There were a lot of tears,\" she says.\n\nTo ease the loneliness she began adopting dogs. Bruno is large with a big tail that never stops wagging, while Vigly is small and shy. They follow her everywhere.\n\n\"I spent a lot of time going to the beach with them and watching the sunset. I also started to draw. My pictures aren't any good, but it's a type of art therapy.\"\n\nThe pandemic, and the loneliness it bought, was especially trying for the 28-year-old\n\nThe next challenge emerged when the vaccines started to arrive in the summer of 2021.\n\n\"We had to go house to house to every island barangay [village],\" Dr Alena says. \"The farthest island is nearly three hours away by boat, and many people can't afford the fare [to come to the clinic]. So they wouldn't come.\"\n\nGruelling as it was, the distance wasn't the only problem: \"There was a lot of hesitancy, a lot of fake news about the vaccines being bad or that they can kill people. A lot of people get their news from social media here, and they were not getting the facts.\"\n\nBy autumn 2022, the threat from Covid had begun to abate. Despite the resistance, the vaccine rollout was successful. Only eight islanders across the archipelago had died of the virus.\n\nBut that brought little respite.\n\nA line starts to form on every weekday morning outside the main clinic on Agutaya while the daily meeting between Dr Alena and her team is still under way.\n\nOn that day, first in line is a man in his 50s who has had a suspected stroke.\n\n\"Before I came here, I thought everything would be fresh and organic,\" Dr Alena says, laughing at her own naivete. \"But it's very difficult to get a nutritious diet here.\"\n\nFor one, locals salt and dry their fish, leading to high blood pressure. Diabetes is also common because it's easier to find soft drinks than clean water.\n\nA boy walks to school on the island of Diit\n\nA sign at the entrance to the clinic announces the other major health problem: \"sputum sampling\" for tuberculosis or TB.\n\nDr Alens says they recorded 45 cases in 2022, but many more go undiagnosed.\n\nA bacterial infection, TB is fatal if left untreated. It kills millions yearly, although a combination of vaccines and antibiotics eradicated it from some parts of the world before the middle of the last century.\n\nBut the Philippines is still estimated to have more than a million cases. \"The long-term plan is to eradicate it,\" Dr Alena says, adding it's \"impossible in the near future\". She says because of poor access to healthcare people often relapse, and have even begun to develop drug-resistant strains.\n\nLater that morning, a woman brings her young son to the clinic. Pale and listless, the boy slumps on a chair. Dr Alena suspects he has dengue. A few minutes later, it's confirmed. She prescribes paracetamol, and tells his mother to keep him hydrated.\n\nDengue is new here. The one case in January turned to 10 by March even as Dr Alena and her team sprayed school grounds to kill the mosquitoes that spread it, and handed out treated nets.\n\nBy 11:00 the doctor is extricating herself from the growing line of patients. They will have to be dealt with by her capable nursing staff because she has to get across to Diit, 40 minutes away by boat.\n\nIt is more beautiful than Agutaya, but poorer. It has no electricity or a mobile phone tower, and only one concrete road that runs out after a few hundred metres.\n\nThe arrival of the \"medicine lady\" as Dr Alena is fondly called is greeted with much excitement. Dozens of school children come running down the beach. They've been given the day off so Dr Alena's dengue control team can spray their school grounds with insecticide. As she walks through the village, she's like the pied piper, with a long stream of laughing children following.\n\nShe visits an elderly couple sitting outside their house along the beach in wheelchairs. Both have had strokes and are partially paralysed. She checks his blood pressure - 150 over 90. \"It's high, but acceptable for his age,\" she says.\n\nOn these islands, a hernia, like the one this boy has, can bankrupt a family\n\nA woman in her 40s pushes her way through the crowd that has gathered around. She is carrying a boy, who is perhaps five or six years old. Dr Alena tells her to sit down on a chair and begins to examine the child. He has a hugely enlarged left testicle. The torch reveals a hernia in his lower abdomen. A part of his intestine has penetrated the bowel wall, pushing into his testicles.\n\n\"He will need surgery,\" Dr Alena tells the mother. The hope in the woman's eyes turns to anxiety.\n\nDr Alena asks her if she knows anyone who she can stay with on one of the bigger islands. Yes, the woman says - in Culion, a 12-hour boat ride away.\n\n\"Once I tell them they need to have an operation, you see in their faces the fear and the sadness because they realise there isn't any medicine I can give them to cure this,\" Dr Alena says. \"You see in their minds [the thought] how are they going to afford this? It's hard being the one to deliver the news.\"\n\nIn another part of the world, a hernia is a minor medical procedure. But here it can wipe out a family's savings, leaving them in debt for years.\n\n\"If we could make travel easier that would make a lot of difference,\" she adds. \"But that's hard because it will take a lot of resources.\"\n\nAfter three years on the island, Dr Alena's optimism and ambition have given way to the disheartening realisation that resources - or money - will always be the biggest challenge.\n\nA concrete all-weather road runs along the base of the rocky hills that circle the main island of Agutaya. Construction began alongside campaigning for the local election last year. One lane was finished before election day, but islanders say work stopped after that. There is no second lane yet.\n\n\"We'll have to wait for the next elections to get the road finished,\" quips one local.\n\nAgutaya and the islands around it are too tiny to matter to Manila, locals say\n\nOn the other end of the island, rusting steel bars stick out of an incomplete concrete structure that is gradually being overrun by vegetation.\n\nIt was supposed to be the new rural health unit, Dr Alena says. Work stopped last year because the local government ran out of money. \"But they haven't completed their part of the deal,\" she says, her frustration palpable.\n\nPhilippine politics is not driven by parties, but personalities, and dominated by large, powerful clans whose chiefs promise resources from Manila in return for votes. As one local woman put it, Agutaya is too small a community: \"There aren't enough votes here that make it worth the money.\"\n\nLocal politicians have little incentive to change and come election time, vote-buying is common enough that it now seems to have a well-worn price: 500 pesos, or $9 (\u00a37). Corruption runs deep, and the money pouring in doesn't seem to reach its destination.\n\n\"I came here very idealistic,\" Dr Alena says, sighing. \"I was very aggressive to try and change the way the local health system worked. But then as time goes on you realise that three years is far too short to make any big changes.\"\n\nAs her time on Agutaya - a three-year-contract - drew to an end, many islanders told her they would be sad to see her go. \"Time flies fast,\" said Ricardo, one of the senior nursing assistants, who described her as \"selfless and hardworking\".\n\nAs much as she helped, Dr Alena says she feels deeply frustrated at the end of her stint\n\nBut in the weeks since returning to Manila, Dr Alena says she has felt disappointed and even cynical about her experience working for local government. She was offered a job at the provincial health administration in Palawan but turned it down. Instead she wants to work in a medical charity or NGO.\n\nLast week, she returned to Agutaya as part of an NGO-run programme. For decades, the NGO, with the help of local and international donors, has been regularly sending specialist doctors to the islands to do minor surgeries.\n\nBut this time Dr Alena's journey didn't last two and half days. She, along with other doctors, arrived there three hours after taking off from Manila - they touched down on a runway on the luxury island of Amanpulo.", "Willoughby said it felt \"very strange indeed sitting here without Phil\"\n\nHolly Willoughby has said she feels \"shaken, troubled and let down\" as she returned to ITV's This Morning.\n\nThe presenter's appearance on Monday's show was her first since the departure of her co-host Phillip Schofield.\n\nWilloughby addressed viewers directly and said it felt \"very strange indeed sitting here without Phil\".\n\nShe added recent events had been \"a lot to process\" and thanked viewers for their messages of support.\n\nHer statement received a mixed response on social media, with some viewers questioning her authenticity.\n\nSchofield left his role on This Morning last month following reports of a rift with Willoughby.\n\nThe 61-year-old later exited ITV altogether after he admitted lying about an affair he had with a young male colleague while he was still married.\n\nJosie Gibson is currently standing in as Willoughby's co-presenter\n\nOn Monday, Willoughby asked viewers: \"Are you OK? I hope so, it feels very strange indeed sitting here without Phil. I imagine you might be feeling a lot like I have, shaken, troubled, let down, worried for the wellbeing of people on all sides of what's going on, and full of questions.\n\n\"You, me and all of us at This Morning gave our love and support to someone who was not telling the truth, who acted in a way that they themselves felt they had to resign from ITV and step down from a career that they loved.\n\n\"That is a lot to process, and it's equally hard to see the toll that it's taken on their own mental health.\"\n\nWilloughby presented Monday's episode of This Morning alongside Josie Gibson, a former Big Brother winner who regularly guest presents the ITV daytime show.\n\nWilloughby continued: \"I think what unites us all now is a desire to heal, for the health and wellbeing of everyone. I hope that as we start this new chapter and get back to a place of warmth and magic that this show holds for all of us, we can find strength in each other.\n\n\"And from my heart, can I just say thank you for all of your kind messages, and thank you for being here this morning. Every single person that works on this show will continue to work hard every single day to bring you the show that we love.\"\n\nIn an interview with BBC News last week, Schofield said he had accepted his career was over following the affair, describing it as a \"grave error\".\n\nA source close to Schofield told the Sun he would not be watching Willoughby's return on Monday, commenting: \"He physically could not watch - he's not there yet. Even listening to the opening credits would be hugely triggering.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: Phillip Schofield said the affair was his \"biggest, sorriest secret\"\n\nWilloughby's statement at the start of Monday's This Morning seemed heartfelt and difficult for her to deliver - she was seen holding Gibson's hand for emotional support.\n\nPerhaps one of the most striking things was that Willoughby only used Schofield's name once, right at the beginning.\n\nAfter that, she did not even refer to his gender when discussing recent events. \"They themselves felt they had to resign from ITV and step down from a career that they loved,\" she said in reference to Schofield.\n\nWilloughby's continued presence on the programme will depend on her authenticity, and some viewers on social media were sceptical about her statement.\n\nSome users drew comparisons with the speech Jennifer Aniston's character gave in Apple TV's The Morning Show - which also had a storyline about a disgraced former presenter. Others compared Willoughby's tears to former health secretary Matt Hancock's on Good Morning Britain in 2021.\n\nOne viewer recalled guest presenter Alison Hammond becoming emotional about Schofield last week, writing: \"On Friday, I believed Alison and you could tell she was truly upset. Unfortunately, I didn't feel the same listening to Holly Willoughby this morning.\"\n\nAnother viewer referred to Willoughby's almost angelic on-screen look: \"If I was a cynical person, I'd say they've made a very conscious decision to dress Holly Willoughby in white for her big speech.\"\n\nWilloughby's emotional opening speech did not overshadow the rest of the programme. She and Gibson cleanly and skilfully segued into the show's regular tone and content\n\nAny viewers who happened to tune in at 10:05 would never have known from watching the subsequent items about hay fever, holiday scams and BBQ king prawns that the episode had opened in such an unusually serious way.\n\nThe next few weeks will be crucial for Willoughby in proving she can still connect with viewers\n\nThis will have been exactly what bosses wanted, sending the message to viewers - and advertisers - that it's very much business as usual and the programme is not going anywhere.\n\nBut will the audience be convinced? Those watching on Twitter, admittedly an unrepresentative platform, were sceptical of Willoughby and the sincerity of her statement.\n\nIf the TV star wants to survive on the show, she will have to use the next few weeks to prove that she can still connect with viewers and build an authentic chemistry with the various guest hosts.", "Last updated on .From the section Tennis\n\nCarlos Alcaraz won the Wimbledon men's singles title for the first time by ending Novak Djokovic's recent dominance with a stunning victory.\n\nSpain's Alcaraz, 20, fought back from a nervy start to win 1-6 7-6 (8-6) 6-1 3-6 6-4 against the defending champion.\n\nDjokovic was going for a fifth straight win, an eighth men's triumph and a 24th major - all record-equalling feats.\n\nBut the 36-year-old Serb was outlasted by top seed Alcaraz, who underlined his class by winning a second major title.\n\n\"It is a dream come true for me,\" Alcaraz, who was playing in only his fourth grass-court tournament, said.\n\n\"Even if I lost, I would have been proud of myself. To be able to play in these stages of these occasions - as a boy of 20 years old - is really fast.\n\n\"I'm really proud of myself.\"\n\nAlcaraz, who won his first Grand Slam title at the US Open last year, celebrated by falling flat on his face after taking his first match point and kicking a ball into the crowd.\n\u2022 None 'Wimbledon win the happiest moment of my life'\n\u2022 None 'Tough one to swallow' - Djokovic tearful after loss\n\nThe majority of a packed Centre Court, which included the Prince and Princess of Wales, actor Brad Pitt and two-time winner Andy Murray, rose to their feet to acclaim the All England Club's newest champion.\n\nAs tradition now dictates, Alcaraz ran up the stairs from the court to his box and embraced coach Juan Carlos Ferrero, along with his family and friends.\n\nAlcaraz is the third youngest man to win the Wimbledon title in the Open era after 17-year-old Boris Becker in 1985 and 20-year-old Bjorn Borg in 1976.\n\n\"You never like to lose matches like this but I guess when all the emotions are settled I have to still be very grateful,\" said 23-time Grand Slam champion Djokovic, who broke down in tears during his on-court speech.\n\n\"I won many tough matches here. Maybe I have won a couple of finals I should have lost so maybe this is even-steven.\n\n\"It is a tough one to swallow when you are so close. I lost to a better player, I have to congratulate him, and move on - stronger hopefully.\"\n\nBefore an eagerly anticipated men's final between the top two seeds, Djokovic further ramped up the excitement by predicting a \"feast\" between a pair with equally \"hungry\" appetites for success.\n\nA compelling contest - full of quality, drama and momentum swings - lived up to the hype.\n\nThe pair have been two of the leading players on the ATP Tour this year and jostled for position as the world number one.\n\nDjokovic won the Australian Open and French Open this year to move ahead of Rafael Nadal's tally of 22 major titles, knowing another victory would equal Margaret Court's all-time record of 24 victories.\n\nAt the opposite end of the career scale, Alcaraz was aiming to prove not all of the younger generation can be overawed by Djokovic's greatness.\n\nThe Spaniard had already been dealt a chastening experience when facing Djokovic, having suffered body cramps during their French Open semi-final last month because he was so overcome by nerves.\n\nOne of the plotlines going into the Wimbledon final centred on Alcaraz's state of mind.\n\nAlcaraz was confident that fear was out of his system going into Sunday's showpiece - but that did not look to be the case in a one-sided first set, which Djokovic won after just 34 minutes.\n\nDjokovic suffocated his opponent with his deep and consistent returning, forcing Alcaraz into hurrying his shots and making too many mistakes.\n\nAlcaraz slowly grew into the contest, finding more rhythm with his groundstrokes and introducing an increasing number of the drop shots for which he is becoming known.\n\nAfter turning the deficit into a lead, helped by edging a mammoth 27-minute game early in the third set, Alcaraz produced two loose errors at a crucial time in the fourth and Djokovic went on to level.\n\nHowever, Alcaraz's composure returned in the decider.\n\nHe broke for a 2-1 lead which led to Djokovic smashing his racquet on the net post and, continuing to play with power and variety, served out a stunning victory after four hours and 42 minutes.\n\nDjokovic still well placed to create further history\n\nThe tears from Djokovic after the match were indicative of the physical and mental effort he puts into creating even more history.\n\nThe defeat meant he was unable to equal Roger Federer's men's record of eight Wimbledon titles and Court's all-time record of 24 major wins.\n\nDjokovic also saw two mind-boggling runs - 34 successive match wins going back to 2017, and 45 straight victories on Centre Court stretching back to 2013 - ended by Alcaraz.\n\nDespite the disappointing manner of the loss, there was plenty to suggest the veteran is still well placed to at least equal Federer's and Court's tallies.\n\nHis game, physicality and elasticity remain as good as ever.\n\n\"I hope this will be the beginning of a rivalry for some time - for my sake,\" said Djokovic on the prospect of more duels with Alcaraz.\n\n\"He's going to be on the tour for quite some time. I don't know how long I'll be around.\n\n\"I hope we get to play at the US Open.

Publicly acknowledging these institutional issues exist in our organisation is essential to our absolute commitment to championing equality and becoming an anti-racist service,\n\n\"It is also critical to our determination to lead wider change and support wider change in society.\"\n\nSir Iain, who is to retire on 10 August, admitted that people from different backgrounds or with different requirements \"don't always get the service that is their right\" and that this was also true for the force's own officers and staff.\n\nSir William Macpherson's definition of institutional racism, set out in his 1999 report into the killing of black teenager Stephen Lawrence, is the collective failure of an organisation to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour, culture, or ethnic origin.\n\nIt can include processes, attitudes and behaviour which amount to discrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness and racist stereotyping.\n\nSir Iain Livingstone is to retire as chief constable in the summer\n\nSir Iain said the force had already put in place measures including enhanced vetting of its officers and a more rigorous recruitment process to help tackle the issue.\n\nFirst Minister Humza Yousaf said that, as a person of colour, the admission of institutional racism by the chief constable was \"monumental\" and \"historic\".\n\nMr Yousaf said he had personal experience of racism within the police, having been \"searched over a dozen times as a young boy, whether it was in my car or walking with my friends in the street or in airports\".\n\nPolice Scotland last year launched a four-year strategy called \"Policing Together\" to tackle discrimination in the force and in the community, with a mandatory leadership programme to be rolled out to about 5,000 officers and staff to improve the existing workplace culture.\n\nThe force has faced a number of concerns about that culture in recent years.\n\nSome women who are former officers spoke to the BBC's Newsnight about a \"boys club\" culture at all levels of Police Scotland.\n\nOne of them, former firearms officer Rhona Malone, won almost \u00a31m in compensation from the force after an employment tribunal found she had been victimised when she had raised concerns about sexism.\n\nFormer Police Scotland firearms officer Rhona Malone was victimised after raising concerns about sexism\n\nMs Malone said the chief constable's admission was welcome, and that she hoped it would help officers within the force who are currently challenging Police Scotland on these issues.\n\nHowever she said she was angry that it had taken so long to recognise the problem, and that officers who had raised concerns were still \"getting pushback\".\n\nThe force is also under pressure due to an ongoing public inquiry into the death of Sheku Bayoh, who died after he was restrained by police officers in Kirkcaldy.\n\nThe inquiry is investigating the circumstances of the 31-year-old's death and whether race was a factor.\n\nAdmitting Police Scotland has serious institutional failures is a bold move when you've been in charge of the force for more than half its existence.\n\nThis politically savvy chief constable will say it's the right thing to do and the right time to do it, as he prepares to step down.\n\nSir Iain Livingstone's words will be closely examined at the public inquiry which is investigating whether race was a factor when Sheku Bayoh died in police custody eight years ago. Sir Iain took care to mention Mr Bayoh's family today.\n\nHis statement will be applauded by many in civic Scotland at a time when the force's handling of its investigation into the SNP has attracted criticism from some political quarters.\n\nAs for the reaction from inside the force, Sir Iain's popularity with the rank and file will help them accept this tough message - but Police Scotland's frontline is already under great pressure.\n\nThe force has its lowest number of officers since 2008 because of real terms budget cuts and an independent review has described frontline resources as the greatest challenge to changing its culture.\n\nThe review group said officers have \"little or no space\" to devote to reflection or training.\n\nSir Iain has acknowledged what his counterpart in the Met, Sir Mark Rowley, has refused to do.\n\nHe has said Police Scotland is guilty not just of institutional racism but also institutional discrimination. Has admitted a lot of people have been let down.\n\nSir Iain is adamant this is not a case of warm words from a chief constable who's about to walk out the door.\n\nBut it will be years before we find out whether this landmark moment has been a catalyst for real change.\n\nAn independent review group established by Police Scotland to examine its record on equality, diversity, inclusion and human rights noted the \"widespread view\" that although discriminatory attitudes are still present in the force, there had been a marked shift over the past decade.\n\nThe review also found that efforts to improve Police Scotland's culture are being held back by financial issues and pressure on frontline resources.\n\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the problems in Police Scotland were \"systemic\" and its complaints processes were \"not fit for purpose\".\n\nHe also urged the Scottish government to deliver extra resources for the force and to provide extra protection for whistleblowers who fear punishment if they raise legitimate concerns.\n\nHuman rights lawyer Aamer Anwar, who had his teeth smashed out in a racist attack by police in Glasgow in 1991, said those in policing had refused to accept institutional racism for too long.\n\nMr Anwar, who represents the family of Sheku Bayoh, said Sir Iain's statement was a \"testament to families and all those struggles fought by the victims of racial violence and injustice\".", "The National Food Crime Unit (NFCU) is investigating potential food fraud involving pre-packed sliced beef which was labelled as British but came from South America and Europe.\n\nA supermarket in the UK has been forced to remove products from its shelves.\n\nThe unit has declined to name the retailer or the supplier of the meat.\n\nAndrew Quinn, deputy chief of the NFCU, said it was not a food safety issue but a matter of food fraud, which it takes very seriously.\n\nMr Quinn said: \"The retailer was notified on the same day that we took action against the food business suspected of the fraud and immediately removed all affected products from their shelves.\n\n\"The retailer continues to work closely and cooperatively with the NFCU investigation to progress the case against the supplier. This is not a food safety issue but a matter of food fraud.\"\n\nThe BBC has contacted UK supermarkets for comment. Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda, Aldi, Lidl, the Co-op, Waitrose, Morrisons, Iceland and Marks & Spencer said they are not the retailer that had been supplied with the beef.\n\nCharlotte Di Cello, Waitrose commercial director, said: \"We know each and every farmer that produces our Waitrose beef. At Waitrose, higher welfare means higher welfare and British means British. These standards are fundamental to our makeup and this will never change.\"\n\nThe investigation - codenamed \"Operation Hawk\" - was made public in December by the Food Standards Agency, which is the parent body of the NFCU.\n\nAt the time it said it was looking into the directors of a company which sold large volumes of pre-packed meat to UK supermarket retailer \"who pride themselves on only selling British products\".\n\nHowever, it did not disclose details of the probe, including what type of meat was in question.\n\nSome trade associations told Farmers Weekly magazine, which revealed that beef was at the centre of the investigation, they were disappointed that it had taken until now for some facts to be released.\n\nA spokesman for the Association of Independent Meat Suppliers, said: \"It is only today that we have found the product concerned is beef, and it is our belief, given the popularity of sliced cooked beef across all trade channels, that its sale by food fraudsters will not have been limited to a single supermarket.\n\n\"The NFCU's current play book has the potential to damage UK overseas trade simply by their policy of a lack of transparency and industry engagement.\"\n\nThe NFCU's Mr Quinn said: \"Any fraud investigations of this nature take time to go through evidence and bring to any outcome, including any potential prosecution.\n\n\"We take food fraud very seriously and are acting urgently to protect the consumer.\"", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nTwo Olympic wrestlers have been detained by police in India during the latest protest against the alleged sexual abuse of female athletes.\n\nBajrang Punia and Sakshi Malik were among those trying to march to Delhi's new parliament on Sunday.\n\nThey were stopped by hundreds of police, who were on duty for the building's inauguration.\n\nFootage showed protesters climbing over barricades and being carried away by the authorities.\n\nTwo-time World Championship medallist Vinesh Phogat and her sister Sangeeta were also among the country's top wrestlers to be detained.\n\n\"This is wrong,\" Ms Malik told reporters after she had been placed on a bus by the authorities.\n\n\"We were walking quietly, they dragged us forcefully and detained us and they're not even telling us where we will be taken.\"\n\n\"Our people are not being allowed to march,\" said Mr Phogat, adding that the protesters \"requested with folded hands\" that police let them go and that they would go peacefully.\n\nThe incident happened as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was officially opening the new parliament nearby, which has replaced the British-era building.\n\nMost opposition parties boycotted the ceremony after criticising the government for not asking President Droupadi Murmu, who is head of state, to open it.\n\nPolice claimed the protesting wrestlers had not followed their directions and that they had detained those who had tried to break the barricades.\n\n\"They broke the law,\" Delhi's Special Commissioner of Police, Dependra Pathak told local media.\n\n\"Regarding further action, we would ascertain what rules have been violated and then take action by following due legal process.\"\n\nThe police also removed tents and other items from the site where the protesters have been camped out for weeks.\n\nTheir handling of the march has been criticised by a number of opposition politicians.\n\n\"Strongly condemn the way Delhi Police manhandled Sakshi Malik, Vinesh Phogat and other wrestlers,\" tweeted West Bengal's Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee from the All India Trinamool Congress party.\n\n\"It's shameful our champions are treated in this manner.\"\n\nDelhi's Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who is from the Aam Aadmi Party, called the police's behaviour \"very wrong and condemnable\".\n\nMs Malik - the first Indian woman to win an Olympic wrestling medal in 2016 - later tweeted that once she and her fellow protesters were released they would begin their \"satyagraha\", a form of non-violent resistance, again.\n\nThe demonstrators accuse wrestling officials of sexually harassing women in the sport. That includes the head of its governing body, Brij Bhushan Singh, who denies the claims.\n\nTheir protests began in January but were called off the same month after Mr Singh was stripped of his administrative powers by the sports ministry and the government promised to investigate their complaints.\n\nThe Indian Olympic Association set up a committee to investigate the allegations against Mr Singh, which submitted its report weeks ago. The committee's findings haven't been revealed yet.\n\nPolice in Delhi were also on guard on Sunday as a group of farmers tried to enter the city to support the wrestlers.

The next strike will be on Tuesday.\n\nBut the three other unions, including two for head teachers, are asking their members whether they want to strike.\n\nThe government said co-ordinated action would be \"unreasonable\".\n\nThe four unions teaming up in the dispute are the NEU, the NASUWT, the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) and the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL).\n\nPaul Whiteman, NAHT general secretary, called their decision to co-ordinate action an \"unprecedented show of solidarity\".\n\nJoined-up strike action - if it were to happen - would affect every state school in England, according to Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the NEU.\n\nBetween 300,000 and 400,000 teachers could be involved, he said during a joint press conference at the NAHT conference in Telford.\n\n\"We would sincerely apologise to parents for disrupting their children's education if we're pushed to that,\" he added.\n\nMany teachers are about to be asked for a second time whether they want to strike.\n\nThree of the unions have already held ballots this year. However, when the results were announced in January, only the NEU had enough members voting to move ahead to strikes.\n\nNEU walkouts have been held since February, and it is about to reballot its members - asking them whether they would want to continue strike action into next term.\n\nThe NASUWT union and the NAHT did not meet the turnout threshold needed to strike in England in their last ballots - but both are due to reballot their members ahead of next term.\n\nThe fourth union, ASCL, is due to ballot members for the first time in its history.\n\nShadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson said the issue was caused by \"failure on the part of the government to be serious about negotiating\", adding that the joint strike action \"demonstrates the scale of the anger and the scale of the dissatisfaction\" among teachers.\n\nMore than half of England's 22,000 schools either closed or partially closed on NEU strike days in February and March.\n\nIf members from several unions, including head teachers, were to walk out together, it is likely there would be more full school closures.\n\nA Department for Education spokeswoman said: \"For unions to co-ordinate strike action with the aim of causing maximum disruption to schools is unreasonable and disproportionate, especially given the impact the pandemic has already had on their learning.\"\n\nThe joint announcement comes after the NAHT announced it would be reballoting members on pay, funding, workload and wellbeing.\n\nKatie Chilvers, a Year one teacher in Birmingham, supports the NEU strike action and has walked out this year.\n\nKatie Chilvers said she has been using social media to support the cause rather than striking\n\nBut she did not take part in the latest strike on Thursday because she could not \"justify\" losing another day's pay.\n\n\"We're looking at around \u00a380 a day that we'd lose out on, on average,\" she said.\n\nShe said she was finding other ways to support the cause, such as \"spreading the word\" on social media.\n\nThe NEU says members can apply to access hardship funds.\n\nMost state school teachers in England had a 5% rise in 2022, and a 3% rise was recommended from September 2023.\n\nBut the unions want above-inflation increases, and extra money to ensure any pay rises do not come from schools' existing budgets.\n\nAfter the February strikes, the government made a new pay offer for school teachers, which included a \u00a31,000 one-off payment this year and a 4.3% pay rise for most staff in September.\n\nThe starting salary for teachers in England is also due to rise to \u00a330,000 a year by September - a previous government commitment.\n\nThe Department for Education described it as a \"fair and reasonable offer\" and said that schools would receive an extra \u00a32.3bn over the next two years.\n\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said in December that the increased funding would mean that school spending per pupil \"will grow in real terms through to 2024 and will return to at least 2010 levels\".\n\nAll four unions rejected the offer. They said it was still not fully funded, meaning schools would have had to make cuts elsewhere to afford it.\n\nEducation Secretary Gillian Keegan said the offer was no longer on the table, so the decision on pay would now be made by the independent pay review body.\n\nAre you a parent of children who are affected?

I hoped I might meet him one day to tell him what an inspiration he was to me: I loved [how] gloriously loose and effortless his shows were, how he proved you could be political in a light entertainment space and that you could do all this and be really, really funny.\"\n\nO'Grady's husband Andre Portasio, pictured at the National Television Awards in 2019, said the entertainer had died \"unexpectedly but peacefully\" on Tuesday evening\n\nOne of O'Grady's most recent TV appearances came last year with Camilla, the Queen Consort, for a one-off episode of ITV's For The Love of Dogs - a series the star helped launch in 2012 that followed the work of the Battersea Dogs and Cats Home, an organisation for which he was an ambassador.\n\nA statement released on behalf of Camilla on Wednesday said she was \"deeply saddened to have learned of the death of Paul O'Grady, with whom she worked closely to support the work of Battersea Dogs and Cats Home and whose warm heart and infectious humour lit up the lives of so many\".\n\nFollowing his death, the animal home remembered O'Grady as a \"devoted animal lover\" and a \"champion for the underdog\".\n\nQI host Sandi Toksvig said: \"Working with Paul O'Grady was one of the greatest pleasures of my life.

I know he was so loved by the Radio 2 listeners and all of us here.\"\n\nO'Grady received an honorary fellowship from Liverpool John Moores University for services to entertainment in 2005\n\nTop Gear host McGuiness said that O'Grady, for whom he stood in on his chat show more than 15 years ago, \"was always supportive, kind and just great to be around\".\n\n\"Paul started in the pubs and working men's clubs but finished as an icon of British TV. I'll miss him very much.\"\n\nFormer BBC Radio 2 presenter Ken Bruce described O'Grady as a \"unique and brilliant broadcaster who brightened the nation\".\n\nDrag queen Danny Beard told BBC Breakfast that the star was \"the most important person in British culture for drag\".\n\n\"I don't think there's anyone who does the job that I do that doesn't class Paul as an icon,\" added Beard, who won series four of Ru Paul's Drag Race UK.\n\nPaul O'Grady was also well known as his drag queen alter-ego Lily Savage\n\nWhenever we talk about on-screen representation, there's a saying; \"If you can't see it, you can't be it.\"\n\nAnd as tributes to Paul O'Grady pour in, it's clear the saying has never been more appropriate.\n\nHe played pubs and clubs as rough-around-the-edges drag queen Lily savage in the 80s, and brought the character to the mainstream in the 90s.\n\nBut it was what Paul did next - and how he did it - that made him a trailblazer for gay representation on screen and inspired a whole generation of entertainers that might not ever have thought it possible.\n\nAs Britain emerged from the AIDs crisis, with homophobia and stigma still rife, Paul managed to become a staple of prime-time light entertainment; not just as Lily, but as himself. A working class gay man from Birkenhead.\n\nHe never assimilated. He never attempted to \"straighten up\" or change his persona.\n\nAnd for so many in the LGBT community - who are used to making ourselves smaller or hiding parts of our personality in certain company - that was a game changer.\n\nFrom documentaries, to his own chat shows, the Blind Date reboot and of course his ITV show Love of Dogs, he never dimmed himself down or tried to make himself more palatable for certain audiences.\n\nHe was unapologetically camp, and bitchy. He was Paul - perhaps, though, always with a hint of Lily\u2026\n\nO'Grady was also mentioned by several MPs during Wednesday's Prime Minister's Questions.\n\nLabour's deputy leader Angela Rayner and MP Chris Bryant both paid tribute to the entertainer, while deputy prime minister Dominic Raab said Lily Savage \"broke glass ceilings and broke boundaries\".\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

He truly elevated the very atmosphere in which he moved. God rest his mighty soul.\"\n\nPresenter and actor Les Dennis described O'Grady as \"a true comedy great\", adding: \"His twinkly, mischievous presence will be missed by so many.\"\n\nActor and TV host Rob Brydon said: \"Paul O'Grady was a lovely warm and caring man with a lightning fast and devastating wit.

He was a massive talent, but you can't forget he was a social worker when he was younger, he saved babies and young children from abuse, he lived in Soho before it was gentrified, he never judged the vulnerable, the weak, the misunderstood.\"\n\nO'Grady had recently been on tour playing Miss Hannigan in the musical Annie and had been due to present on Boom Radio in less than two weeks time for Easter Sunday.\n\nO'Grady won trophies at the TV Baftas and National Television Awards during his career\n\nThe presenter was born in Birkenhead, on the Wirral, Merseyside, in 1955, to a mother whose maiden name was Savage - which is believed to have inspired his famous drag act.\n\nHe began performing as Lily Savage in the 1970s. His drag persona later helmed in a solo show that ran for eight years at London's Royal Vauxhall Tavern, and made a name by speaking out about LGBT issues.\n\nLater, he hosted chat show The Lily Savage Show for BBC for a short run in 1997, before turning his hand to hosting a revived version of game show Blankety Blank, which remained on air until 2002.\n\nO'Grady later hosted teatime programme The Paul O'Grady Show on ITV from 2004 to 2005, before moving with it to Channel 4 from 2006 until 2009. It was later revived in 2013 on ITV and remained on air for two years.\n\nDuring 2013, the chat show was fronted by guest hosts after he suffered a health scare. He had previously had heart attacks in 2002 and 2006, the latter requiring a stay in intensive care.\n\nDuring his career O'Grady won a TV Bafta, British Comedy Award and a National Television Award for The Paul O'Grady Show.\n\nIn 2008, he was made an MBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours for services to entertainment.", "Boris Johnson will publish evidence in his defence ahead of a grilling by MPs over whether he misled Parliament about Covid rule-breaking parties.\n\nThe former prime minister faces a crucial televised evidence session in front of the Commons Privileges Committee on Wednesday.\n\nThe committee is yet to publish its final verdict - but its initial update earlier this month said Mr Johnson may have misled Parliament multiple times.\n\nWednesday's session, which could last up to five hours, will be a key chance for Mr Johnson to persuade the seven cross-party MPs who make up the committee that he did not mislead MPs in December 2021.\n\nThat would include when he told the Commons that he had \"been repeatedly assured since these allegations emerged that there was no party and that no Covid rules were broken\".\n\nSources close to Mr Johnson say he will publish a \"compelling dossier\" that will provide evidence and arguments that he did not knowingly mislead parliament.\n\nIf he fails to convince the committee and is found guilty, he could be suspended from the Commons, and even faces a recall petition, which would trigger a by-election, if that suspension is for more than 10 days.\n\nCrucially, though, MPs would have to approve any sanction on Mr Johnson.\n\nIn May last year, an inquiry by senior civil servant Sue Gray found widespread rule-breaking had taken place, and Mr Johnson was among 83 people fined by police for attending law-breaking events.\n\nThe Sunday Times, Observer and Sunday Telegraph report that Mr Johnson's \"dossier\" will include advice he claims he was given at the time by No 10 aides, advising him that Covid rules were not broken.\n\nThe Sunday Times quotes one source saying the messages show \"in black and white\" that what Mr Johnson told Parliament was what he had been advised to say by officials and his No 10 team, claiming he was forced to rely on advice because he was not at some of the events.\n\nCabinet minister Oliver Dowden - who served in Mr Johnson's government - told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg on Sunday programme he expected the former prime minister to \"put forward a robust defence of his conduct\".\n\nThe newspapers also report that Mr Johnson's defence may repeat allegations of bias levelled at the former top civil servant Sue Gray, whose inquiry found widespread rule-breaking had taken place in Whitehall during Covid.\n\nSue Gray produced a highly critical report into lockdown parties under Boris Johnson that contributed to his downfall as PM\n\nSue Gray has since resigned and has been offered a job as Sir Keir Starmer's chief of staff, which caused anger among allies of Boris Johnson including his former cabinet colleagues Jacob Rees-Mogg MP and Nadine Dorries MP.\n\nThe Labour Party has said it will give all the information related to its approach to her to the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (ACOBA) - the government's appointments watchdog.\n\nBut minister Jeremy Quin has said her proposed move may have breached Whitehall's rules, as approval must be obtained prior to a job offer being announced.\n\nDowning Street sources say any sanctions against Mr Johnson would be a matter for the House of Commons and MPs will therefore be given a free vote - meaning they will not be \"whipped\" to vote a certain way.\n\nThat means Tory MPs would not be asked to vote one way or another, as they were over the proposed suspension of Owen Paterson in November 2021, when Mr Johnson was still prime minister.\n\nThe government tried to block Mr Paterson's suspension from the Commons but, after a backlash, was later forced to U-turn. He then resigned as an MP.\n\nAt the time, Mr Johnson came in for criticism from many of his own MPs about being told to back Mr Paterson, amid Labour accusations of \"sleaze\". The first Partygate stories broke only a few weeks later.\n\nThe Paterson row was the beginning of the end for Mr Johnson's time as prime minister, and Mr Johnson later admitted he \"crashed the car\" in his handling of the case.\n\nA spokesman for Mr Johnson said: \"The Privileges Committee will vindicate Boris Johnson's position.\n\n\"The evidence will show that Boris Johnson did not knowingly mislead parliament.\"", "Police say the death of Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor is not being treated as suspicious, following the discovery of her body on Wednesday.\n\nThe Irish singer and activist, 56, best known for the song Nothing Compares 2 U, was found at her home in Herne Hill, south London at 11:18 BST.\n\nPolice say she was \"unresponsive\" and \"pronounced dead at the scene\".\n\nLondon Inner South Coroner's Court said no medical cause of death was given and an post-mortem will be conducted.\n\nThe results could take \"several weeks\" and a decision on whether an inquest will be needed will be decided when they are are known, the court added.\n\nO'Connor's family announced the news of her death on Wednesday evening \"with great sadness\", saying \"her family and friends are devastated\".\n\nShe will be remembered for many political statements, including in 1992 when she controversially ripped up a picture of Pope John Paul II during a performance on US TV show Saturday Night Live.\n\nShredding the picture, which she removed from a frame in her mother's home after her death, was a protest against child sexual abuse in the Catholic Church.\n\nTributes have been pouring in for the Brit and Grammy Award-winning artist, including from singer Annie Lennox , who shared a poetic tribute to O'Connor, calling her \"fierce and fragile... impulsive, bold and beautiful... with an incredible voice\".\n\n\"May the angels hold you in their tender arms and give you rest,\" she added.\n\nThe Pretenders' singer Chrissie Hynde told BBC Radio 2: \"She was a really fun person, she was such a riot to hang out with.\n\n\"But she was always angling to stir it up - she really poked the hornets' nest, and [was] certainly a one-off and a huge talent.

Everyone feels part of it. Even the fans when they go to the stadium, they feel part of this club.\n\n\"He would have loved to play for the first team. I could make it, so he is so proud of me as well and he is so happy if we can do something important this season.\"\n\nThe 34-year-old watches Zaragoza when he can as well as United, a club he will \"love forever\", and PSG, who allowed him to \"play with some of the best players in the history of football\".\n\nBut when it comes to a club's role in society, he says Athletic - with their Basque-only policy - are \"most important\".\n\n\"You see people who have been season ticket holders all their lives and they don't watch other games, they only watch Athletic, that is so different,\" he says.\n\n\"Something I really like from our region and our people is that we love what we do and we love what we have, even though we know probably it is not the best in the world, but we love it more than anything else.\"\n\nHerrera played under Ernesto Valverde in the final season of his first spell at San Mames, qualifying for the Champions League.\n\nBoth have since gone elsewhere - Herrera to United and PSG, Valverde to Barcelona - but back together again they have another chance to reach Europe's elite competition, and sit fifth in La Liga.\n\n\"We are doing great, for me Ernesto is one of the best coaches in the world because he adapts and is so smart with the qualities that he has from his team,\" says Herrera.\n\n\"First period here we didn't have as much speed as we have now, so we had a more controlled team, we used to control the games more and have more possession, positional football.\n\n\"Now with the players we have got he finds more of the space, he finds more what I say rock'n'roll football, an attacking team trying to get the opponent exhausted and don't give them time to recover, to breathe.\"\n\nSo would Herrera be keen to follow him into the dugout?\n\n\"We think about it when you get older in football,\" he says. \"I am still 34 and still have energy to keep playing and I love football, but of course you start thinking about your next chapter.\n\n\"I will continue in football for sure, because it is my life, it is my passion, I love football, I love what I do. But you never know where.\n\n\"If you see the coaches, the managers, it is so hard, sometimes it is so unfair, their job. You can be fantastic every week, working, they prepare everything, they spend the whole week preparing the game and after you hit the post and you don't score they are out.\n\n\"That's why I am not convinced to be a coach one day, because I think it's a very unfair job. As we say in Spanish, I don't close those doors, but you never know.\"", "The Labour MP said she was left feeling humiliated\n\nAn MP has said she was left \"humiliated\" when she was subjected to a social services investigation after a complaint from an internet troll.\n\nThe probe was launched after a man complained to Leicestershire Police that Stella Creasy's children should be taken into care.\n\nThe Labour MP told Today on BBC Radio 4 he made the complaint as he disagreed with her campaign against misogyny.\n\nWaltham Forest Council decided no action was needed against her.\n\nThe Walthamstow MP told the Today programme the man, from Leicester, had initially emailed her office angry about the work she was doing to tackle violence against women.\n\nShe ignored them as she gets \"a lot of emails like that, lots of MPs do and you think people are entitled to their opinion\".\n\nShe then received a call from social services informing her they had held a safeguarding investigation over an allegation her children were at \"direct risk\".\n\nThey then told her they thought she was the person who may be at risk \"because of the way in which this person is targeting me\", she said, adding social services wanted to know how to raise concerns about her safety with the parliamentary policing system.\n\n\"I was horrified and humiliated,\" she said.\n\n\"My children now have a social services record and it sets the green light that in public life, you can target these children. I think most people would think that's unacceptable.\"\n\nThe council said it launched the investigation as it was legally required to following the referral from Leicestershire Police.\n\nA panel, which was made up of social workers, then met to discuss the case.\n\nAlthough the panel decided no action was needed, it is legally prevented from removing the complaint from its record.\n\nThe MP said she was told the complainant would not face criminal sanctions as he was \"entitled\" to his view her children should be taken into care.\n\nLeicestershire Police said it had investigated a \"number of emails\" sent to the MP and gave the man a community resolution rather than a formal sanction because the messages did not meet the threshold for a criminal offence.\n\nIt said the content of the messages had \"understandably caused upset and distress\" to the MP and officers had spoken to the sender who admitted he was responsible and apologised.\n\nMs Creasy said she was not \"pushing for a prosecution\" but for a caution as that would have meant the details would have gone into the police intelligence database.\n\n\"Having worked on harassment legislation myself, the irony is not lost on me that one of the challenges we've been trying to raise in tackling harassment against women, is the attitude of the police and that's exactly what I experienced,\" she said.\n\nMs Creasy added she was \"passionate about safeguarding\" and \"we can't have the system corrupted in this way\".\n\nThe MP is a prominent campaigner for women's rights\n\nThe MP also voiced concerns that instances like this were \"damaging the whole of public life\".\n\nShe said MPs did not want to be \"put into glass cages\" but this was \"the reason why a lot of women are put off\" standing to be an MP as it is \"women who are targeted\".\n\n\"It's not a matter of free speech, the police acted as if his free speech to argue without any evidence at all - he'd never met me, seen my children, he'd never been in a room with us; he simply disagreed with my views.\n\n\"That can't stand in a thriving democracy because it's going to drive people out of it.\"\n\nThe force said it had told the complainant to not contact Ms Creasy and there had been no report of further unwanted contact.\n\nA spokesman said: \"Leicestershire Police takes any report of harassment extremely seriously and will carry out a full investigation into the report and take the appropriate action.\n\n\"The force remains fully committed to keeping women and girls safe, listening to concerns and tackling violence.\"\n\nAccording to the Sentencing Council, a community resolution is an \"informal, non-statutory disposal used for dealing with less serious crime and anti-social behaviour where the offender accepts responsibility\".\n\n\"The views of the victim are taken into account in reaching an informal agreement between the parties which can involve restorative justice techniques,\" it adds.\n\nWaltham Forest Council said: \"All safeguarding allegations are dealt with in line with the national legislation.

Italy is the largest single recipient of the fund.\n\nThe EPPO has 1,927 investigations in progress, involving suspected fraud worth \u20ac19.2bn (\u00a316.5bn), according to its 2023 annual report.\n\nBy the end of last year, some 206 of these investigations were into fraud relating to the EU's post-Covid funding projects.", "International summits are a curious mix of the theatrical, diplomatic and administrative.\n\nThey are a huge undertaking, with massive security.\n\nLittle wonder - a collection of world leaders, in the same place, at the same time, at a long-before advertised event.\n\nAnd so the skies swarm with helicopters and the streets swarm with lanyard-wearing attendees, clutching their all-important accreditation for fear that, without it, even crossing the road might prove impossible.\n\nI spotted two of my colleagues in the travelling British press pack out on a jog the other day, in the driving rain - shorts and T shirts on, yellow G7 lanyards still hanging around their necks.\n\nPity the poor residents of the host city suddenly unable to take their normal route to work or wherever, because of road closures.\n\nThen there is the theatre.\n\nAt the heart of politics are people. Personal relationships matter in politics and diplomacy just as they do in any other walk of life.\n\nAnd politicians, in particular, have audiences back home to address, images to burnish and impressions to leave.\n\nSo there are the theatrical moments, such as Rishi Sunak wearing the red socks - costing \u00a38 we were told - of the Hiroshima Toyo Carp baseball team, whose fans include the host of the summit, the Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.\n\nThis might seem trivial, and is a little theatrical - but it also has a value beyond the pictures.\n\nThe relationships international leaders have are so often very brief - one or the other leaves office, and along comes a successor - so acts that help establish and deepen those personal relationships have a real value.\n\nThen, there is the diplomacy.\n\nWinning friends and influencing people? The PM gets a selfie with other world leaders\n\nIn the weeks and months before a summit, diplomats for each country discuss their own outlooks and those of others, to try to find common ground.\n\nThese diplomats are known as \"sherpas\" - they lead the way to the summit\u2026\n\nTalking to those who have done just that for the UK, you get a sense of just how much work this is.\n\nThe subtleties, the nuances, the different emphases of different countries, on a huge range of issues - and changing all the time.\n\nThe political leaders then head to the summit.\n\nIn this instance, the PM had been in Iceland the day before setting off for Japan. He got back to Downing Street from Rekjavik at 2am.\n\nThe flight to Hiroshima, via Almaty in Kazakhstan, set off from Stansted in Essex at 9am.\n\nWe landed in Tokyo at 9am Japanese time the next day, 16 hours later, with a full day ahead.\n\nBy the end of the day we had made it to Hiroshima.\n\nWhen the political leaders come together there is a marathon series of talks, both in big groups, and in one-on-ones known as \"bilaterals\".\n\nAt the end, usually, emerges what is called a communique - the agreed conclusions.\n\nOften broad, often vague, they attempt to take account of every country's position, emphasis and focus on various issues, with the aim being that ongoing discussions can build upon them.\n\nAt this summit the communique came early, the day before the end.\n\nThere wasn't as much wrangling or even chaos that can occasionally happen.\n\nAnd then finally, a round of news conferences - an opening statement from leaders, followed by questions, often on a wide range of topics.\n\nI asked the PM about the big political story of the day - the Mail on Sunday and Sunday Times storyabout the home secretary's actions after being caught speeding last year.\n\nHe was clearly irritated to be immediately confronted by the conduct of one of his ministers after several long days of international diplomacy.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. \"Did you have any questions about the summit?\" Rishi Sunak asks the BBC's Chris Mason\n\nLittle wonder: sleep deprivation, jet lag, complex international deliberations - and then here come (entirely unsurprising) questions about a row back home.\n\nThe answer I was given amounted to a holding position: the PM and home secretary hadn't yet spoken about it.\n\nThere was no endorsement of Braverman - but no referral to the Independent Adviser on Ministers' Interests either.\n\nIncidentally, we already know Sunak's view on Braverman breaching the ministerial code before he was PM, because he reappointed her as home secretary after she had done just that and resigned.\n\nBut it is striking that Downing Street sources are letting it be known that the PM had no idea until the story broke last night about the home secretary's speeding offence, or her request for help from civil servants with its consequences.\n\nHe was, I'm told, not informed about it by the Cabinet Office or the Home Office.\n\nNo 10 is making it clear that the home secretary hadn't told him, and neither had the Whitehall machine, the civil service.\n\nIt is striking too that this story should come via two newspapers, not one, just days after a speech by Braverman that read rather like a future leadership bid.\n\nThe story also comes ahead of the publication of new net migration statistics on Thursday.\n\nNumbers are expected to reach a record high, a subject about which Braverman has articulated strong views both publicly and privately within government.\n\nIt doesn't appear the government's planned changes to student visas - in particular restrictions on those entitled to bring dependents - will be announced quite yet.\n\nAs for summits, there is a Nato one in Lithuania in the summer, and then the G20 in Delhi in September.\n\nWhat a moment that will be for the PM, and indeed his wife Akshata Murty, were she to choose to accompany her husband once again as she did to Hiroshima.\n\nShe was born and grew up in India. He is of Indian heritage himself.", "Nicola Sturgeon was synonymous with the SNP, but is now facing calls to quit the party she once led\n\nFirst Minister Humza Yousaf has rejected calls to suspend Nicola Sturgeon from the SNP after his predecessor was arrested as part of a police probe of party finances.\n\nMs Sturgeon was released without charge and insists she is innocent, but has faced calls from opposition parties and some SNP politicians to step back from her party membership while the investigation continues.\n\nThis inquiry has taken the SNP into uncharted territory after years of stability at the top of Scottish politics, but there have been questions over the membership of some parliamentarians in the past.\n\nWhat precedent will Mr Yousaf and Ms Sturgeon have to lean upon as they weigh up her future in the SNP?\n\nColin Beattie quit as SNP treasurer, but continues to represent the party on the back benches at Holyrood\n\nThe most immediate examples come from the same police investigation into party fundraising and finances, which has seen two other senior SNP figures arrested and released without charge.\n\nThe first was Peter Murrell, the party's former chief executive and Ms Sturgeon's husband - the arrest which sparked a two-day search of the couple's home in Glasgow. Mr Yousaf rejected calls for him to be suspended because he is \"innocent until proven guilty\".\n\nMeanwhile Colin Beattie opted to step down as SNP Treasurer, but has stayed on as an SNP MSP - with Mr Yousaf saying \"it is really important that due process takes place\".\n\nThe first minister has leaned on these two examples as his reasoning for not suspending Ms Sturgeon, saying he has been consistent in his decisions.\n\nAlex Salmond once said he would return to the SNP after clearing his name, but now runs the rival Alba Party\n\nBut under Ms Sturgeon's leadership, there was a broad range of examples where MPs and MSPs resigned or were suspended from the SNP - which obviously cover quite different circumstances to her own.\n\nHer predecessor Alex Salmond resigned his membership when he was accused of harassment, stepping back from the party while he took the government he once led to court over its investigation.\n\nHe said he intended to rejoin the SNP once he had cleared his name, but instead set up his own Alba Party after being cleared of sexual assault charges in a criminal trial.\n\nNatalie McGarry voluntarily withdrew from the SNP whip at Westminster before being convicted of embezzlement\n\nOthers have also opted to resign or voluntarily \"step back\" from the party whip or membership.\n\nNatalie McGarry withdrew from the SNP whip at Westminster in 2015 - just months after being elected - amid a fraud investigation.\n\nAt the time, Ms Sturgeon said that was \"the right thing to have done\", although she added that Ms McGarry was \"entitled to the presumption of innocence\".\n\nShe left Westminster at the 2017 election, and was ultimately jailed for embezzlement.\n\nMichelle Thomson has called for Nicola Sturgeon to step back from the SNP, having been pushed out herself in 2015\n\nResignations are not always entirely voluntary though.\n\nMichelle Thomson resigned the whip at Westminster in 2015 amid allegations of financial impropriety which ultimately led to nothing, with prosecutors announcing two years later that there was an \"absence of sufficient credible and reliable evidence\" against her.\n\nShe said she wanted to stay in the party, but was told it was \"a case of go or be pushed\" by senior figures in the party.\n\nIn a telling sequence of events, she published a statement saying she would co-operate fully with police - one minute before the party released the same statement, but with an additional line saying she had \"decided to withdraw from the party whip\".\n\nThe fact she was left sitting as an independent MP meant she was unable to stand for the SNP in the snap election in 2017, and lost her seat - although she has since been readmitted to the party and is now an MSP at Holyrood.\n\nMs Thomson has called for Ms Sturgeon to resign the party whip while she is under investigation, saying \"her values should be consistent\".\n\nMargaret Ferrier was suspended from the SNP and faced calls to quit as an MP after breaching Covid rules\n\nOthers have been directly suspended by the party, without being given the option of jumping before they are pushed.\n\nThe MP Margaret Ferrier was suspended after admitting she had breached Covid lockdown restrictions, and Ms Sturgeon urged her to quit parliament entirely.\n\nShe sits as an independent MP but has now been suspended from the House of Commons too, meaning she faces the prospect of losing her Rutherglen and Hamilton West seat via a recall petition.\n\nAt Holyrood, the MSP Mark McDonald was suspended from the party amid harassment allegations which saw him quit as a government minister.\n\nAfter serving a month-long suspension from parliament he saw out the term as an independent MSP, having quit the party ahead of a group meeting where his SNP membership was to be debated.\n\nThe MP Chris Law has pointed out that he was detained by police as part of an investigation without ever being suspended from the SNP\n\nOne of the stranger cases was that of Neale Hanvey, who was suspended from the party midway through the 2019 general election campaign after making a \"clearly unacceptable\" post on social media.\n\nAlthough technically an independent candidate, the ballot papers in Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath had already been printed with the SNP logo next to his name - and he went on to take the seat from Labour's shadow Scottish secretary.\n\nMr Hanvey was readmitted to the party in May 2020, but less than a year later he resigned to join the newly-formed Alba Party.\n\nTo complete the broadest possible range of potential outcomes, the SNP MP Chris Law has pointed out that he was detained by police in 2016 as part of a financial investigation.\n\nThe Dundee West MP was questioned by officers about his Spirit of Independence campaign, but was released without charge.\n\nHe was not suspended from the party and was backed by the party leadership, and now says remaining in post \"should be the right course for anyone that is in that position\".", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nParts of the US are expected to see record temperatures on Sunday, with warnings of \"dangerous\" heat levels into next week across the south-west.\n\nNearly a third of Americans -

one of the hottest places in the world - is forecast to reach 129F (54C), nearing the hottest temperatures ever reliably recorded on Earth.\n\nThe NWS has said that local records could also be set on Sunday in the San Joaquin Valley, Mojave Desert, and Great Basin regions.\n\nIts Saturday-evening update said the temperatures would \"pose a health risk and are potentially deadly to anyone without effective cooling and/or adequate hydration\".\n\nAbout 700 people are estimated to die each year from heat-related causes in the US, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nEnergy consumption in Texas has surpassed records, as many in the state scramble to stay cool.\n\nIn neighbouring Canada, officials say wildfires stoked by above-average temperatures - which have covered parts of the US in smoke - have now burned nearly 10 million hectares (25 million acres) of land.\n\nThe temperatures in America's south-west are the result of an upper level ridge of high pressure, which typically brings with it warmer temperatures, the NWS said earlier, adding that the heatwave was \"one of the strongest\" systems of its kind to hit the region.\n\nLas Vegas, Nevada, may also match its all-time high of 117F (47C) in the next few days.\n\nWeather officials there warned locals who thought they could handle the temperatures that this was \"not your typical desert heat\".\n\n\"'It's the desert, of course it's hot'- This is a DANGEROUS mind set!\", the NWS in Las Vegas tweeted.\n\n\"This heatwave is NOT typical desert heat due to its long duration, extreme daytime temperatures, & warm nights.

They're scared that if they let go of it, they're not going to create decent art - but suffering is just one colour on the wheel.\n\n\"It can definitely be inspiring, but some of my favourite songs come from when I'm genuinely peaceful and really happy.\"\n\nMusgraves was born in the tiny town of Golden, Texas, and has been making music since she first picked up a mandolin at the age of eight.\n\nAs a child, she was a champion yodeller, and sang the national anthem at the 2002 Winter Olympics - but it was her songwriting that really caught people's attention.\n\nIn her teens, her parents paid for her to record three independent albums, while her grandmother worked as a live agent, calling up venues and telling them they just had to hear her granddaughter's voice.\n\nThe singer's first three albums - all self-released - are now hard to track down\n\nAfter high school, Musgraves moved to Austin and became a working songwriter, supplying tracks for the TV show Nashville and supplementing her income by dressing up as Cinderella and painting kids' faces at birthday parties.\n\nThen, in 2012, one of her songs, Mama's Broken Heart, was recorded by Miranda Lambert and reached number two on the US country charts.\n\nThe success helped her secure a record deal of her own, and her major-label debut, Same Trailer, Different Park, went on to win the Grammy Award for best country album.\n\nEven then, she was testing the boundaries of country music - singing about drug use and small-town hypocrisy, despite the advice of her record label boss to tone the lyrics down.\n\n\"He literally said, 'You know, Kacey, sometimes in business you just gotta do some things you're not proud of,'\" she told fans at a listening event earlier this month. \"I said, 'I don't want to play it safe... I don't respect that at all'.\"\n\nThe attitude paid off. A liberal star in the conservative world of country, Musgraves has attracted fans who'd previously felt alienated by the genre; and won over pop audiences by touring with Harry Styles and writing campy disco anthems like High Horse and the blissed-out love song Oh, What A World.\n\nBoth songs featured on the breakthrough Golden Hour album, which was written as she fell for her then-husband, Ruston Kelly - who she says opened her mind \"to a kind of love I never really envisioned for myself\".\n\nThe star won three Grammys, including album of the year, in 2019\n\nWhen the Grammys named it album of the year, Musgraves looked bewildered. \"What?\" she declared over and over again, clutching her purse to her chest.\n\nBut unexpected as it was, the award changed her outlook.\n\n\"When you win something like that, you can go one of two ways. You can develop a scarcity mindset of, 'Oh my God, everything else I do after this has to achieve the same thing or I'll see it as a failure'. Or you can look at it as validation for following no compass other than your own.\n\n\"I sort of went in the latter direction. I would rather someone says, 'OK, this album's not really for me, I'll catch her on the next record', than try to remake Golden Hour eight times.\"\n\nStar-Crossed fitted that brief almost too well. Sequenced as a Greek tragedy, it chronicled the end of her marriage, and was often as confusing as the emotions it tried to capture.\n\nMusgraves leaned further into 21st Century pop production, employing auto-tune and synthy electronics; but the good songs (Breadwinner, Camera Roll) were outnumbered by ones that failed to connect.\n\n\"It was the record it needed to be and if it wasn't everyone's favourite, I really don't care because it was enjoyable for me to make,\" she reflects.\n\nThe singer says her old songs are so familiar she could play them \"upside down, blindfolded, backwards in water\"\n\nSome critics have framed Deeper Well as a \"back-to-basics\" reset after Star-Crossed's muted reception - but the slower pace and the stripped-back instrumentation are simply reflective of her state of mind.\n\nAfter clearing the clutter of her personal life, she turned to meditation and micro-dosing psilocybin to unburden her mind. The star is now at a stage of life where she'd rather get up to see the sunrise, or take a walk with a friend, than stay up all night partying.\n\nA simpler existence calls for simpler music and, working in the cosy attic space of Jimi Hendrix's Electric Lady studios, Musgraves began to chisel away at her ideas.\n\n\"I like adding too much and then slowly clearing the space away until it hits that perfect balance of negative space and decoration,\" she says.\n\n\"Even when it comes to the lyrics, my favourite kind of writing is the most conversational, the most ordinary, the most plain.\n\n\"I'm always trying to challenge myself to pare it down even more. I get my initial idea on the paper, and it might be sort of clunky and then I refine and refine until it gets as simple as possible - so that it sounds exactly like you would say it to the person sitting in front of you.\"\n\nDeeper Well deliberately has a more \"muted palette\" than its predecessors, Musgraves says\n\nBut not all of the songs were created this way. One of the album's highlights is The Architect, in which Musgraves takes stock of the world around her and ponders the existence of God.\n\nA pensive and searching waltz, it was prompted by the horrific Covenant School shooting in Nashville last March, which left six dead.\n\nMusgraves was in the studio with her collaborators Shane McAnally and Josh Osborne at the time, \"and it felt silly, to be honest, trying to write a write a song while there were parents grieving their children within a five-mile radius\".\n\nThe tragedy prompted a debate about the existence of God in a world where such a senseless loss of life could happen.\n\n\"I would like to think that the Universe has a flow to it, but when something like that happens, it's just so perplexing. If there is a point to any of this, why are all these people suffering?\" she says.\n\nAs the musicians talked, Musgraves glanced at the apple she was holding, and it seemed even more absurd. Who would create something \"so beautiful and perfect\" then allow children to die?\n\n\"And Josh goes, 'Yeah, can I speak to the architect? What's going on here?'\"\n\nIt's a question that Musgraves, for all her newfound tranquillity, still wrestles with.\n\n\"Is there a plan? Is there a blueprint? Or is this all just completely random and we're dropped into a bucket and shaken up every day at random?\"\n\nSome of Deeper Well's most entrancing songs find Musgraves opening up to love again after her divorce, and considering her subsequent relationship with poet Cole Schafer.\n\nAlthough the couple parted ways last November, she still believes in love as the Universe's ultimate power.\n\n\"It's so palpable,\" she says. \"People entirely change the course of a bloodline by falling in love. It's this invisible force that keeps things moving throughout time.\n\n\"That's what I would say God is, if someone asked me.\"\n\nKacey Musgraves' album is out now.

That's a job I'd like. But I'm also loving the job I do now.\"\n\nDespite his obvious enthusiasm to succeed Mr Stoltenberg as the next head of Nato, he appears to have failed to get the backing of key allies.\n\nUS President Joe Biden described Mr Wallace as \"very qualified\" for the job when he met Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in Washington recently.\n\nBut in private, the US is believed to be one of the nations trying to persuade Mr Stoltenberg to stay - at least for another year. This was echoed by Mr Wallace in comments to The Economist.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has re-focused diplomatic attention on Nato's role in the 21st Century and whether it can deter Russian aggression.\n\nMr Wallace proved popular with a number of countries on the alliance's eastern flank because of his leadership in supplying weapons to Ukraine.\n\nBut others have argued for continuity in a time of war, or that the job should be reserved for a former head of government.\n\nMr Stoltenberg, who has been the alliance's top boss for nine years, has neither confirmed or denied his intentions to continue in the job.\n\nHe told reporters last week: \"I am responsible for all decisions that this alliance has to take except for one. And that is about my future. That is for the 31 allies to decide.\"\n\nAnother contender for the role is Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, who - if elected - would be the first female Nato chief.\n\nIn his interview with The Economist, Mr Wallace said whoever takes on the role would need to deal with \"a lot of unresolved issues in Nato,\" including differing demands from US and French leadership.\n\nFrance believes Nato's secretary general should come from within the European Union.\n\nWith less than a month to go until the Nato summit in Lithuania, it looks increasingly likely that Mr Stoltenberg will be asked to extend his tenure again.\n\nNato was formed in 1949 by 12 countries and its original goal was to challenge Soviet expansion in Europe after World War Two.\n\nMore recently, Russia has used the expansion of Nato as a pretext for its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Kyiv is not a member, but has received support from alliance members.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he was disappointed his country had not been invited to join Nato at next month's summit in Vilnius, adding that Ukraine would be the strongest member of Nato's eastern flank.\n\nSign up for our UK morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.", "Police are searching for an animal they believe is a lioness in the south-western outskirts of Berlin.\n\nA police spokeswoman said they received calls and a video alerting them to the wild animal at about midnight on Wednesday, and immediately began their search.\n\nAt least 30 police cars were deployed, and veterinarians were called to assist in the search for the big cat.\n\nResidents were told to stay indoors until it is found.\n\nOn Thursday evening, police told a local resident that they had \"just seen\" the lioness and that the search for the animal had entered a \"hot phase\", German outlet Bild reported, adding that officers shouted at joggers to \"get out of the woods quickly\".\n\nHowever, the animal remained elusive after nightfall on Thursday as police hunted with night vision and thermal imaging equipment.\n\nWhile the number of officers has been reduced, Beate Ostertag of Berlin police told public broadcaster RBB that police would \"be in action until the animal is found\".\n\nKleinmachnow Mayor Michael Grubert earlier said authorities had not been able to verify the initial reports of the animal sighting.\n\nA video shared on Twitter - which police believe is real - also appeared to show a lioness in a heavily forested residential area of Kleinmachnow.\n\nHowever, it is unclear where the animal came from. Local zoos, animal sanctuaries and circuses said no lions have escaped from their facilities.\n\nPolice spokesperson Daniel Keip told RBB that \"in the summer you often hear reports of crocodiles in swimming lakes and then it turns out all it was, was a big duck. In this case it's obviously totally real. We're dealing with a lioness that's roaming freely through Teltow, Stahnsdorf and Kleinmachnow.\"\n\nBut Michel Rogall, a circus director in Teltow who was woken by police at 02:00 local time, is not so sure.\n\n\"If it's a lion, I'll eat my hat,\" he told the Tagesspiegel newspaper. In addition, he told Reuters that there was no circus with wild animals on the road in eastern Germany, \"and they wouldn't escape either [if there was]\".\n\nResidents have been advised to stay indoors and keep their pets with them. Police have also told people to avoid the forest and seek shelter immediately if they see the lioness.\n\nMr Grubert said authorities were focusing their search on a large area next to a wood where people walk their dogs. Authorities believe the lioness may be sleeping there.\n\nHe added that there was \"no panic, no hysteria... but we do urge people not to go running or cycling in the woods\".\n\n\"Our hunters... are also equipped with ammunition,\" he said. \"The first objective is to capture. Other measures will only be taken by police officers if their lives or the lives of others are endangered.\"\n\nHelicopters have been deployed to find the elusive animal as well as drones and heat-seeking cameras, Mr Grubert said.\n\nVeterinarians and hunters with tranquiliser guns are also involved in the search, while local media reported that police were using an armoured vehicle normally deployed in anti-terrorism operations.\n\nFlorian Eiserlo of the Four Paws animal welfare organisation told the Rheinische Post newspaper that if anyone runs into the animal, they should not panic.\n\n\"Stand still, stay calm, try to head to a safe area such as a car or a building,\" they said.\n\nBerlin's local press is also full of tips on what to do if one does run into a lioness - which includes not running or panicking, and slowly backing away from it.\n\nVanessa Amoroso, head of the wild animals in trade unit at Four Paws, said if the animal was a lioness, it is likely to have been kept as a pet.\n\nShe said inconsistent laws across Europe made the trade of big cats much easier, as they are allowed as pets in many countries.\n\nMs Amoroso called on the German government to regulate those trading and keeping exotic animals.\n\n\"Germany's position as one of the world's largest markets for wild animals as pets demands effective measures to counteract the ease with which potential buyers can acquire animals through online platforms and exchanges,\" she added.", "Four Americans kidnapped by heavily armed men in Matamoros, Mexico, had travelled there for cosmetic surgery, relatives told US media.\n\nOne of them was to have a tummy tuck - removing abdominal fat - in a border town, said the sister of one of them.\n\n\"To see a member of your family thrown in the back of a truck and dragged, it is just unbelievable,\" Zalandria Brown, told AP about her brother Zindell.\n\nA Mexican woman was killed in the incident.\n\nThe FBI has offered a $50,000 (\u00a342,000) reward for the return of the Americans.\n\nThe other people in the group have been identified in US media as Latavia McGee - a mother of six, according to CNN - Shaeed Woodard and Eric James Williams.\n\nThey were driving through Matamoros - a city of 500,000 located directly across the border from the Texas town of Brownsville - in a white minivan with North Carolina licence plates when unidentified gunmen opened fire, the FBI said.\n\nVideo shows them being put in a pickup truck by heavily armed men.

He said his \"entire government\" was working to secure the Americans' release.\n\nAccording to an unnamed US official quoted by CNN, investigators believe a Mexican cartel probably mistook the Americans for Haitian drug smugglers.\n\nBarbara Burgess, Ms McGee's mother, told ABC news that she had warned her daughter not to go but her daughter told her: \"Ma, I'll be OK.\"\n\nOn Friday her daughter called her to say she was about to go to the appointment for the tummy tuck operation, also known as an abdominoplasty.\n\nWhen Barbara Burgess called her back later that day, the phone went to voicemail.\n\nMs Brown said her brother, who lives in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, had been aware that parts of Mexico could be dangerous.\n\n\"Zindell kept saying, 'We shouldn't go down',\" she told AP, adding that it was \"like a bad dream you wish you could wake up from\".\n\nMatamoros is in Tamaulipas state, one of six Mexican states that the US State Department advises travellers not to visit because of \"crime and kidnapping\".\n\nDrug cartels control much of the territory and often hold more power than local law enforcement.\n\nThe US government says hundreds of thousands of Americans cross the border into Mexico each year to receive healthcare services in search of cheaper treatments.\n\nMexico is one of the top medical tourism destinations around the world, while cosmetic surgery is one of the top procedures patients seek abroad, according to Patients Beyond Borders, a medical tourism guidebook.", "The Scottish SPCA said the animals are not used to human interaction and can become highly distressed\n\nAn animal charity has warned the public not to take home wild fawns as it is a \"death sentence\" for the creatures.\n\nIt comes after a number of the animals were taken home by members of the public, who believed they had been abandoned.\n\nThe Scottish SPCA said one of the people refused to reveal their location and said they knew how to care for the animal after reading online advice.\n\nFawns are often left hidden by their mothers while they forage for food.\n\nThe charity said the anonymous caller kept the fawn outside with their family dog, which would have added to its distress.\n\nLast month a fawn arrived at the charity's rescue centre in Alloa with aspiration pneumonia after a member of the public took it home for a few days after its mother was killed on a road.\n\nThe condition is caused when milk enters the fawn's lungs after being fed unsuitable food and milk.\n\nThe animal died, despite the best efforts of staff to save it.\n\nApril Dodds from the Scottish SPCA said it was \"incredibly upsetting\" for staff to watch the animals die needlessly.\n\nShe said: \"Fawns are possibly the most complex and challenging animal we deal with at the National Wildlife Rescue Centre.\n\n\"In many cases removing that young animal from the wild is effectively a death sentence.\n\n\"These are wild animals, not domesticated pets who are used to human interaction, so trying to pet or comfort them only causes more stress.\"\n\nThe charity said fawns which are walking about and calling out may need help.\n\nIt said the fawn should be monitored from a distance for a few hours to allow the mother to return.\n\nIf no mother returns to feed the fawn, then the public should call the charity's animal helpline on 03000 999 999.\n\u2022 None Why are large numbers of red deer being killed?", "UK schools have been left confused by the fast rate of change in artificial intelligence (AI) and its impact on education, head teachers are warning.\n\nIn a letter to the Times, educators from the state and private sector say developments are \"bewildering\".\n\nThey are launching a body of experts to advise schools on which areas are \"beneficial, and which are damaging\".\n\nThe technology is moving \"far too quickly\" for government alone to give adequate advice to schools, they say.\n\nAI is the \"greatest threat but also potentially the greatest benefit to our students, staff and schools\", the teachers, led by Sir Anthony Seldon, the headteacher of Epsom College, say in the letter.\n\nThe group has also questioned the role of digital companies behind AI.\n\n\"We have no confidence that the large digital companies will be capable of regulating themselves in the interests of students, staff and schools\" their letter reads.\n\nConcerns have quickly grown in recent months over AI with the prominence of the ChatGPT bot which has passed exams.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak recently said that regulation had to evolve at the same time rapid changes are made in AI. He said \"guardrails\" should be put in place to maximise the benefits of AI while minimising the risks to society.\n\nThe group of educators said it was pleased the government was \"grasping the nettle\" on the issue but felt the need to set up its own body composed of leading teachers \"guided by a panel of independent digital and AI experts\".\n\nA spokeswoman for the Department of Education told the Times the education secretary \"has been clear about the government's appetite to pursue the opportunities - and manage the risks - that exists in this space, and we have already published information to help schools do this.\n\n\"We continue to work with experts, including in education, to share and identify best practice.\"", "Hanks says he has \"pulled every single one\" of the moments of bad behaviour he describes in his novel\n\nTom Hanks says he has written his first novel as a \"release from the never-ending pressure\" of making movies.\n\nThe two-time Oscar winner is publishing The Making of Another Major Motion Picture Masterpiece, inspired by his own screen career.\n\nThe long grind of shooting a film, he tells the BBC, means you can \"just run out of curiosity for the job\".\n\n\"Sometimes you just have to have some other reason to spark your imagination,\" he explains.\n\nHanks, 66, says he has \"always\" written \"in some form or another\". His collection of short stories, Uncommon Type, was published in 2017 and has sold more than 234,000 copies in the UK.\n\nHe began writing the 448-page novel the following year. \"I wrote in between films, I wrote wherever I was, I wrote on planes, I wrote at home, I wrote on vacation, I wrote in hotel rooms, I wrote on long weekends when I wasn't working,\" he says.\n\n\"It's not fair,\" he concedes, that his debut novel has been published without going through the usual trial of rejections from publishers, while other first-time writers struggle.\n\nBut he is unapologetic and knows the book will ultimately \"live and die based on its own ability to entertain and enlighten an audience\".\n\nCritics' verdicts of The Making of Another Major Motion Picture Masterpiece have been lukewarm.\n\nIn The Sunday Times, David Sexton described the book as \"Hanks mansplains movie-making\", and said the \"writing is clunky throughout\".\n\nThe Observer's Tim Adams said it \"captures the humdrum of Hollywood but lacks his on-screen ability to breathe life into characters\".\n\nHanks played Elvis Presley's manager Col Tom Parker in a biopic of the singer\n\nHanks is unfazed by reviews. He says his \"day job as a movie star\" means he can \"handle\" any criticism.\n\nThe actor says he has become \"stronger when it comes down to really being torn apart\".\n\nHis novel is about the making of a multi-million dollar superhero action movie, and features a cast of characters including an eccentric director and a self-important and highly obstructive male actor who disrupts and delays filming.\n\nSo it's a surprising admission when the affable voice of Woody in Toy Story confesses: \"I have pulled every single one of those moments of behaviour myself on a set.\n\n\"Not everybody is at their best every single day on a motion picture set,\" he continues.\n\n\"I've had tough days trying to be a professional when my life has been falling apart in more ways than one and the requirement for me that day is to be funny, charming and loving - and it's the last way I feel.\"\n\nHanks prides himself on always being on time, though. \"What cannot occur on a motion picture is that someone cannot monkey around with the timing or the length of the shoot or the budget. That is a cardinal sin in the motion picture business.\n\n\"You will be amazed,\" he adds, \"at how many people know that they can get away with it, and are told they can get away with it, because they are carrying the movie on their shoulders.\"\n\nIndeed, in the book he refers to actors who are \"cry-babies, psychological train wrecks, on-the-wagon alcoholics, off-the-wagon addicts... and more than a couple of feuds between the Talent.\"\n\nThere's mention of sexual harassment too.\n\nWho could he have been inspired by? Needless to say, Hanks just laughs when asked to name names.\n\nWith such bad behaviour in his novel, the actor-writer also believes it is unnecessary to airbrush classic books for modern audiences.\n\nNovels by Ian Fleming and Agatha Christie have been updated, and Hanks's own publisher Penguin Random House has altered the work of Roald Dahl and PG Wodehouse as part of an effort to remove potentially offensive language.\n\n\"I'm of the opinion that we're all grown-ups here. Let's have faith in our own sensibilities as opposed to having somebody decide what we may or may not be offended by,\" insists Hanks.\n\n\"Let me decide what I am offended by and what I'm not offended by. I would be against reading any book from any era that says 'abridged due to modern sensitivities'.\"\n\nFleming's secret agent James Bond gets a mention, and Hanks is unequivocal that Idris Elba should be the next 007.\n\n\"Understand this,\" he says. \"James Bond has a licence to kill. I would issue that licence to Idris Elba just based on the work that I've seen him do.\"\n\nTom Hanks cheered on Aston Villa when they played Arsenal in February\n\nAston Villa, the English Premier League football team Hanks supports, also appear in the novel. But he has no plans to buy the club, after the Hollywood actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney purchased Wrexham in 2020.\n\n\"I think Wrexham is a little bit different in the economic scale than Aston Villa,\" he laughs. \"That's a little above my pay grade.\"\n\nHe hasn't seen fellow Villa supporter the Prince of Wales at a game, although he has experienced \"the Prince William treatment, which is - don't get stuck in traffic, no matter what the score is.\n\n\"When it was time to leave, there was no nonsense getting out.\"\n\nSo what next? Another novel would be \"nice\", but not for a few years due to a busy filming schedule.\n\nBut the desire to write is always there, he says.\n\n\"It's just the best way to spend ones time outside of being with those that you love and make you laugh.\"", "A \"remarkable\" Roman villa has been unearthed on a housing development.\n\nArchaeologists from the Red River Archaeology Group came across the complex while working on a Barratt and David Wilson Homes housing development at Brookside Meadows in Grove near Wantage, Oxfordshire.\n\nThe site sits on a landscape inhabited since the Bronze Age which has been described as \"artefact-rich\".\n\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

We have to make sure that we're not obsessing about Section 30s and de facto referendums because people just don't get inspired by that.\"\n\nMr Yousaf is the only candidate to have said he would challenge the UK government's block on the gender recognition reforms in the courts and to have backed the proposals in the final vote last December.\n\nThe health secretary has warned the SNP against a \"lurch to the right\" on social issues, which he said could see it \"lose vast swathes of support\" and make it \"very possible we will not be electable\".\n\nBut he has faced accusations - which he strongly denies - that he \"ducked\" the vote that legalised gay marriage in 2014 because of religious pressure from a Glasgow mosque.\n\nAsh Regan quit as the Scottish government's community safety minister over the gender reforms, saying that her conscience would not allow her to support the self-identification plans.\n\nShe is a long-standing critic of the proposals and has said she would \"never vote for anything that would put women and girls in danger\".\n\nMs Regan has also made clear she would not challenge the UK government block in the courts as \"I don't believe we would win\".\n\nKate Forbes did not take part in the final vote on the gender reforms as she was on maternity leave, but was one of the SNP politicians who had previously signed an open letter to Nicola Sturgeon highlighting concerns over the legislation.\n\nShe has said she would not have supported the reforms if she had been in parliament, and it seems unlikely that she would launch a legal challenge to the UK government's veto.\n\nMs Forbes, who is a member of the Free Church of Scotland, has faced fierce criticism from senior SNP figures including Deputy First Minister John Swinney over her opposition to gay marriage and her socially conservative views on issues such as abortion and having children outside marriage.\n\nKate Forbes has said she would not raise income tax for higher earners and would instead focus on growing the economy and expanding the tax base by cutting red tape for businesses - including a pause on the deposit return scheme - and improving transport infrastructure.\n\nThe finance secretary was on maternity leave when the Scottish government raised income tax rates for higher earners, and has said she wants Scotland to be a high growth economy \"so that high tax is no longer required\".\n\nShe has argued that the only way of cutting poverty is \"make the Scottish economy more prosperous because that creates more, better jobs and raises more funding to reinvest in front line services\".\n\nHumza Yousaf has outlined a plan to fast-track the expansion of childcare to one and two-year-olds, which he believes would be a game changer for working families and the wider economy. The UK government has unveiled a similar plan for England.\n\nHe backed the recent income tax rises, and argues that the \"failed economic consensus of both Westminster parties has given Scotland the worst of both worlds - low growth and low productivity, combined with unacceptably high poverty and inequality\".\n\nHe has said he wants Scotland to \"chart a different course\" and to create a \"wellbeing economy\" that \"puts the equality, happiness and health of all Scotland's citizens at its heart\" and which would see trade unions and workers have a greater input into economic policy and has said that small businesses could be excluded from the deposit return scheme for the first year.\n\nAsh Regan wants a pause to the deposit return scheme, which aims to improve recycling rates for single-use drinks containers but has been at the centre of controversy over its impact on smaller firms such as craft breweries.\n\nShe has said the scheme was an example of the Scottish government failing to listen to what people were saying, and that some businesses \"just don't know how they are going to make this work\".\n\nMs Regan has also said that many of the issues facing the Scottish economy, including child poverty rates, cannot be fixed under devolution and that the country needs the full economic levers of independence.\n\nHumza Yousaf - who is currently the country's health secretary - has said he would be open to changing controversial plans to create a national care service if he becomes first minister by working with critics of the scheme in an attempt to find compromise.\n\nHis supporters say that Mr Yousaf has the experience of guiding the NHS through the aftermath of the Covid pandemic, and has managed to avoid the strikes by health workers that have hit other parts of the UK.\n\nHe apologised for soaring NHS waiting times during the recent BBC Scotland TV debate, telling an audience member whose husband was facing a wait of between three and six years for knee surgery that \"not just myself as health secretary, but the entire government is focused on reducing those waiting lists\".\n\nAsh Regan has said that improving the health service would be her main objective if she becomes the country's next first minister.\n\nShe wants to hold a summit of frontline health workers to identify and then tackle the issues facing NHS staff.\n\nMs Regan said: \"There has been too much focus on targets and goals - the nurses and midwives I've met during this leadership election are telling me they are exhausted, the NHS has been running on goodwill for too long, it is time for change\".\n\nKate Forbes has said she wants to rethink the national care service plans because the scheme must have the confidence of everyone who delivers and uses it if it is to be successful.\n\nShe has also proposed setting up an inquiry to look at giving the NHS a radical overhaul, but has stressed that it must remain free at the point of need.\n\nMs Forbes said: \"We shouldn't be shy of discussing the need for reform in order to ensure that our NHS is prepared, and not just for the next year, but it's still providing treatment free at the point of need in the next few decades.\"\n\nKate Forbes has said she wants to simplify the education system and \"empower\" teachers and other frontline staff by reducing the burden on them, giving them greater freedom over staffing and resources and allowing them to get on with the job of teaching children.\n\nShe said: \"What I want to see is an education system that teachers our children and that ensures that when they leave school they are ready for further education or they are ready for the workplace\".\n\nMs Forbes has also highlighted the importance of cutting poverty levels, saying that some children in Scotland are arriving at school \"too hungry to learn\".\n\nAsh Regan believes many teachers are having to spend too much time dealing with bureaucracy and \"filling in forms\" rather than teaching, and wants to free them up from that.\n\nShe has also said that some schools are expecting teachers to also effectively be psychologists and social workers.\n\nMs Regan has said that some schools could therefore have an in-house social worker \"which could take that away from the teachers and free them up just to teach, which is obviously what they do best\".\n\nHumza Yousaf has said he wants to reduce inequality and for \"every single child in Scotland to have the same opportunities both my girls have\".\n\nHe has admitted that the Scottish government has \"much further to go\" in closing the attainment gap between the wealthiest and most deprived pupils.\n\nMr Yousaf wants to expand the provision of free school meals, breakfast clubs and after-school clubs, with a particular focus on those areas with the highest deprivation, and to improve the early diagnosis of autism and learning difficulties.", "Police release bodycam footage from a school shooting in Nashville that left six people dead, including three children.

There was also an overall squeeze on health spending.\n\nGeorge Osborne was quizzed on the impact of spending cuts\n\nMr Osborne - who was chancellor from 2010 to 2016 - said: \"If we had not done that Britain would have been more exposed, not just to future things like the coronavirus pandemic, but indeed to the fiscal crisis which very rapidly followed in countries across Europe.\n\n\"If we had not had a clear plan to put the public finances on a sustainable path then Britain might have experienced a fiscal crisis, we would not have had the fiscal space to deal with the coronavirus pandemic when it hit.\"\n\nThe British Medical Association said Mr Osborne's \"denial\" of a connection between austerity and the impact of the pandemic on the most vulnerable was \"staggering\".\n\nOn Monday, the Trades Union Congress (TUC) produced a report which said austerity had led to unsafe staffing in public services leaving the UK \"hugely unprepared\" for Covid.\n\nDuring the one hour 20 minute question session, Mr Osborne was also asked about the Treasury's planning for potential national lockdown.\n\nHe said the department had plans for an outbreak of influenza but added \"given what subsequently happened that was very small scale\".\n\n\"There was no planning done by Treasury - or any western Treasury - for asking the entire population to stay at home for months and months on end.\n\n\"If someone had said to you the UK government should be preparing for a lockdown that might last for months, then I have no doubt the Treasury would have developed schemes it did subsequently develop around the furlough and the Covid loans.\n\n\"Planning could have been done for a furlough scheme in advance - I'm not clear that would have made a better furlough scheme than the one we as a country actually saw.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, Sir Oliver Letwin, a senior minister in David Cameron's government, told the inquiry a rapid turnover of civil service staff hindered the government's ability to plan for pandemics.\n\nHe also warned that the UK was \"wildly under-resilient\" and said there should be a minister \"solely devoted\" to the subject.\n\nLabour said the admissions were \"too little, too late\", adding the Conservatives \"cannot be trusted to protect the public from the emergencies of tomorrow\".\n\nSign up for our UK morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.", "Homme said he was \"extremely thankful that I'll get through this\"\n\nSinger and guitarist Josh Homme, founder of rock band Queens of the Stone Age, has revealed he was diagnosed with cancer last year.\n\nHe had a successful operation to remove it and is \"still healing\", according to Revolver magazine.\n\nHomme told Revolver: \"Cancer is just the cherry on top of an interesting time period, you know?

There are now holiday villages at Elveden Forest, Longleat Forest, Whinfell Forest and Woburn Forest.\n\nIn 2019, it opened its first site in Ireland, with Center Parcs Longford Forest close to the town of Ballymahon in County Longford.\n\nThe Financial Times said that Brookfield had appointed investment bankers to sound out potential buyers, including other private equity firms.\n\nDanni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell, said there still appeared to be strong demand for Center Parcs holidays for now, with some wealthier holidaymakers trading down from holidays abroad.\n\n\"During the pandemic Brits rushed to snap up sought after places, but even with cash-strapped families ditching the extra 'staycation' in favour of one holiday, it's clear by the prices and availability that there's still more than enough business to go around - so far,\" she said.\n\nBut rising mortgage costs and the difficult economic climate did raise a question over future growth, she added.\n\nEarlier this year, Center Parcs scrapped plans to develop a new holiday village in West Sussex.\n\nIn July 2021, the company had secured an option agreement to acquire Oldhouse Warren, a privately-owned woodland on the outskirts of Crawley.\n\nHowever, Center Parcs said a \"rigorous\" environmental survey had revealed that the site was not suitable for development.\n\nEnvironmentalists had argued that the site would destroy established woodland and damage the habitats of rare birds.\n\nAt the end of last year Center Parcs said occupancy rates were at 97.3%, and broadly in line with pre-Covid levels.\n\nRevenue of \u00a3426.6m between April and December last year represented a 20% increase compared to the same period a year earlier, and 18% higher than before the pandemic.\n\nLast year, Center Parcs was forced to backtrack over a decision to ask guests to leave its sites on the day of the Queen's funeral.\n\nWhen it announced the move, it said the decision was made \"as a mark of respect\" and to allow employees to \"be part of this historic moment\".\n\nBut the move prompted angry complaints from holidaymakers as it would have meant some guests would have had to leave part-way through their break and return afterwards.\n\nCenter Parcs UK is a separate business from Center Parcs Europe, which has holiday villages in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and France. The European business is still owned by Blackstone Group which sold the UK part of the business to Brookfield in 2015.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

But Mr Gittins said a mismatch between supply and demand was the real problem.\n\n\"The main issue is not affordability for the majority of the market - it's the stock issue,\" he told Radio 4's Today Programme.\n\nMr Gittins put the \"unhealthy\" supply and demand challenges down to recent policy decisions.\n\nIn its update to investors, Foxtons said the housing market relied on the availability of mortgage financing. It noted that interest rates had increased globally last year, with the UK impacted \"in particular\" by the government's \"mini-budget\" last September.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, there was a drop in buy-to-let mortgage deals with many property investors reliant on interest-only mortgages hit by the volatility. Foxtons said this was likely to \"adversely affect affordability\" in the housing market.\n\nHe predicted the shortage in the market would continue for the next two to three years.\n\nBut Foxtons expects sales activity, which has slowed in the last six months, to improve in the latter part of this year.\n\n\"Mortgage rates have started to reduce in recent weeks and buyer activity is picking up, which may result in a more favourable sales market in the latter part of the year,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nRental site SpareRoom said the number of renters versus rooms available in London and its surroundings was higher this month compared to the same time last year.\n\nAccording to its data, there were five active renters for each room available, versus two last March. The number was as high as eight per room in September 2022.\n\n\"The last 12 months has seen rents across the UK hit record highs and, unless new supply comes into market over the coming months, it's hard to see how those rents will come down,\" SpareRoom director Matt Hutchinson told the BBC.\n\n\"High rents not only make it difficult for tenants who need to move now, it also means that many stay put to avoid paying more rent,\" he added.\n\nAverage UK house prices fell in the second half of 2022 as buyers were squeezed by higher mortgage rates and living costs.\n\nHowever, fresh figures from the Halifax suggest the situation has improved somewhat. Average UK property values increased by 1.1% on a monthly basis in February, it said, accelerating from 0.2% growth in January.\n\nKim Kinnaird, director at Halifax Mortgages, said: \"Recent reductions in mortgage rates, improving consumer confidence, and a continuing resilience in the labour market are arguably helping to stabilise prices following the falls seen in November and December.\n\n\"Still, with the cost of a home down on a quarterly basis (by 2.5%), the underlying activity continues to indicate a general downward trend.\n\nEarlier this month, property portal Rightmove found that house hunters are looking in a wider geographical area compared to before the pandemic, with increased searches for more properties in cheaper areas further afield.\n\nGuy Gittins took up his role last September, faced with the worst housing market since the financial crisis.\n\nIn an early move, he bought a fleet of green and yellow Mini Coopers for the estate agent's sales force.\n\nHe also spent on sending around 100 of the firm's top-performing employees to the Italian ski resort of Courmayeur.\n\nMr Gittins started his career at Foxtons in 2002 on a salary of \u00a322,000.

Watch: We can make a big difference to childcare costs, says Jeremy Hunt\n\nThe chancellor has vowed to help reduce the cost of childcare at Wednesday's Budget as part of a wider drive to help people into work.\n\nJeremy Hunt told the BBC that costs were stopping some parents taking a job, and the government could make a \"big difference\" to reduce them.\n\nHe said further support would be part of a package of measures to break down \"barriers\" to entering the workforce.\n\nBut he said public finances meant the room for tax cuts was limited.\n\nMinisters have a lot of heavy lifting to do to make a big impression at the Budget, against the backdrop of an economy that is still wobbly.\n\nConservative backbench MPs are calling for tax cuts they are not going to get, whilst Labour is slamming the government's long-term record.\n\nShadow chancellor Rachel Reeves says her party's plan to secure more investment in green industries could arrest a \"low growth spiral\" in the UK.\n\nUnder Budget plans that have already been announced, the government is expected to pay childcare support to parents on universal credit up front instead in arrears, as now.\n\nThe current UK-wide \u00a3646-a-month per child cap on support for universal credit claimants is also expected to be increased by several hundred pounds. An exact figure has not yet been given.\n\nIt is expected to be part of a package of measures designed to reverse a rise in economic inactivity since Covid, including changes to fitness-to-work tests for those with medical conditions.\n\nThe Budget is also expected to extend the current level of support for energy bills, limiting costs for a typical family to \u00a32,500 a year, for a further three months until June.\n\nOther measures reportedly under consideration, but not yet confirmed, include continuing the 5p cut to fuel duty, changes to tax-free pensions allowances, and bringing forward a rise in the pension age.\n\nMr Hunt has also resisted Tory calls for the planned rise in corporation tax from 19% to 25% to be cancelled or deferred.\n\nDownplaying the prospects of a major tax-cutting Budget, Mr Hunt said it was important to be \"responsible with [the] public finances\".\n\nAdding that any cuts would have to be \"within the bounds of what is responsible,\" he said \"Conservatives cut taxes when they can\".\n\nHe also signalled that he was unlikely to announce further childcare support for families that don't qualify for Universal Credit, describing this as \"expensive\".\n\nAlthough ministers \"would like to help everyone,\" he added that \"you can't always do everything at once\".\n\nCutting childcare costs has emerged as a key political battleground, with prices in the UK among the highest in the world.\n\nCritics say the current level of government support means it is simply not worth large numbers of parents, even those on middle incomes, taking on new or extra work.\n\nEarly Years Alliance, an education charity, has welcomed the changes for families on benefits, but urged a \"wider package of measures\" to bring down costs for parents.\n\nLabour has promised to completely overhaul the system in England if it takes office, saying the current model of free childcare hours is \"broken\".\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

There was an atmosphere of tolerance, but actually respect as well.\"\n\nJosh Simons, director of the Labour Together think tank that is supportive of Sir Keir's leadership, denied there was a purge of the Labour left.\n\nHe told Newsnight that Sir Keir was building a party \"capable and equipped to govern this country and transform it,\" including getting people \"with talent, with energy, with vigour and commitment into Parliament to do that\".\n\nHe also added that the Labour leader was implementing recommendations from the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, which published a review in 2020 into how the party handled complaints of antisemitism within the party.\n\n\"And if there are people who have tweeted things, shared things on Facebook, engaged with posts that fall foul of those EHRC recommendations, then those people are and should be blocked from being part of the Labour party's leadership in the future,\" he added.\n\nYou can watch BBC Newsnight's interview in full on Tuesday 4 July from 22.30 BST on BBC Two.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nFormer X Factor contestant Lucy Spraggan has told BBC News that taking part in the show in 2012 felt like being in \"an abusive relationship\".\n\nShe has revealed the reason she left the ITV show abruptly after week three was because she had been raped, and was not ill, as reported at the time.\n\nThe singer-songwriter says the industry needs to change to better protect people taking part in reality TV shows.\n\nBoth ITV and Fremantle say they are evolving their duty of care processes.\n\nX Factor was made for ITV by Talkback Thames - part of production company Fremantle - and Simon Cowell's company Syco.\n\nSimon Cowell has described what happened to Spraggan as \"horrific and heartbreaking\".\n\nSpraggan has waived her legal right to anonymity, granted to victims of sexual offences, to speak to the BBC in her first broadcast interview.\n\nIn 2012, X Factor was one of the UK's most-watched TV shows and Spraggan became an overnight sensation when millions watched her audition.\n\n\"From that moment on, my life changed forever,\" she tells the BBC.\n\n\"From the beginning, they kind of make you into a caricature of yourself. It's almost like there's a storyline written for you,\" she adds.\n\nLucy sang a song she had written herself at her 2012 audition\n\nSpraggan, who was 20 at the time, says the contestants were immediately put under huge pressure.\n\n\"From the very first stage that message was reiterated and reiterated and reiterated to the point where that's all you believe - [that] 'this is the biggest opportunity of my life,'\" she says.\n\nNow 31, she says she has never since experienced a situation where \"somebody completely takes the reins of my life\".\n\n\"If I had experienced that again, as a normal human being, I would have said that I would have been in an abusive relationship.\"\n\nSpraggan details her experiences on the show in her new memoir, Process: Finding My Way Through, including the sexual assault.\n\nIt happened at a hotel where she and her fellow contestant - the broadcaster Rylan Clark - had been moved to, away from the others.\n\nThey had initially been staying at the luxury Corinthia Hotel in central London, where Spraggan says they were guarded by 24-hour security.\n\nShe says the show's producers told her the hotel had asked the pair to leave because they were \"causing too much trouble\". Headlines had branded them \"party animals\".\n\n\"So Rylan and I always sort of were under the impression that we were removed, because that supported the narrative,\" Spraggan says.\n\nThe pair were not given additional security at the new hotel, she adds.\n\nIf you are affected by any of the issues in this story, please visit BBC Action Line.\n\nThe night they were moved, Spraggan attended Rylan's birthday party at a club in Mayfair.\n\nSpraggan says she can't remember what happened that night and has pieced together the incident through information from the police and others.\n\nShe knows she was not conscious - because she had been drinking alcohol at the party - when she was escorted back to the hotel by a member of the production team.\n\n\"The hotel porter that had offered his help to get me up to bed\u2026 got a key card, let himself into my room and raped me,\" she explains.\n\nIn 2013, the porter pleaded guilty to the attack and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nRylan was the first person Spraggan told about what happened. \"He was unbelievable,\" she says, describing him as \"an angel\".\n\nSpraggan says being examined by police for evidence was \"one of the worst experiences\" of her life. But she also knew that the show - which turned unknowns into singing stars - was the biggest opportunity of her life, and the fourth live show was due to be filmed the following day.\n\n\"It was like, this extraordinary thing's happened. The police are here, I've just had this examination. And people still asking me, 'What do you want to do? What do you want to do?' And I was like, 'I want to carry on with the show.'\n\n\"It kind of shows you what kind of world you are in, in what kind of mindset you are in, to not be able to really measure what has happened, and what you should do now.\"\n\nLucy says the day after the attack she was put in another hotel room, with a security guard outside.\n\n\"I remember sort of having to peel myself away from jumping off the balcony. Like having to consciously do that.\"\n\nSpraggan's next album, called Balance, will be released in August\n\nShe decided to leave the show after week three of the competition. But she wasn't voted out by the public or the show's judges - she realised that mentally she couldn't continue.\n\nTo explain why she had left, ITV announced that she was ill. Spraggan says she feels she had to go along with the narrative at the time, but says she is now relieved she can tell the truth.\n\nSpraggan felt like she didn't get enough support in the aftermath of the attack - and in the following years her mental health deteriorated considerably and she abused alcohol and drugs. She has now been sober for nearly four years.\n\nFremantle said: \"Whilst we believed throughout that we were doing our best to support Lucy, as Lucy thinks we could have done more, we must therefore recognise this. For everything Lucy has suffered, we are extremely sorry.\"\n\nThe star is now calling for all production and broadcast companies to better consider employees' and participants' mental health - by setting aside a portion of their budgets to invest in mental wellbeing services.\n\n\"I don't want to destroy anything. I want to build a better infrastructure,\" she says.\n\n\"We need these shows, because there's a thriving community of talented people who just don't have the funds and the opportunity to get there.\"\n\nX Factor's creator, Simon Cowell was not a judge in 2012 because he was in America launching X Factor US. Spraggan says she was ready to give him \"a piece of my mind\" when he called her, after she had contacted his people to say she was writing her book.\n\nShe says he said, \"Lucy, before you or I say anything else, the first thing I need to tell you is that I am sorry.\"\n\nSpraggan reflects: \"It makes me emotional because no-one else said sorry. And all it took was this one man to treat me like a human being, 11 years later.\"\n\nIn 2021, Ofcom, the broadcast regulator, announced changes to its Broadcasting Code to better protect people made vulnerable by their participation in TV shows. The changes were introduced after suicides involving contestants from Love Island and The Jeremy Kyle Show in 2018 and 2019.\n\nEarlier this year, the BBC and ITV announced they were joining forces to recruit more registered psychologists to support TV programmes in their duty of care to contributors.\n\n\"My voice is extremely inconvenient for a lot of people. I've been petrified of telling the truth, because I'll lose what I have,\" Spraggan says.\n\n\"If I have to be the first person who says 'I'm actually not scared to stand up against you [the industry]', I will. And hopefully it inspires other people to be a little bit braver too.\"\n\nIn a statement, ITV said it had \"the deepest compassion for Lucy\". It said the production companies, Fremantle and Syco, were primarily responsible for the duty of care towards all of its programme contributors.\n\nBut it added it \"is committed to having in place\u2026 robust oversight procedures, to [ensure] that independent producers employ the correct processes to protect the mental health and welfare of participants\".", "The law aims to give protection for individuals around their sexuality and gender identity, among other protected characteristics\n\nWhat do a sex shop, a mushroom farm and a \"hate monster\" have in common?\n\nThey're all at the heart of a blazing row about prejudice, offence and freedom of speech in Scotland.\n\nA public information campaign highlighting the introduction on 1 April of the Hate Crime and Public Order (Scotland) Act has begun \u2014 and is itself controversial.\n\nIt includes a Police Scotland video featuring a character called the hate monster who gets \"bigger and bigger, \"till he's weighing ye doon.\"\n\n\"Then, before ye know it,\" the subtitled video goes on, \"ye've committed a hate crime.\"\n\nThe video has been ridiculed on social media as patronising.\n\nThe former Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont described it on X, formerly Twitter, as \"puerile,\" adding \"the notion that hate is driven by economic disadvantage insults all who support their families and communities despite poverty.\"\n\n\"It ignores the hatred exercised by those who are financially secure,\" she added.\n\nA cartoon \"hate monster\" in a public information campaign has itself become a source of controversy\n\nSupporters of the new legislation say the row about the video is a distraction from what they regard as a serious and essential attempt to make Scotland a more tolerant society.\n\nFirst Minister Humza Yousaf was the justice secretary who shepherded the Hate Crime bill through the Scottish Parliament, declaring at the time that it \"sent a strong and clear message to victims, perpetrators, communities and to wider society that offences motivated by prejudice will be treated seriously and will not be tolerated.\"\n\nThe law criminalises threatening or abusive behaviour which is intended to stir up hatred against someone who possesses, or appears to possess, certain characteristics.\n\nThey are age, disability, religion, sexual orientation, transgender identity and variations in sex characteristics sometimes known as being intersex.\n\nStirring up racial hatred by using threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour was already illegal under the Public Order Act 1986 and that remains the case under the new legislation.\n\nThe new law also provides for stiffer sentences for offenders convicted of crimes deemed to be \"aggravated by prejudice,\" \u2014 in other words if they demonstrate malice or ill-will towards their victim based on the protected characteristics listed above, with the addition of a category for race, colour, nationality or ethnicity.\n\nControversially, the protected characteristics in the act do not include sex itself, an omission criticised by some feminist groups.\n\n\"This new law leaves women unprotected from hate crime,\" the Scottish National Party MP Joanna Cherry KC told me.\n\nIt would, she predicted, \"be weaponised by trans rights activists to try to silence, and worse still, criminalise women who do not share their beliefs.\"\n\n\"There is no right not be offended,\" added Ms Cherry.\n\nSNP MP Joanna Cherry said there was no right not to be offended\n\nThe Scottish government points out that it is preparing separate legislation relating to misogyny (hatred of women) after a review led by the human rights lawyer, Baroness Helena Kennedy KC.\n\nBut even some supporters of the new hate crime law as it stands have concerns, particularly about enforcement.\n\nPolice Scotland has pledged to investigate every hate crime complaint it receives, even though last week the force said it would no longer investigate every \"low level\" crime in Scotland, including some cases of theft.\n\nDavid Kennedy, general secretary of the Scottish Police Federation, the union which represents rank-and-file officers, said it was \"a recipe for disaster.\"\n\nOfficers \"were only receiving a two-hour online training package,\" on the new legislation, he told Mornings on BBC Radio Scotland, adding \"the police don't have time\" to deal with a deluge of complaints.\n\n\"They can barely attend the calls that are in law at the moment never mind a new act coming in place,\" warned Mr Kennedy.\n\nThere are concerns around how the new law will be enforced by police\n\nPolice Scotland said in addition to the training package, it was offering an extensive programme of workshops \"to allow officers to gain more understanding and ask any questions they may have.\"\n\nThe Scottish government insists its budget for next year \"includes record police funding\".\n\nNonetheless, concerns about police resources are shared by Roddy Dunlop KC, the dean of the Faculty of Advocates, which regulates senior lawyers in Scotland.\n\nHe said there was a danger of police being deluged by potentially trivial complaints made by people \"who claim to have been insulted by something that's been said online.\"\n\nPolice Scotland said no officer was available to be interviewed by BBC News about its approach to the hate crime legislation but it issued a statement which said: \"Hate crime can be verbal or physical and can take place anywhere, including online.\n\n\"We want everyone targeted by hate crime, or those who witness it, to have confidence to come forward.\n\n\"They can be assured they will be treated with dignity and respect, and that the circumstances they report will be fully investigated.\"\n\nTo help people do so, the force is promoting \"third party reporting centres\" where \"victims or witnesses of hate crime\" who don't feel comfortable going to the police can make an allegation.\n\nSuch sites have been in place for a decade. Libraries, charities and victim support services make up the vast bulk of them.\n\nBut the inclusion of places such as a mushroom farm in East Lothian and Luke and Jack's sex shop in Glasgow have raised eyebrows.\n\nLuke and Jack's founders, who describe themselves as \"passionate purveyors of pleasure products,\" robustly defended their inclusion in the network, insisting they were well placed to help with reporting crime.\n\nThe founders of a sex shop in Glasgow's Merchant City, Drew Bigglestone and Ian Diamond, believe it is a good choice for a third party reporting centre\n\nCo-founder Ian Diamond said the nature of their business meant customers would often open up about intimate details of their lives.\n\n\"We're not actually taking any of the information ourselves,\" he explained, adding \"we're just kind of handholding and making sure that the police are getting all the information that is necessary.\"\n\nIronically, publicity about the shop's role had led to a \"disturbing\" online backlash, he said, forcing the introduction of extra security measures for staff.\n\nThe Scottish government said no minister was available for interview.\n\nIn a statement it defended the use of third party reporting centres but also promised to set up a \"short-life working group\" to \"re-evaluate the criteria of a third-party reporting centre, recording and maintenance of the scheme and how to improve support for centres and victims.\"\n\nMore generally, the looming introduction of the hate crime bill has reignited debate about the Scottish government's approach to issues of personal freedom.\n\nIn 2018, MSPs voted to repeal a controversial law introduced by the SNP which criminalised the \"stirring up of hatred\" against certain people or groups in relation to football matches, as well as outlawing certain \"threatening communications\".\n\nThe following year, SNP ministers abandoned attempts to appoint a named person to safeguard the welfare of every child in the country, after the UK Supreme Court criticised the plan as a breach of privacy.\n\nMSPs made significant amendments to the current hate crime legislation when they were scrutinising the bill in parliament after lawyers, journalists and comedians raised concerns that it impinged on free speech.\n\nRoddy Dunlop KC said the actual law was much improved from its original draft, in particular because freedom of expression was now \"baked-in\" to it.\n\nHowever, he said, some \"very understandable concerns\" remained, and the Scottish state appeared to be more willing than it had been in previous times to interfere in people's private lives.\n\nMr Dunlop also said there was a danger of \"completely malicious\" complaints being recorded and retained by police, and urged the Scottish government to clarify how such data would be handled.\n\nThe UK government is grappling with similar issues as it discusses violence, hatred and intolerance in its attempt to define extremism.\n\nBut come April Fool's Day, many eyes will be on Scotland to see if it has managed to strike the right balance between authoritarianism and liberalism - and between freedom and safety - as it attempts to slay the \"hate monster\".\n\nThis article was amended to clarify the wording of the new legislation\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "Ukraine's leader said people's lives were at stake in the counter-offensive\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky has acknowledged battlefield progress has been \"slower than desired\", weeks into Ukraine's military offensive to recapture areas occupied by Russia.\n\n\"Some people believe this is a Hollywood movie and expect results now. It's not,\" he told the BBC.\n\nUkraine says its counter-offensive has reclaimed eight villages so far in the southern region of Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk to the east.\n\nMr Zelensky said the military push was not going easily because 200,000 sq km (77,220 sq miles) of Ukrainian territory had been mined by Russian forces.\n\n\"Whatever some might want, including attempts to pressure us, with all due respect, we will advance on the battlefield the way we deem best,\" Mr Zelensky added.\n\nHe reinforced the need for Ukraine to be given security guarantees from Nato but said ultimately the goal was membership of the defensive alliance.\n\nNato's secretary general made clear this week that no plan was on the table to issue an invitation to Ukraine at next month's summit in Lithuania.\n\n\"[Jens] Stoltenberg knows my position,\" the Ukrainian leader said \"We've told them numerous times: 'Don't knock the ground from under our feet.'\"\n\nThe Ukrainian leader again made the case for Ukraine to receive US-made F-16s and said he believed fighter pilots could start training as soon as August, and that the first jets could arrive in six or seven months' time.\n\nMr Zelensky was speaking to the BBC to mark a Ukraine Recovery Conference in London focusing on the role the private sector can play in rebuilding his country. He later spoke at the conference, along with UK PM Rishi Sunak.\n\nUkraine's economy shrank by 29.2% in 2022 and earlier this year the World Bank estimated the cost of reconstruction and recovery at $411bn (\u00a3339bn).\n\nThe Ukrainian leader told the BBC that the support he needed was not just for recovery but for transformation as well.\n\nHe said \"quick steps\" to be done immediately included finding places for people to live, rebuilding the destroyed Kakhovka dam and decentralising the energy network.\n\n\"But on the larger scale we are speaking about the transformation of Ukraine,\" he explained. \"This is Ukraine not only with its energy and agriculture and industrial complexes, but with its reforms we can see.\"\n\nHe spoke of \"the digitilisation of Ukraine\" as well as judicial and anti-corruption reforms.\n\nWhen I asked him what the endgame of the war looked like at this stage, he made clear that \"victories on the battlefield are necessary\" and that Ukraine would never sit down with whoever was president in Moscow, if Russia remained on Ukraine's territory.\n\n\"No matter how far we advance in our counter-offensive, we will not agree to a frozen conflict because that is war, that is a prospectless development for Ukraine.\"\n\nRussia announced a few days ago that it had moved tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus and President Joe Biden has warned that the threat of Vladimir Putin using them is real.\n\nSo I asked Mr Zelensky if he was worried by that threat.\n\n\"Putin has been dangerous for us since 2014 when he occupied the first of our territories,\" he said.\n\n\"He will talk about the use of nuclear weapons, I don't think he is ready to do it because he is scared for his life, he loves it a lot. But there is no way I could say for sure, especially about a person with no ties to reality, who in the 21st Century, launched a full-scale war against their neighbour.\"\n\nI also asked for his reaction to President Putin telling an international conference in St Petersburg last week that he was a disgrace to the Jewish people. Mr Zelensky lost many of his relatives in the Holocaust, including his grandfather, and it was clear that he was taken by surprise by the question.\n\nHe took a deep breath, put his head down and a few seconds later said he wasn't quite sure how to answer the question.\n\n\"It's like he doesn't fully understand his words. Apologies, but it's like he is the second king of antisemitism after Hitler.\n\n\"This is a president speaking. A civilised world cannot speak that way. But it was important for me to hear the reaction of the world and I am grateful for the support.\"", "The CBI is suspending key activities until June after a number of firms quit the business group following allegations of rape and sexual assault.\n\nDozens of firms have announced they are leaving the group or pausing their membership after new allegations about misconduct at the organisation.\n\nA second woman claimed she was raped by CBI colleagues in a Guardian article on Friday.\n\nThe CBI said it \"shares the shock and revulsion\" at the alleged events.\n\nThe board of the lobbying group said it wanted to talk to \"colleagues, members, experts and stakeholders\" to get their opinion on the CBI's future role and purpose.\n\n\"As a result, we have taken the difficult but necessary decision to suspend all policy and membership activity until an extraordinary general meeting in June,\" the board said in a statement.\n\nThe board will put forward proposals at that meeting \"for a refocused CBI\", it said, adding that \"this work and the cultural reform will be the entire and urgent focus of the organisation over the coming weeks.\"\n\nDespite membership operations being suspended until June, firms will still be free to quit if they choose, the BBC understands.\n\nThe City of London Police was investigating an alleged rape at a CBI summer party in 2019 before the Guardian reported the second incident.\n\nDetective Chief Superintendent Richard Waight from the City of London Police said no arrests had been made and investigations were continuing, and asked anyone with information to get in touch.\n\nThe brewer Adnams is among the dozens of firms that left the CBI on Friday following the recent allegations.\n\nChief executive Andy Wood told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme the CBI brand was \"beyond repair\", and it would have to \"reinvent itself root and branch\".\n\nHe pointed to the CBI's role in helping to design the furlough scheme, which paid part of workers' wages during the pandemic, as one of its great successes.\n\nBut Adnams is a member of two industry-specific trade associations that can also speak on its behalf.\n\n\"It may be that there's a need for those trade associations and business groups to come together on an ad hoc basis, if we were ever faced with something like the pandemic or something that affects the whole of industry, but I do think that people like the British Beer and Pub Association or UK Hospitality do a great job.

The world must conclude that it's impossible to have any kind of serious relationship with that country.\"\n\nSenior Ukrainian officials who spoke to the BBC here in Kyiv all argued that President Putin could not ride out a catastrophic loss of authority.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: The day Wagner chief went rogue... in 96 seconds\n\nIt started, they said, with his disastrous decision to mount a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February last year. The Wagner mutiny, and Mr Prigozhin's denunciation of the Kremlin's justifications for the war have, they said, removed what remained of Mr Putin's chances of hanging on.\n\n\"The Putin regime\" one of them insisted, \"cannot be saved.\"\n\nIt is vital to remember that anything Ukrainians, especially the ones running the country, say about their Russian enemies comes in the heat of a fight that they see, correctly, as a struggle for national survival.\n\nThe Ukrainians have fought a clever media war, and they are remarkably consistent in the messages that they deliver to their own people and their Western allies, as well as their enemies in Moscow.\n\nWishful thinking must play a part in the assessments they share with journalists.\n\nBut it is still worth spending time getting their views of the crisis that has engulfed the presidency of their mortal enemy Vladimir Putin.\n\nWithout doubt, he is facing the most serious challenge to his authority since he first became president in 2000.\n\nOther senior officials in Kyiv say they are convinced that Mr Putin is opposed by informal but organised networks of disenchanted insiders.\n\nIn his office, Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council, told the BBC that \"Prigozhin is not the most senior. They might become the new political elite\".\n\nMr Danilov said they included security forces, officials and representatives of Russia's oligarchs, who believe that Mr Putin's decision to launch a full invasion of Ukraine in February last year has been a personal disaster for them as well as a threat to Russia.\n\nMr Danilov, a man in his early sixties wearing a black military-style outfit with his surname on a badge on his chest, bristled for a moment when I asked if he had proof to back up his analysis.\n\n\"I'm not speculating,\" he insisted. \"We know who these people are, we know about their lives.\"\n\nMykhailo Podolyak said the Wagner mutiny did not last long enough to influence the fighting\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, another close adviser to President Zelensky, agreed there were \"several groups of people who want to take power in Russia\".\n\nThe system Mr Putin built, top-down and authoritarian, was, he claimed, being replaced by a near vacuum at the centre of power.\n\nAnother senior official, who spoke on condition he was not named, went further, suggesting that President Putin would be forced to dismiss his Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of Staff General Valery Gerasimov, perhaps as a response to another military setback.\n\nFiring the two men was a key demand of Yevgeny Prigozhin and his Wagner mutineers.\n\n\"Prigozhin will get what he wanted,\" the official predicted. \"His political life is not finished. He won't stay in exile in Belarus.\"\n\nAs for Ukraine's offensive, Mr Podolyak said the Wagner mutiny did not last long enough to influence the fighting along a front of 1,800 kilometres, the longest - he said - in any war since 1945.\n\nIt is clear to the most dispassionate observer of the war that Ukraine is having to fight very hard, and take casualties in troops and equipment, including the armour supplied by Nato.\n\nWhen I asked the official who wanted to remain anonymous about recent tactical gains in the east, including a handful of small villages, he lifted his hand with his finger and thumb pinching the air perhaps half an inch apart.\n\nHis message was that progress has been slow, painful and limited, though he expressed hope that might change.\n\nSenior Ukrainians are still doing their best to manage expectations about the summer offensive. They believe some of their Western allies, as well as supporters in the media, have become over-excited about Ukraine's army and its Nato equipment.\n\nSome Ukrainian officials acknowledged the fear that gives Western leaders sleepless nights, that a public collapse of President Putin's regime might lead to real danger as his would-be successors jockey for power in a state with the world's biggest arsenal of nuclear weapons.\n\nThat prospect is sure to be high on the agenda of the Nato summit, due to meet in Lithuania next month.\n\nPresident Zelensky and his advisers want the summit to give them a firm and unequivocal path to Nato membership. They believe the best answer to the instability in Russia is to present an iron wall to Moscow.\n\nBut the uncertainty surrounding President Putin and his regime, almost a year and a half into a disastrous war and after the Wagner drama, might feed the anxiety of those Nato countries who would prefer the war to end around the negotiating table, not on the battlefield.\n\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.", "The inquiry heard Derek Roan was a respected member of the farming community\n\nAn attack by a cow that had recently given birth resulted in the death of a farmer in the south of Scotland, an inquiry has concluded.\n\nDerek Roan, 71, had tried to move the 550kg (1,200lbs) Galloway beef cow with her calf back to the main herd.\n\nHe died of severe chest trauma after the accident at Barnbarroch Farm near Dalbeattie in June last year.\n\nSheriff Joanna McDonald concluded there were no reasonable precautions that could have avoided Mr Roan's death.\n\nThere were also no defects found in working systems.\n\nAn inquiry was held at Dumfries Sheriff Court into the accident on the family-owned farm on 19 June 2022.\n\nThe family had featured on BBC Two's This Farming Life.

Talks are ongoing to try to secure the extra funding.\n\nCommenting on claims the regulator had failed to stop big water firms getting into debt, Mr Black said that suppliers were responsible for their financial structures, not Ofwat, which was tasked with protecting customers.\n\nWater companies across England and Wales need to submit their business plans for 2025-2030 to Ofwat by 2 October.

In July that year, first-time mother Ms Mulcahy died from an infection caused by the same virus at the William Harvey Hospital in Ashford.\n\nBoth women had their babies delivered at hospitals run by the East Kent NHS trust\n\nMs Woods said that when, Ms Sampson's condition was not responding to antibiotics, the possibility of a viral infection should have been considered earlier.\n\nWhen Ms Mulcahy became ill six weeks later, medical teams were aware of Ms Sampson's death but did not start antiviral treatment at an early stage because the cause of her symptoms were not clear.\n\nThe inquest has heard how Ms Sampson needed a blood transfusion because of injuries sustained during the operation. After two days, she asked to be discharged with her baby and went home with her mother despite being in a lot of pain.\n\nHer condition deteriorated and she was readmitted to the maternity ward a few days later. Doctors thought she was suffering from bacterial sepsis, a potentially very serious condition, and treated her with antibiotics.\n\nShe was transferred to King's College Hospital in south London but her condition did not improve and she died on 22 May.\n\nMs Mulcahy had her baby by Caesarean section on 26 June and developed a fever the following day - she was given antibiotics but did not improve.\n\nDoctors again thought she was suffering from sepsis and on 30 June she was transferred to intensive care, but medical teams were unable to save her and she died on the morning of 4 July.\n\nMs Mulcahy's mother Nicola Foster said members of the trust had behaved as if they were untouchable\n\nThe coroner said deaths from herpes were incredibly rare. The virus, HSV-1 or herpes simplex is a common infection that can cause sores around the mouth or genitals, but if contracted after giving birth, it is \"a potentially fatal disease\" Ms Woods said.\n\nShe said she would be writing to the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology to highlight the dangers of the condition in new mothers.\n\nShe subsequently ruled out conclusions of unlawful killing and neglect, which lawyers for the women's families had argued for. The coroner is expected to give narrative conclusions for both Ms Sampson and Ms Mulcahy on 26 July.\n\nSpeaking after the inquest, Ms Mulcahy's mother, Nicola Foster, said: \"The trust have been untruthful, dismissive, and members of the trust staff, including surgeons, doctors have behaved arrogantly, defensively, as if they are untouchable.\n\n\"Both families will always believe that the deaths of Kim and Sam were because of something they acquired whilst in hospital and we have no reason to believe otherwise.\"\n\nYvette Sampson said her five-year fight for answers had left her unable to grieve\n\nMs Sampson's mother Yvette said her fight for answers, which has now been going on for five years, has left her unable to grieve properly.\n\nShe said: \"It's consumed my life\u2026 It's been emotionally draining. It's changed me as a person. I'm a lot less trusting and still find it hard to comprehend how the hospital trust has acted in the way it has.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for East Kent Hospitals NHS said: \"We would like to express our sincere condolences to the families of Samantha Mulcahy and Kimberley Sampson. We are unable to comment further until the inquest has concluded.\"\n\nIn March, the coroner accepted an application from the NHS trust to give anonymity to the surgeon common to both cases.\n\nThe surgeon who operated on both women, who could not be named for legal reasons, previously told the hearing his hands were fully scrubbed, double gloved and he was wearing a mask during both procedures. He also said he had no lesions and was not infected but had not been tested for the virus.\n\nMs Wood adjourned her decision over the anonymity until the hearing on 26 July.\n\nFollow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram.

More than 125,000 applied for design, creative and performing arts courses.\n\nSubjects allied to medicine, social sciences, biological and sports sciences, and engineering and technology were all more popular than computing.\n\nHowever, the numbers applying for computer-related courses have risen every year since 2019, UCAS said.\n\nThis year software engineering saw the steepest rise in applications, up 16% compared to last year. Computer science attracted 11% more applicants. There was a 2% rise in students applying to study computer games and animation, and 4% in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe increased interest in computing courses may in part be down to a growing public conversation around technology and artificial intelligence, Ms Marchant said.\n\n\"We know that changes in the world around us translate into increased demand for certain courses, as we saw for economics post-2008, and for medicine and nursing during the Covid-19 pandemic,\" she said.\n\nChris Derrick, deputy headteacher at Kelvinside Academy in Glasgow said pupils applying for computing courses now were all \"digital natives\" who have \"honed and developed these skills from a young age using powerful tech every day\".\n\n\"Programming knowledge is also so accessible via YouTube and ChatGPT,\" he said.\n\n\"Pupils can explore their passions and learn at pace. If they don't have an answer, Google and YouTube will,\" he said.\n\nWhile much of the public discussion recently has been around which jobs will be replaced by AI, there are also a growing number of employment opportunities related to AI, data science, software design and computing technologies.\n\nThere was also an increase in the number of applications by UK 18-year-olds from the most disadvantaged backgrounds, UCAS said.\n\nHowever, computing remains a male-dominated subject, with only 18% of applications for computer-related studies coming from female students, up slightly, from 17% in 2022 and 16% in 2021.\n\nThe total number of UK 18-year-old applicants was over 319,500, the second highest it has been, a slight decrease on last year.\n\nRashik Parmar, chief executive of BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT said: \"Teenagers in the UK know that AI will change the world forever; it shouldn't surprise us to see this soaring demand for computing degrees\".\n\nVanessa Wilson from the University Alliance - an association of British universities - agreed that greater public interest in AI in recent months might have contributed to more interest from applicants.\n\n\"The rise in the popularity of computing may well be a response to increasing awareness of the role of technologies such as AI, as well as a strong desire from students to develop what they see as future-proof skills,\" she said.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

She had decades of therapy. So she felt guilt and deep remorse.\"\n\nCharles Manson, considered one of America's most notorious cult leaders, directed his followers to commit nine murders and hoped the killings would start a race war, called \"Helter Skelter\" after a famous song by the Beatles. He died in prison in 2017.\n\nFollowing her life sentence, Van Houten earned both a bachelors and masters degree while in prison, where she also worked as a tutor for other inmates.\n\nAfter being denied parole dozens of times during her incarceration, Van Houten was finally recommended for parole in 2016.

This refers to costs the prisoner would have incurred if they had not been locked up, such as food and accommodation, according to a House of Commons briefing paper.\n\nSir Bob, who is chairman of the Justice Select Committee, said that at the time the decision was made, it was thought that taxpayers would be offended at paying money to someone who was freed on a technicality.\n\nHe said Mr Malkinson, however, was not cleared on a technicality, but on DNA evidence.\n\n\"This was a serious miscarriage of justice,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\n\"It's clearly not right that somebody who was deprived of their liberty, because of the failures of the state and its institutions for a number of years, then should pay the state or be obliged to give some money back to the state, for the privilege of having been wrongly incarcerated.\n\n\"That surely offends any any kind of sense of justice,\" he added.\n\nHe said he would like ministers to change the rules to protect those wrongly convicted from paying such costs.\n\n\"The sums involved are trivial in the overall scheme of things,\" he said.\n\nThe maximum payment in cases where someone has been in jail for more than 10 years is \u00a31m.\n\nA Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \"This was a deeply troubling case and we recognise the pain of any individual punished for a crime they did not commit - which is why we continue to support the work of the independent Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC).\n\n\"It is only right victims of miscarriages of justice can apply for compensation and that all requests are properly assessed independent of government.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Belarus is a key Russian ally and served as a launchpad for the invasion.\n\nHowever, the Ukrainian government updated its position on Wednesday, granting permission for its athletes to compete against Russians and Belarusians who participate as neutrals, as is the case at the World Fencing Championships.\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, the adviser to Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky, shared a photo on his Twitter feed which appeared to show Anna Smirnova with a Russian soldier.\n\n\"The photo features Anna Smirnova, the Russian fencer who Ukrainian Olga Kharlan refused to shake hands with at the World Championships after winning a fair bout,\" Podolyak said.\n\n\"As you can see, she openly admires the Russian army, which is killing Ukrainians and destroying our cities.

Another soldier was wounded in that exchange.\n\nIn a vaguely worded statement, the Egyptian military said that its security officer was pursuing drug smugglers and that a shooting led to the Israeli deaths.\n\nIt also conveyed \"sincere condolences\" to the families of the victims.\n\nThe Israeli military says contraband worth about $400,000 was seized by its forces during the overnight operation against smugglers.\n\nThe attacks reportedly happened near Mount Harif military base in the Negev desert\n\nSoldiers are continuing to search in the area for others that may have been involved, the army says. It is not clear how the policeman managed to enter Israel from Egypt.\n\nIsraeli media say the attacks happened between Mount Harif and Mount Sagi - which lie in the Negev desert, about half-way between the Mediterranean coast and the Red Sea Israeli resort of Eilat.\n\nIsraeli military spokesman Richard Hecht told journalists: \"Co-operation with the Egyptians is ongoing, it's good. This is not geopolitical.\"\n\nThis appears to be one of the most serious border incidents since Egypt became the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel in 1979.\n\nAlthough the two states are often described as having \"a cold peace\" in recent years, they have worked together closely on military and intelligence matters, particularly on counter-terrorism.\n\nThe Israeli air force has supported the Egyptian army in its fight against so-called Islamic State militants in the northern part of the Sinai Peninsula.\n\nThe most serious infiltration attempt in recent times took place in 2012.\n\nBack then, militants attacked an Egyptian checkpoint near to Rafah on the border with the Gaza Strip, killing 16 Egyptian policemen and stealing two armoured cars.\n\nThey used these to break through the Kerem Shalom border crossing with Israel where one of the vehicles exploded. After a firefight, Israel said the bodies of eight attackers were found.\n\nIn the past decade, Israel has built a tall border fence to try to keep out militants and to stop people-smuggling from Egypt - in particular migrants crossing from sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nHowever, drug smuggling attempts in the area remain frequent. The border stretches some 255km (160 miles), making it difficult for security patrols.\n\nRecent years have seen several cases of gunfire between smugglers and Israeli soldiers. The Egyptian army has also shot at drug smugglers and jihadists which has occasionally led to accidental cross-border fire.\n\nLast December, Israeli soldiers shot dead a suspect who was apparently trying to smuggle drugs into Israel.", "Day paper travelcards will no longer be issued under plans\n\nDay travelcards will be phased out, the deputy mayor of London has confirmed.\n\nThe daily paper tickets will no longer be sold or accepted on Transport for London (TfL) services including Tube, bus, rail, tram and London Overground.\n\nSeb Dance told the rail minister \"TfL can no longer afford\" to fund the \u00a340m Travelcard Agreement \"which represents a subsidy by Londoners\".\n\nPassengers travelling from outside the capital will be expected to use contactless or Oyster cards on arrival.\n\nLast year, 12m day travelcards were sold, double the number in Covid-hit 2020, but down from 27m in 2018.\n\nWeekly and annual travelcards will still be issued but last year just 20,000 of the latter were sold, down from 185,000 in 2018.\n\nTravelcards offer unlimited travel on services within London, where fares rose an average of 5.9% in March.\n\nIn a letter sent to rail minister Huw Merriman on Friday, Mr Dance said \"the current price paid to TfL for these tickets is well below the price paid for the same tickets sold within London\".\n\nA consultation document sets out the changes, which would see the end of paper travelcards altogether.\n\n\"We anticipate that, if TfL ceases to accept day travelcards, rail operators will also stop selling Zone 1-6 travelcards,\" it states.\n\nChild day travelcards would no longer be available, meaning those outside of London would have to apply for a Zipcard, which provides free and discounted travel for those aged under 18, in advance of coming to the capital.\n\nA spokesperson for the mayor of London said: \"The mayor is only considering the withdrawal of day travelcards in order to meet the requirements of TfL's funding settlement with government - a deal that was required solely because of the impact of the pandemic.\n\n\"He has been clear he does not want to do so but feels that he has been left with no viable alternative.\"\n\nA Department for Transport spokesperson said: \"We have provided TfL with more than \u00a36bn in funding support to keep public transport moving.\n\n\"Transport in London is devolved, and any decision to withdraw from the travelcard agreement is a matter for the mayor.\"\n\nFollow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

He also worked at the World Bank and European Commission as well as writing a number of books on environmental issues.\n\nAsked about the reports, Mr Jenrick - who served for two years in Mr Johnson's cabinet as housing secretary - said: \"Is it, as a principle, wise for a prime minister to nominate a member of their own family for an honour? No, absolutely not.\"\n\nHe added that \"we'll have to see what ultimately is on this list and what the government chooses to do\".\n\nThere have been calls for Mr Sunak to block Stanley Johnson from being given a knighthood if his name is put forward.\n\nAs prime minister, Mr Johnson nominated his brother Jo - a former Conservative minister - to join the House of Lords.\n\nAlso speaking on Question Time, shadow Home Office minister Sarah Jones said Mr Sunak \"needs to make it crystal clear\" that Mr Johnson could not nominate his own father for an honour.\n\nReports this week have suggested that Mr Johnson was told by officials to cut the number of people on his list after initially proposing almost 100.\n\nOne ally of Mr Johnson's told the BBC his list was \"shorter than David Cameron's or Theresa May's so everyone can relax\".\n\nMr Cameron nominated 59 people for honours when he resigned, while Ms May nominated 51.\n\nA spokesman for Mr Johnson refused to comment on whether or not he planned to put his father forward for a knighthood.\n\nA Cabinet Office spokesperson said: \"We do not comment on speculation around honours\".", "Mabli Cariad Hall was \"beautiful, smiley and happy\", a family friend said in a tribute\n\nAn eight-month-old was in her pram outside a hospital when she was hit and killed by a car, an inquest has heard.\n\nMabli Cariad Hall was struck by a white BMW outside Withybush Hospital in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire in June, along with a pedestrian.\n\nShe died from a severe traumatic brain injury at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children four days later.\n\nIn a statement, her family said the loss of Mabli had changed their lives forever.\n\nThe inquest at Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire Coroner's Court was told that at 11:50 BST, the police received an emergency call of a crash involving a car and pedestrians.\n\nIt happened in front of the hospital's main entrance.\n\nDuring the inquest opening, coroner Paul Bennet said: \"I extend my sincere condolences to Mabli's parents and also to her grandparents who are here this morning.\"\n\n\"And to say how sorry I am that we have to meet in such difficult and tragic circumstances for you and the family,\" he added.\n\nMabli Hall died after being hit by a car outside Withybush Hospital\n\nMabli, from Neath, was airlifted from the hospital to Cardiff before being transferred to hospital in Bristol.\n\nHer funeral was held a week ago in Tonna, Neath Port Talbot.\n\nThe driver of the BMW suffered non-life-threatening injuries and was taken to hospital, along with their passenger and pedestrian, who was also hit.\n\n\"The pain and grief we are suffering as a family is indescribable,\" Mabli's family said in the statement.\n\n\"During this terribly painful time, we still have no answer to the central question we inevitably ask regarding the tragic loss of our beautiful baby girl.\"\n\nA damaged BMW was removed from Withybush Hospital in Haverfordwest\n\nThey added that the opening of the inquest and the Dyfed-Powys Police investigation would hopefully provide the information they needed to explain why the tragedy happened.\n\n\"As a family we also hope that the outcome of this process will help reduce the risk of such a tragedy happening to others in future,\" the family said.\n\nThe inquest was adjourned until 25 January 2024, pending a full investigation.", "The murals adorned the walls of the Kent Intake Unit\n\nMurals of Mickey Mouse and other cartoon characters designed to welcome child asylum seekers to a reception centre in Dover have been painted over, by order of the immigration minister.\n\nRobert Jenrick instructed that they be removed, reportedly because he believed they sent too welcoming a message.\n\nThe Home Office said the Kent Intake Unit (KIU) opened last November to look after unaccompanied child migrants.\n\nFacilities included softer interview rooms and an outside space, it added.\n\nThere were also prayer rooms, a larger reception area and improved security measures to ensure children's safety, the Home Office said.\n\nA spokesperson confirmed the murals were removed on Tuesday, adding: \"We do all we can to ensure children are safe, secure and supported as we urgently seek placements with a local authority.\n\n\"All children receive a welfare interview on their arrival at accommodation, which includes questions designed to identify potential indicators of trafficking or safeguarding issues.\n\n\"Our priority is to stop the boats and disrupt the people smugglers.\"\n\nLabour's shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock condemned Mr Jenrick's order, saying the idea that removing the murals would \"somehow stop the boats is utterly absurd\".\n\nHe said it was a sign of a \"chaotic government in crisis, whose failing approach means all they have left is tough talk and cruel and callous policies\".\n\nLabour had a plan to \"end the dangerous crossings, defeat the criminal smuggler gangs, and end hotel use by clearing the asylum backlog,\" he added.\n\nThe i newspaper, which was first to report the story, quoted sources as saying staff at the centre were \"horrified\" by Mr Jenrick's order and resisted carrying out the work.\n\nA report published last month by His Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons after visits to KIU, and the nearby processing centres at Manston and Western Jet Foil, found there had been improvements in facilities since previous inspections.\n\nBut continuing problems, including medical isolation practices at KIU. The report concluded: \"Inspectors found no examples of notable positive practice during this inspection\" at KIU.\n\nThe Home Office said it had taken action to address some of the recommendations.", "One of the UK's largest private pension funds has backed Thames Water to turnaround its finances and performance after fears the firm could collapse.\n\nUniversities Superannuation Scheme (USS), a major investor in the water firm, is the first to publicly support it as it looks to secure extra funding.\n\nThames Water is billions of pounds in debt and there have been calls for it to be nationalised.\n\nUSS said the firm \"could benefit\" from having it among its shareholders.\n\n\"We know that leakage and sewage remain major issues, but we also know there are no quick fixes where a complex network of pipes stretching for miles - some of which have been in the ground for 150 years - need to be replaced,\" said USS group chief executive Bill Galvin.\n\nMr Galvin added improvements would \"take time\" and added \"significant investment is needed\".\n\nThames Water, which serves a quarter of the UK population, has faced heavy criticism over its performance in recent years due to sewage discharges and leaks. The company leaks more water than any other water company in UK, losing the equivalent of up to 250 Olympic size swimming pools every day from its pipes.\n\nIts chief executive, Sarah Bentley, resigned last week, weeks after she was asked to forgo her bonus over the company's handling of sewage spills.\n\nThames Water is a private company, owned by a group of investors, with the largest being the Canadian pension fund, OMERS, with 31.8%.\n\nOMERS has declined to comment on the water firm's current situation, but USS, a pension fund for UK academics and the second biggest investor with a 19.7% stake, is the first to announce its support.\n\n\"We have given our backing to Thames Water's turnaround plan and Net Zero roadmap and engage with them regularly to support their long-term strategy,\" Mr Galvin said in note to staff, which was first reported by the Financial Times.\n\n\"We remain of the view that, with an appropriate regulatory environment, the long-term objective of repairing important UK infrastructure and paying pensions to our members are in strong alignment.\"\n\nThames Water said last week that it was trying to raise the cash it needs to improve.\n\nIt said it was keeping water regulator Ofwat informed on progress, and that it still had \"strong\" cash and borrowing reserves to draw on.\n\nThe government has said it was ready to act in a worst case scenario if Thames Water collapsed.\n\nRegardless of what happens, water supplies will continue as normal to customers.\n\nLast year Thames Water's owners - including USS - pumped \u00a3500m into the business and pledged a further \u00a31bn to help it to improve.\n\nBut the company is understood to be struggling to raise the remaining cash which it needs to service its substantial debt pile, which is around \u00a314bn. Interest payments on more than half of its debt are linked to the rate of inflation, which has soared over the last year.\n\nOther water firms are also facing similar pressures due to higher interest payments on their debts and rising costs including higher energy and chemical prices.", "Late on Thursday night, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) convened a meeting for a group of international journalists at the defence ministry building in Tel Aviv. The IDF then set out for us the results of their initial inquiry into the killing of seven aid workers in Gaza.\n\nRetired Maj Gen Yoav Har-Even described how the IDF's drone operators mistook an aid worker carrying a bag for a gunman, and then targeted one of the World Central Kitchen vehicles with a missile.\n\nThe IDF then described how two people escaped that vehicle and got into a second car, which was hit by another missile from a drone.\n\nThe military confirmed that there were survivors from the second explosion, who managed to get into the third vehicle - which was then also hit by a missile.\n\nBy the end, all the aid workers were dead.\n\nThe IDF's investigation concluded that the army unit involved had believed the vehicles they were tracking from the sky had been taken over by Hamas gunmen, and that they were not aware of the coordination procedures put in place between the military and World Central Kitchen for that evening.\n\nIt also said they also did not know the cars belonged to the charity, and the three air strikes were in violation of the army's own procedures.\n\nThree of the charity's cars were struck during the attack\n\nThe evidence from the investigation has been passed to the Military Advocate General - the Israeli army's top legal authority - to determine if there has been any criminal conduct.\n\nIn addition, the army has sacked the major in charge of fire support. The brigade's chief of staff, a colonel, has also been sacked. The divisional commander, brigade commander and the general in charge of the IDF's Southern Command have been formally reprimanded.\n\nThe IDF sought to explain the context leading up to the fatal events of that evening.\n\nThe aid workers had been overseeing the distribution of food aid that had arrived on a ship from Cyprus and unloaded at a recently constructed jetty in the northern Gaza strip. Under coordination with the IDF, the World Central Kitchen team were transferring these supplies to a warehouse a few kilometres further south.\n\nDuring this process, the IDF says their drone operators spotted a gunman riding on the roof of a large aid lorry that was being escorted by the WCK team. They played those of us at the briefing a somewhat blurry video - which has not been released to the public - showing a figure holding a gun, on top of the lorry. At one point the gun is fired, showing up clearly on the slowed-down black and white footage.\n\nAt this stage the military contacts World Central Kitchen but they are in turn unable to reach the team on the ground - where phone communication is patchy and aid agencies say they are prohibited by the IDF from using radios.\n\nThe drone footage also appears to confirm that at night, the stickers on the roof of the World Central Kitchen vehicles, with the charity's logo, are not visible to the drone operator.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: US says Israel must make changes in the coming \"hours and days\"\n\nThe military then tracks the convoy, including the aid lorry, to a warehouse. Then the convoy splits - the aid lorry remains in the warehouse and four SUV-type cars emerge. One of those vehicles heads north, and is then shown to contain gunmen, with weapons clearly visible from the drone footage, as they emerge next to another aid warehouse. The IDF say that these gunmen were not targeted, because of their proximity to an aid facility.\n\nMeanwhile, three remaining vehicles belonging to World Central Kitchen begin to head south.\n\nThe drone team, the army says, now working under the assumption that they are dealing with Hamas militants and not an aid convoy, had misidentified one of the aid workers as a gunman, and claimed to have seen them enter one of the three WCK cars.\n\nNo footage of this moment was provided, but the military investigation concluded that it was a \"misclassification... they saw that it's a rifle but at the end of the day it was a bag\".\n\nUnder the mistaken belief that one vehicle now contained a gunman, authorisation to fire a missile is sought, and granted by superior officers. At 23:09 the first vehicle is struck, two minutes later the second, and at 23:13 the third final, fatal strike is launched.\n\nThe military's conclusions are that three major failings occurred:", "Google has started rolling out its AI chatbot Bard, but it is only available to certain users and they have to be over the age of 18.\n\nUnlike its viral rival ChatGPT, it can access up-to-date information from the internet and has a \"Google it\" button which accesses search.\n\nIt also namechecks its sources for facts, such as Wikipedia.\n\nBut Google warned Bard would have \"limitations\" and said it might share misinformation and display bias.\n\nThis is because it \"learns\" from real-world information, in which those biases currently exist - meaning it is possible for stereotypes and false information to show up in its responses.\n\nAI chatbots are programmed to answer questions online using natural, human-like language.\n\nThey can write anything from speeches and marketing copy to computer code and student essays.\n\nWhen ChatGPT launched in November 2022, it had more than one million users within a week, said OpenAI, the firm behind it.\n\nMicrosoft has invested billions of dollars in it, incorporating the product into its search engine Bing last month.\n\nIt has also unveiled plans to bring a version of the tech to its office apps including Word, Excel and Powerpoint.\n\nGoogle has been a slower and more cautious runner in the generative AI race with its version, Bard, which launches in the US and UK to begin with. Users will have to register to try it out.\n\nBard is a descendant of an earlier language model of Google's called Lamda, which was never fully released to the public. It did, however, attract a lot of attention when one of the engineers who worked on it claimed its answers were so compelling that he believed it was sentient. Google denied the claims and he was fired.\n\nBard can be interacted with much like a Google search\n\nGoogle senior product director Jack Krawczyk has told the BBC that Bard is \"an experiment\" and he hopes people will use it as a \"launchpad for creativity\".\n\nHe showed me an example of how he had used Bard to help him plan his young child's birthday party.\n\nIt came up with a theme which incorporated his child's love of bunny rabbits and gymnastics, found the address of a venue he mentioned and suggested party games and food.\n\n\"So much of the [media] coverage is that AI is the hero,\" said Mr Krawczyk. \"I think the human is the hero and large language models are here to help unlock creativity.\"\n\nWhile ChatGPT's knowledge database only extends as far as the year 2021 - it cannot, for example, answer questions about the recent earthquake in Turkey and Syria - Bard can access current information. It explained to me a news story about TikTok being banned on UK government phones, published on the BBC website a few days ago.\n\nIt is programmed not to respond to offensive prompts and has filters to prevent it from sharing harmful, illegal, sexually explicit or personally identifiable information but \"like any method these guardrails will occasionally fail\", said Zoubin Ghahramani, vice president of Google Research.\n\nMake no mistake, this is an extremely cautious product launch, about as far away from the former \"move fast and break things\" bravado of the early days of big tech as it is possible to get.\n\nWhen I asked if the firm was nervous, Mr Krawczyk paused before answering that its approach to the launch of Bard was \"deliberate\".\n\nIf Google is nervous, it has good reason to be.\n\nFor all the excitement that exists around this kind of tech, there are horror stories about some of the more disturbing things ChatGPT has been manipulated into doing, and there are also fears that ultimately these powerful tools, still currently in their infancy, could be a huge threat to lots of different types of jobs.\n\nThere is also - and this is particularly relevant to Google - a theory that chatbots could one day replace the lucrative business of internet search altogether. Why wade through pages of search result links when you could just get one neatly written answer? Google cannot afford to be out of the race.\n\nMr Krawczyk and Mr Ghahramani talked a lot about the responsibility and principles that comes with the tech. They even told me about the huge data centres powering Bard, and how they aim to run them using renewable energy.\n\nGoogle is advising its users not to trust everything Bard says\n\nThey revealed Google was restricting access to over-18s when I asked whether students would start using Bard to do their homework instead of ChatGPT. Teachers have warned pupils not to use chatbots to do their work for them although some educators have embraced it.\n\nGoogle says it will be closely monitoring Bard to make sure it adheres to its own \"AI principles\" which include avoiding the creation or reinforcement of bias.\n\nIt will not be able to express opinions or take on a persona, although like ChatGPT it will be able to mimic the writing styles of others.\n\nIt helped Google write its own announcement, said the firm's Sissie Hsiao and Eli Collins, who were also co-authors of the launch blog post.\n\n\"It didn't always get things right. But even then, it made us laugh,\" they said.", "As Manchester City lifted the trophy, five men were awaiting sentencing for illegally streaming Premier League matches\n\nFive men who illegally streamed Premier League football matches to tens of thousands of people have been jailed.\n\nThe gang sold cut-price \u00a310-a-month subscriptions, bragging they made money showing games not otherwise available to watch live in the UK because of \"blackout\" broadcasting rules.\n\nTheir operation, described as the biggest so far, received more than \u00a37m from 50,000 subscribers.\n\nThe sentencing follows a rare private prosecution by the Premier League.\n\nThe fraud prosecution was brought to protect \"some of the world's most valuable content\", the league's lawyers said.\n\nIt followed a lengthy trading-standards investigation led by Hammersmith and Fulham Council.\n\nAnd the personal details of many of those who paid for Flawless TV are now in the hands of investigators, raising the question of what action might be taken against them.\n\nBodycam images show Mark Gould on his sofa as investigators searched his south London flat\n\nAt Derby Crown Court, the gang's \"prime mover\", Mark Gould, 36, was sentenced to 11 years in prison.\n\nFour other members were sentenced to between three and more than five years.\n\nOne of them, Christopher Felvus, 36, was also found guilty of voyeurism and possessing indecent images of children, discovered on his computer.\n\n\"I don't think any of us realised how big it was,\" Mr Love tells BBC News.\n\nInvestigators found dozens of linked set-top boxes at the flat\n\n\"When we went into the spare bedroom, there were 20 or 30 set-top boxes linked together.\"\n\nThe gang took feeds from broadcasters in the UK, Qatar, the US, Australia and Canada and streamed them a few seconds later via the Flawless service.\n\nThe operation developed apps offering Premier League matches and other content, which ran on phones and smart TVs.\n\nUsers picked what they wanted to watch from a fully-functional on-screen programme guide.\n\nThe gang made \u00a37.2m between 2016 and 2021, according to the league. Gould personally made more than \u00a31.7m.\n\nDirect subscribers paid \u00a310 a month to watch every Premier League game, compared with about \u00a380 a month for legal services from Sky, BT Sport and Amazon Prime.\n\nThe case has highlighted a demand for illegal streaming, created by the unavailability of many football matches on TV.\n\nUefa allows the Premier League to prevent broadcasts of UK matches between 14:45 and 17:15 on Saturdays.\n\nThe \"blackout\", in place for decades, is to encourage fans to attend matches, at all levels of football, rather than watch on TV.\n\nBut Flawless offered subscribers \"3pm kick-off\" Premier League games, otherwise broadcast only abroad.\n\nThe gang had exchanged messages saying the \"blackout\" was \"good for business\", accounting for 80% of subscribers, prosecutor David Groome told the court.\n\nResearch from the Intellectual Property Office estimates nearly four million people in the UK used an illegal source to watch live sport last year.\n\nSome pubs and bars also use illegal streams to show unavailable matches, or to avoid the cost of official services, which can be more than \u00a320,000 a year for commercial premises.\n\nFans point out while most games are not televised in the UK, they are all shown live overseas.\n\n\"The Premier League is on our doorstep and yet we have the least amount of access to that football,\" YouTuber Daniel Bradley, also known as FPL Mate, says.\n\n\"I would pay more for more - but I don't have that option.\"\n\nWhen the investigators raided the homes of gang members, they seized computer equipment and documents detailing the operation of Flawless.\n\nAs a result, they now have payment information for thousands of those who subscribed to the service.\n\nThe Premier League pays the Federation Against Copyright Theft to investigate and enforce its copyright over football content.\n\nFact visits those identified as using illegal football streaming, warning them they are potentially breaking the law, as well as issuing \"cease and desist\" letters to those running streams.\n\nBut it seems highly unlikely fans will face legal action.\n\nOne of the barristers who worked on the Flawless case, Ari Alibhai, said, in an online seminar, in 2021: \"In practice, the idea of someone being prosecuted who isn't also concerned in the trade, so they aren't also concerned in supplying illicit television services, is minimal.\"\n\nBut fans thinking of subscribing to illegal streams could be setting themselves up for another headache.\n\n\"You get sports and you are getting a cheap price,\" Mr Love says. \"But you're committing an offence and putting yourself in danger.\n\n\"You are contributing to organised crime who won't be paying taxes and can make a quick buck by selling your details on.\"\n\nThese could be used to steal money or hack computers. The streaming sites themselves are also riddled with malware and pornography.\n\nProsecutors in the Flawless case described the lengths to which gangs would go to avoid detection, in a cat-and-mouse game between broadcasters and illegal streamers.\n\nSky adds a code on screen during its broadcasts, which acts as a watermark, so it can determine which legitimate accounts are being used for offering illegal streaming.\n\nBut the Flawless gang developed software to blur the watermark - and so Sky randomised its on-screen position to prevent that.\n\nCovert \"test purchases\" and subscriptions are also used in the fight against copyright theft, helping the Premier League take down 590,000 streams in 2021.\n\nBut it remains big business - and when Flawless was shut down, other services were quick to take over, amid complaints from users online.\n\nThe investigation into the gang continues, with the aim of seizing the illegal money they made.\n\nThe Premier League's legal team say they will now pursue other illegal streaming operators.\n\n\"The Premier League's substantial financial contribution to the entire football pyramid is made possible through the ability to sell our broadcast rights,\" the league's general counsel, Kevin Plumb, said.\n\n\"We are pleased that through rulings such as this, the courts continue to show that they recognise the importance of safeguarding the Premier League's rights.\n\n\"We will continue to protect our rights and our fans by investigating and prosecuting illegal operators at all levels.\"", "CCTV footage of a fast food restaurant drive-through shows the moment a worker pulled a gun on a customer after an argument over missing fries.\n\nThe incident took place in March 2021 in Houston, Texas.\n\nThe driver\u2019s family has since filed a lawsuit against Jack-in-the-Box and its employee, Alonniea Ford-Theriot.", "The shooting occurred at a memorial for Fresia Calderon and her daughter Sara Sanchez\n\nA 19-year-old man has been charged, and two other men arrested, over a drive-by shooting during a funeral outside a church in central London.\n\nFour women and two girls were injured in the incident in Euston in January.\n\nAlrico Nelson Martin, from Kilburn, north-west London, has been charged with possession of a shotgun with intent to endanger life.\n\nA further two men, aged 22 and 23, have been arrested for conspiracy to murder and remain in custody.\n\nFour women and two girls, aged 11 and seven, were shot outside a funeral at St Aloysius Church in Phoenix Road.\n\nThe shooting happened close to a church while a funeral was taking place, police say\n\nMourners had been attending the funeral of Sara Sanchez, 20, who died from leukaemia in November and her mother, Fresia Calderon, who died the same month.\n\nMs Sanchez had suffered from leukaemia for three years, while her mother died from a rare blood clot on arrival at Heathrow from Colombia.\n\nMr Martin, who is also charged with six counts of conspiracy to wound with intent, will appear later at Willesden Magistrates' Court.\n\nThe Met said a 22-year-old man arrested in Barnet, north London, on 15 January has been released on bail pending further inquiries.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "Japanese TV personality Ryuchell has been found dead by their manager at the agency's office in Tokyo.\n\nThe 27-year-old's cause of death has not yet been confirmed, but police said they are investigating if they took their own life.\n\nRyuchell married a fellow model, Peco in 2016 and the pair had a son.\n\nIn August 2022, the couple divorced after Ryuchell announced they no longer identified as male, attracting much criticism online.\n\nIn the post shared to Instagram, Ryuchell said they would still live with Peco and their son.\n\nBut many accused the celebrity of being an absent father and criticised their decision to come out.

by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission\n\nSome schools in Northern Ireland are teaching pupils that homosexuality is wrong in relationships and sex education (RSE).\n\nA Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission (NIHRC) report said \"many schools use language that shames and stigmatises young people\" who had sex.\n\nSome told pupils that those who \"engage in casual sex must bear the consequences of their actions\".\n\nThe NIHRC investigated schools policies on the teaching of RSE.\n\nThe detailed investigation found most schools were not providing \"age-appropriate, comprehensive and scientifically accurate education on access to abortion services\".\n\n\"Some schools actively contributed to the shame and stigma surrounding unplanned pregnancy and abortion, by making statements such as 'abortion is not a means of contraception and those who knowingly engage in casual sex must bear the consequences of their actions',\" the NIHRC report said.\n\nIt also said about two-thirds of post-primaries promoted abstinence in their sex education policies.\n\nOne school's policy stated that \"sexual abstinence before marriage and fidelity within it, will be presented as the positive and desirable option and an achievable reality\".\n\nThe commission recommended that schools should be monitored to ensure sex education is taught in \"an objective and non-judgemental manner\".\n\nThat should include \"detailed assessments of the content and delivery of lesson plans\".\n\nThe NIHRC was established following the Good Friday Agreement.\n\nIt has the power to conduct investigations and compel evidence.\n\nIts investigation into relationships and sex education focused mainly on legal and policy matters but it also made recommendations on delivery of the subject in schools.\n\nAbout three-quarters (149) of post-primaries in Northern Ireland provided evidence to the commission's investigation and 124 provided their RSE policies.\n\nSome schools provided lesson plans and teaching notes, and experts were also consulted by the commission.\n\nSpeaking about the findings, NIHRC chief commissioner, Alyson Kilpatrick told Good Morning Ulster that \"an awful lot more needed to be done by a majority of schools in relation to age appropriate, comprehensive, scientifically accurate education and sexual reproductive health and rights\".\n\n\"The Department for Education needs to work with schools, consult with parents and children, to work out what the appropriate content should be and that it is delivered properly,\" said Ms Kilpatrick.\n\nIn 2018, the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) said RSE in Northern Ireland should be compulsory and comprehensive.\n\nAs a result, the Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris recently laid new regulations in parliament making teaching topics like abortion and prevention of pregnancy compulsory in schools in Northern Ireland.\n\nHe said he had a legal duty to act on the recommendations made in the CEDAW report.\n\nBut the change has been criticised by Protestant and Catholic church leaders.\n\nThe NIHRC investigation into RSE was carried out before Mr Heaton-Harris's move.\n\nBut the commission said that there must be monitoring to \"ensure that schools are meeting their new obligations\".\n\n\"It's very easy to have a policy or to have a list of things you are going to teach, but it is the actual teaching of them and the way in which they are taught which is so influential,\" said Ms Kilpatrick.\n\nAt present, each school in Northern Ireland has to teach sex education but can decide what to teach \"based on the ethos of their school,\" according to Department of Education (DE) guidance.\n\nThe NIHRC said that the majority of schools who submitted their RSE policy to the investigation \"still promoted the value of the 'sanctity of marriage'\", and related terms, such as \"permanent committed sexual relationship\", and \"married love\" in their RSE policies and school ethos.\n\n\"In addition to this idealisation and promotion of abstinence, marriage, and monogamy, many schools use language that shames and stigmatises young people who do engage in sexual practices,\" the report continued.\n\n\"Most schools also contributed to this association of shame with sexual activity, by attributing specific moral values and personal characteristics to those who engaged (or did not engage) in sexual behaviour.\"\n\nThe NIHRC said about two-thirds of post-primaries taught pupils about contraception, but it was difficult to know if they offered accurate information.\n\nIn their RSE policies, some schools stated that \"they will present the Catholic teaching that 'the use of any artificial means of preventing procreation is not acceptable',\" the report said.\n\n\"Some schools even outline their beliefs that \"homosexuality\" is wrong,\" in their polices, the NIHRC said.\n\n\"For example, one [school] writes that 'the belief that homosexual acts are against the nature and purpose of human relationships will be presented to pupils',\" the report continued.\n\nOne third of schools who provided information to the NIHRC said their school would teach pupils that \"heterosexual relationships was the 'main' or 'ideal' context for sexual intimacy\".\n\nThe report also said most schools \"indirectly contribute to the societal victim-blaming and slut-shaming of women and girls.\"\n\nIt said this was because they focused on how young people could stop themselves becoming victims of

But the death of Caversham Primary School's head teacher, Ruth Perry, feels like one of those rare moments when something fundamental has altered in public perception.\n\nMs Perry took her own life in January, weeks after an Ofsted inspection. The Ofsted report, published after her death, downgraded her school's rating from Outstanding to Inadequate - going from the top to the bottom of the scale.\n\nIt's as though a dam has burst, with her family blaming her death on the pressure of the inspection and head teachers and teachers coming forward to talk about their own experiences of the Ofsted process.\n\nFor some, the prospect of another inspection leads them to leave teaching altogether. Others describe the mental and physical toll of knowing your career is on the line.\n\nThere has always been background grumbling in schools about inspection, which has been a feature of our school system for more than 100 years.\n\nIn recent years though, there has been a more negative edge to conversations I have had in schools. Even a passing mention of Ofsted has led to spontaneous booing at a couple of professional gatherings of head teachers and teachers.\n\nIt's fair to describe the system as having high accountability and high stakes. A damning Ofsted report can have a domino effect in which the head teacher loses their job and teaching posts remain vacant, as few want to work in a school that has been labelled as failing. That, in turn, makes improvement harder.\n\nThis is at the heart of the question of whether Ofsted inspections improves schools or simply points out where they are struggling. Some argue the external scrutiny is vital to hold schools to account and maintain standards.\n\nEngland's schools have improved their ranking in some international league tables in recent years, but there is no way of being sure how Ofsted has contributed to that. Other things that might have boosted performance include the introduction of phonics to help primary school children learn to read, and making GCSEs more academically demanding.\n\nHead teachers of schools in deprived and challenged communities complain vociferously about Ofsted, which some feel is weighted against them. A report published in 2022 found schools that were stuck in a cycle of repeatedly weak Ofsted performances tended to have higher numbers of disadvantaged pupils.\n\nThe former chief inspector of schools, Sir Michael Wilshaw, is among Ofsted supporters who say the one-word rating system helps to give clear guidance to parents as they try to choose the best school for their child. But the events around Ms Perry's death have intensified the debate about whether one rating can fully describe a school.\n\nFor more than a decade, schools graded Outstanding became exempt from inspection. But since 2020, re-inspections have led to hundreds of previously Outstanding schools being downgraded.\n\nMs Perry's school in Reading, which hadn't been inspected for 13 years, is one of only five out of 359 schools to be moved to the bottom grade since September.\n\nConservative backbenchers have questioned in Parliament whether all these judgements are fair.\n\nMs Perry's school was rated as inadequate overall, despite providing a good education and a welcoming and vibrant community for children. The inadequate rating was driven by failings in training, record-keeping and checks on staff.\n\nPerhaps it's no surprise that in some of these inspections of previously Outstanding schools, one focus has been what measures are in place to keep children safe: Ofsted has been facing pressure to do more about preventing sexual assault in schools, and in October, the Independent Inquiry into Child Sex Abuse found the regulator \"did not do enough\" to identify serious child weaknesses in some educational settings.\n\nRuth Perry was the head teacher at Caversham Primary School in Reading\n\nSo where does this debate leave parents who simply want to know what to take from an Ofsted grade, as one part of deciding where to send their children to school?\n\nOne recent piece of research shows how difficult it is to be sure. The academics looked at 10 years of Ofsted inspections of secondary schools and how that related to GCSE results five years later.\n\nOnce they had taken account of children's backgrounds, and how well they had done already at school, there was \"no detectable difference\" between Good, Requires Improvement and Inadequate.\n\nWhether or not the huge reaction to Ruth Perry's death influences how Ofsted operates, change is certainly on the way for the regulator - chief inspector Amanda Spielman, is standing down at the end of the year.\n\nAnd while the government strongly supports the current system, the Labour Party has recently said it wants to move from a single-grade system to a report card system for each school, which would replace grades with more detailed information about school performance.", "Talks to resolve a long-running row with Royal Mail staff over pay and conditions are close to collapse.\n\nDiscussions are \"precarious\" and in their \"last throes\", with the next 24-48 hours key to settling the dispute, a source close to the talks said.\n\nThe Royal Mail board is reported as threatening to put the firm into administration if a deal is not done.\n\nThe BBC understands that there may be movement on the current pay offer to unions to try and resolve the issues.\n\n\"Administration is a real possibility for Royal Mail if the industrial action continues.

Rush would chair all-staff meetings at its headquarters, while his wife Wendy - another member of Princeton's class of 1984 - was his director of communications.\n\nA junior employee who worked at OceanGate from 2017 to 2018, and asked not to be identified, said the company headquarters felt homey and lived-in, with wiring and equipment seemingly everywhere. \"It was very free-flowing.\"\n\n\"He was just really passionate about what he was doing and very good at instilling that passion into everybody else that worked there,\" the employee told the BBC.\n\nAt one staff meeting, Mr Rush brought virtual reality goggles for everyone to take a digital underwater tour. Mr Rush told them that this is what they were aiming for - to allow more people to have this view. \"This is the world I want,\" he told them.\n\nMr Rush was \"not a leader from the back, telling people what to do - he led from the front\", said Mr Newman, the investor.\n\nMr Newman went on the Titan with Mr Rush to see the wreck of the Titanic in the summer of 2021.\n\nThe first time they met, Mr Rush \"spent hours\" talking with him about the potential of exploring the bottom of the ocean.\n\nMr Rush \"followed his own path\", Mr Newman said.\n\nMr Newman's recollection of OceanGate was of a team that looked out for each other.\n\nAnd Mr Rush's wife, Wendy, was \"up at the top, looking over his shoulder, making sure that he was doing everything perfectly and not cutting corners or skipping things\", he said.\n\nMr Newman was so taken by Mr Rush that he decided to invest in OceanGate. \"You know, I didn't know if I'd ever see any return or not. That was not the point,\" he said.\n\n\"The point was to be part of something that's experimental and is breaking new ground, and pushing forward our technology, and how the world works, and going places and doing amazing things, that's what this is about.\"\n\nMr Newman described himself as a minor investor. As a private company, OceanGate is not obliged to publish all financial records. US financial records from January 2020 show that Mr Rush and his fellow directors sold a stake in the company worth $18m, thought to have been used to fund the development of Titan.\n\nTo recoup the costs, OceanGate's sub, \"well-lit and comfortable,\" the company said, came with a price tag of $250,000 (\u00a3195,600) for an underwater trip.\n\nMr Rush's clients were uber-rich thrill seekers, willing to part with that sum for a once-in-a-lifetime adventure.\n\nLas Vegas businessman Jay Bloom had been messaging Mr Rush about joining a dive, before finally turning down a seat for himself and his son on the fatal excursion.\n\nHe said the chance to see the wreck up close would have been a \"bucket-list\" experience. It was about being able to say \"you did something very few people have the opportunity to do\", he said.\n\nDespite the large sums of money involved, OceanGate equipment sometimes had a home-made feel.\n\nThe former junior employee told the BBC he was surprised to find that Titan's electrical design included off-the-shelf development boards, as opposed to using a custom, in-house design like other engineering companies.\n\nDavid Pogue, a CBS News journalist who joined Mr Rush on a trip to the Titanic wreck in 2021, said the chief executive drove the Titan with a game controller and used \"rusty lead pipes from the construction industry as ballast\".\n\nYet Mr Rush assured Mr Pogue that only thing that really mattered was the vessel's hull, built from an unusual and largely untested material for a deep sea vessel: carbon fibre, with titanium end plates.\n\nMr Rush knew carbon fibre was used successfully in yachts and aviation, and believed it would allow for his submersible to made more cheaply than industry-standard steels ones.\n\n\"There's a rule you don't do that,\" said Mr Rush in 2021. \"Well, I did.\"\n\nThe tube shape of the Titan was also unusual. The hull of a deep-diving sub is usually spherical, which means it receives an equal amount of pressure at every point, but the Titan had a cylinder-shaped cabin. OceanGate gave it sensors to analyse the effects of changing pressure as it descended.\n\nThe glass viewport, from which passengers could see out, was only certified down to 1,300m, far short of the depths of the ocean floor where the Titantic wreck lay.\n\nRob McCallum, an explorer who acted as a consultant for OceanGate, became concerned when Mr Rush decided against getting official certification for the submersible.\n\nSubs can be certified or \"classed\" by marine organisations, like the American Bureau of Shipping or Lloyd's Register, meaning the vehicle must meet certain standards on things like stability, strength, safety and performance. But this process is not mandatory.\n\nIn emails to Mr Rush in March 2018, seen by BBC News, Mr McCallum said: \"You are wanting to use a prototype un-classed technology in a very hostile place. As much as I appreciate entrepreneurship and innovation, you are potentially putting an entire industry at risk.\n\n\"4,000m down in the mid-Atlantic is not the kind of place you can cut corners.\"\n\nMr Rush, apparently indignant, responded that he was \"tired of industry players who try to use a safety argument to stop innovation\".\n\nSafety was \"about culture, not paperwork\", he said. He talked of needing \"sensible design, extensive testing, and informed consent of the participants\", but said a piece of paper did not guarantee the safety of a sub.\n\nWhile he admitted deviating from some guidelines, such as \"overly conservative\" viewport limits, he argued the Titan's safety systems were \"way beyond\" anything else in use.\n\nHe wrote: \"I know that our engineering focused, innovative approach (as opposed to an existing standards compliance-focused design process) flies in the face of the submersible orthodoxy, but that is the nature of innovation.\"\n\nThe tense exchange ended after OceanGate's lawyers threatened legal action, Mr McCallum said.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: OceanGate boss Stockton Rush on his passion for the seas - and for taking risks\n\nBut Mr McCallum was not the only person linked to the company to speak out about safety.\n\nJust a few months earlier, former OceanGate employee David Lochridge raised concerns in an inspection report which identified \"numerous issues that posed serious safety concerns\", including how the hull had been tested.\n\nAlso in 2018, the Marine Technology Society sent a letter to OceanGate accusing it of making misleading claims about its design exceeding established industry safety standards, and warned that OceanGate's \"experimental\" approach could result in \"negative outcomes (from minor to catastrophic)\".\n\nIn a blog post in 2019, Mr Rush insisted that the majority of marine accidents were down to operator error. He said OceanGate took safety requirements very seriously, but that keeping an outside body informed on every modification before it was tested in a real-word setting was \"anathema to rapid innovation\".\n\nThe former employee told the BBC that while he had worked at OceanGate, he had felt confident in Mr Rush's commitment to safety.\n\n\"Rush was very level-headed, he knew what needed to be done,\" he said. \"He went on every sub dive, he was the pilot for every single one, and that's because he trusted the safety of the sub.\"\n\nMr Newman told the BBC the sub might not have been certified, but it was tested extensively. Mr Rush \"introduced new ideas and new pieces that are not conventional, and some people don't like that\", he said.\n\n\"The idea that this is something that's unique and Stockton did something wrong is disingenuous,\" he said.\n\nMr Rush himself told CBS reporter Mr Pogue last year that \"if you just want to be safe, don't get out of bed\".\n\n\"Don't get in your car. Don't do anything. At some point, you're going to take some risk, and it really is a risk-reward question. I think I can do this just as safely by breaking the rules,\" he said.\n\nThe question is why despite other successful dives, the sub's final trip ended in tragedy, Mr Newman said.\n\n\"Clearly, the pressure hull gave way, right? And the question is, why would that give way?\"\n\nGuillermo S\u00f6hnlein, a co-founder of OceanGate and Rush's former business partner, said he would not have taken a different approach himself.\n\n\"The human submersible community globally is very small, and we all know each other, and I think generally we all respect each other's opinions.\n\n\"The bottom line is that everyone's got different opinions on how subs should be designed,\" said Mr S\u00f6hnlein.\n\nAfter his son also raised fears about the sub, Jay Bloom declined Mr Rush's invitation.\n\n\"I am sure he really believed what he was saying,\" Mr Bloom said. \"But he was very wrong.\"", "Sometimes a gathering of the Liaison Committee can provide parliamentary fireworks - but today's session was relatively sedate.\n\nFor most of the 90 minutes, the prime minister faced gently probing questions and gave detailed if largely unsurprising answers.\n\nRishi Sunak denied his policy to tackle small boat crossings had stalled, insisted the government was committed to building enough houses and defended his approach to reducing inflation.

He said no-one was injured in the incident.\n\nAsked about his appetite for exploration, he said: \"My view is that these are all calculated risks and are well understood before we start.\"\n\nLast weekend, he said on Facebook that the mission was \"likely to be the first and only in 2023\" because of poor weather conditions in Newfoundland, Canada, where the missions set off from.\n\nLater, his stepson Brian Szasz said in a now-deleted post on Facebook that his stepfather \"has gone missing on (the) submarine\".\n\nFriend David Mearns, a marine scientist and expedition leader, described Mr Harding as a \"very charming guy\" who was attracted to extreme adventures.\n\nPatrick Woodhead, founder of British tour operator White Desert Antarctica, said Mr Harding was an \"incredible\" aviation explorer, and that his thoughts and prayers were with Mr Harding's wife, Linda, and his sons.\n\nTerry Virts, a retired Nasa astronaut, said his friend was the \"quintessential British explorer\" who loved adventure and exploring, but was not an adrenaline junkie.\n\n\"Some people watch Netflix, some people play golf, and Hamish goes to the bottom of the ocean, or into space, and he's set world records flying around the planet,\" he told BBC Radio 4 Today's programme.\n\nLucy Cosnett, Mr Harding's cousin and goddaughter, called for a full investigation into his death as she described him as a \"lovely caring person\".\n\n\"When I read they had heard banging noises I was feeling hopeful that maybe it was coming from the submersible.

Disqualify me for life.... I will keep going, I will not stop.\"\n\nAlthough India's opposition parties don't always agree on political issues, many of them have supported Mr Gandhi over his disqualification. On Friday, 14 parties approached the Supreme Court, alleging that the federal government was misusing investigative agencies to target BJP's opponents.\n\nCongress president Mallikarjun Kharge alleged that the action against Mr Gandhi was a consequence of his demand for a parliamentary investigation to probe allegations against the Adani Group.\n\nThe huge conglomerate was accused of decades of \"brazen\" stock manipulation and accounting fraud by US-based short-seller Hindenburg Research earlier this year. The Adani Group has denied allegations of financial fraud.\n\n\"My job as I see it is to defend the democratic nature of this country,\" Mr Gandhi said after his disqualification.\n\n\"That means defending the institutions of this country, that means defending the voice of the poor people of this country, that means telling the people of this country the truth about people like Mr Adani, who are basically exploiting the relationship they have with the prime minister,\" he said.\n\n\"I was disqualified because Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scared of my next speech on Adani... I can see it in his eyes.\"\n\nMr Gandhi's supporters say his disqualification is a sign that India's democratic system is weakening, and more protests against the government are planned in the coming days.\n\nHe will not be allowed to take part in national elections due next year, unless his sentence is suspended or he is acquitted in the case.\n\nThe ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), however, said the decision to disqualify Mr Gandhi was in accordance with parliamentary laws, and criticised his party for questioning the verdict.\n\nFederal Labour Minister Bhupender Yadav said Mr Gandhi had insulted members of the caste grouping known as Other Backward Classes (OBC) under which the name \"Modi\" falls.\n\n\"Insulting any surname is not freedom of speech,\" he said.\n\nBut some experts have questioned the severity of Mr Gandhi's sentence.\n\nJoyojeet Pal, an associate professor of information at the University of Michigan, said that it was \"highly unusual\" for a first-time offender like Mr Gandhi to be given the maximum possible punishment of two years' imprisonment.\n\n\"Both low-level politicians and parliamentarians in India are known to engage in extreme speech on social media and in their public meetings. A conviction of this scale, with the consequence of removing the primary challenger to Modi, is practically unheard of,\" Prof Pal added.", "Sleaze. It's a big word, and it gets lobbed around at Westminster rather a lot.\n\nIt tends to refer to alleged wrongdoing, often financial or moral.\n\nThe thing is, it can take in everything from an MP who ends up in jail - think the MPs' expenses scandal just for starters - to alleged procedural or administrative cock-ups that are soon forgotten.\n\nSo how big a deal is the investigation into the prime minister by the parliamentary commissioner for standards?\n\nOn the Richter scale of these things, it feels like a rather minor tremor. Think a few loose roof tiles rather than anything much more.\n\nThere are two things at the crux of this.\n\nThe first is what Rishi Sunak chose to say, and, crucially, not to say, in front of what is known as the Liaison Committee of MPs at the end of last month.\n\nHe was asked explicitly, by the Labour MP Catherine McKinnell, \"there is nothing as prime minister you wish to declare?\".\n\nAnd he did not at that point refer to a childcare company his wife Akshata Murty has shares in which looks likely to benefit from this spring's Budget.\n\n\"All of my disclosures are declared in the normal way,\" Mr Sunak replied.\n\nBut in announcing his investigation, the website of the standards commissioner, Daniel Greenberg, pointed to a particular rule in the code of conduct of MPs, stating that \"members must always be open and frank in declaring any relevant interest in any proceeding of the House or its Committees, and in any communications with ministers, members, public officials or public office holders\".\n\nThe implication being that the prime minister should have referred explicitly to his wife's shareholding in front of the committee.\n\nThe added twist here, a symptom of the chaos at Westminster in the last year or so, is the Register of Ministerial Interests, which has conventionally been updated around every six months, hasn't seen the light of day since last May.\n\nSo when the prime minister said to the Liaison Committee, as he did, that his \"disclosures are declared in the normal way\" they haven't actually been published.\n\nHe has said he has informed officials in the Cabinet Office, but whatever he told them, and they told him about whether it should be explicitly registered, has not been publicly declared.\n\nIncidentally, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer found himself in a run-in with the parliamentary commissioner for standards last summer.\n\nIt was Mr Greenberg's predecessor then, Kathryn Stone.\n\nShe found he had breached the MPs' Code of Conduct eight times, describing the breaches as \"minor and/or inadvertent\" over declarations that were late.\n\nSir Keir apologised. The row very quickly blew over.\n\nThe prime minister will hope his encounter with Mr Greenberg is also quickly forgotten about, although it will increase the scrutiny of Ms Murty's other business interests and the declarations relating to them.\n\nIt is a reminder for Downing Street of another two things: the inevitable stories, borne of intrigue and fascination, relating to the Sunaks' vast wealth, of which this is the latest.\n\nAnd that if you say on your first day in the job of prime minister, almost six months ago now, that your government will be defined by \"integrity, professionalism and accountability at every level\", you bet people will hold you to it.", "President Erdogan says Sweden has promised to hand over 73 people\n\nNato has formally launched the process to bring Sweden and Finland into its military alliance.

So who does Turkey want and could they ever be deported to Ankara?\n\nSweden and Finland applied to join the West's defensive alliance after Russia launched its war in Ukraine.

Watch: Handshakes as Turkey signs agreement to support Finland and Sweden joining Nato\n\nUnder a memorandum signed at a Nato summit last week, Finland and Sweden agreed to address Turkey's \"pending deportation or extradition requests of terror suspects expeditiously and thoroughly\", with \"bilateral legal frameworks to facilitate extradition\".\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Sweden had promised to extradite 73 \"terrorists\" and had already sent three or four of them. Pro-government Turkish daily Hurriyet published a list of 45 people, including 33 sought from Sweden and 12 from Finland.\n\nTurkey is particularly keen on the handover of individuals it considers linked to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), considered a terror group by the EU, US and UK. It is also after followers of exiled Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen. Gulenists are blamed by Turkey for a failed coup against President Erdogan in 2016.\n\nThe BBC has spoken to three of the people sought by Turkey.\n\nFor years, he was editor-in-chief of Today's Zaman, a major English-language daily in Turkey, before it was shut down in 2016. Now, he lives in exile in Stockholm.\n\nTurkish authorities accuse him of being part of the Gulen movement, or what they call the Fethullah Terrorist Organisation (Feto). It is known for its network of schools and is not considered a terror group in the EU, UK or US.\n\nMr Kenes said he became a target for his outspoken criticism of President Erdogan and faced accusations of plotting to topple the government: \"All the allegations are fabricated. I am an independent journalist with no affiliations with any organisation.\"\n\nHe was given a suspended jail term in 2015 for \"insulting the president\", in a tweet that said Mr Erdogan's late mother would be ashamed of him.\n\nInsulting President Erdogan remains a common charge today, with 17 journalists and cartoonists put on trial in the first three months of 2022, according to independent Turkish organisation Bianet.\n\nThe deal struck by the countries' leaders says Sweden and Finland will support Turkey in its fight against terrorism\n\nBulent Kenes believes he has become a bargaining chip between Mr Erdogan and Sweden in Nato negotiations.\n\nHe is not particularly afraid of being extradited, as that would be a \"betrayal of Sweden's own values\" of democracy and protecting dissidents. \"This is not a test for the Erdogan regime... this is a test for the Swedish authorities,\" he said.\n\nOthers on Turkey's list are far less prominent. Fatih, a Finnish Kurd, was part of a group of five young men who set fire to the door of the Turkish embassy in 2008.\n\nNow a 37-year-old business owner and entrepreneur, he told the BBC he regretted what he did: \"At that time, my life was messed up, I had many kinds of problems.\"\n\nHe was surprised to find his name on the list as he finished serving a 14-month suspended sentence long ago - and paid damages to the embassy. Finnish authorities granted him citizenship a few years ago and considered the embassy case closed, he said.\n\nOne person in the embassy was injured in the 2008 attack on the Turkish embassy in Helsinki\n\nTurkey accuses him of being a member of the militant PKK, which calls for greater Kurdish self-governance and is involved in an armed struggle with the Turkish state.\n\nFatih said he had no ties or ideological connections to the PKK, and believed he was targeted purely because of his Kurdish background.\n\nKurds make up 15-20% of Turkey's population but have faced persecution in Turkey for generations. The government in Ankara is trying to ban the pro-Kurdish HDP party, the third biggest in parliament.\n\nWhile Fatih did not believe he would be extradited as a Finnish citizen, he feared harassment in the local Turkish community or possible arrest abroad at Turkey's request. He said he was very sad that Finland was having to \"fight for him\".\n\nAysen Furhoff came to Sweden after serving five years of a life sentence in Turkey for trying to \"subvert the constitutional order\" when she was 17 and a member of the Turkish Communist Party. She said she was offered protection in Sweden after being tortured in jail.\n\nNow 45, she lives in Stockholm with her husband and daughter and works as a teacher, and insists she is no longer involved in Turkish politics.\n\nAysen Furhoff says she is disappointed with Sweden's decision to sign a deal with Mr Erdogan\n\n\"I left Turkey 20 years ago. If I get sent there, they will have no use for me. Everyone I know is either dead or in prison. That's why being on the list was surprising - who am I to them?\"\n\nMs Furhoff says she is also being prosecuted in Turkey for being a PKK member. She admits collaborating with them for three months some 25 years ago.\n\nWhile she no longer sympathises with the PKK, she denies they are a terror group and believes they should be part of discussions for a negotiated peace in Turkey.\n\nCiting Swedish law, she is not worried about extradition but finds it hard to believe she could be an important case for Ankara.\n\nLegal requirements in Sweden and Finland make it very hard for Turkey to extradite the kind of numbers it wants:\n\nAccording to Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter, of the 33 Swedish names listed in Turkish media, 19 have already been rejected for extradition by Stockholm's Supreme Court.\n\n\"We cannot go through earlier cases that have already been processed,\" said Chief Justice Anders Eka.\n\nFinland has extradited two people to Turkey out of more than a dozen requests over the past decade. The justice ministry says no new requests have been received and it has promised the Kurdish community there will be no change to the law.\n\nIf Turkey's demands are rejected, it could withdraw its support for the Nordic nations' accession to Nato, says Murat Yesiltas of pro-government think tank Seta.\n\nParliaments in all 30 Nato countries will need to approve Sweden and Finland as members and that includes Turkish lawmakers.

In two of those games they failed to register a shot on target, leading to calls from some supporters for Foster to go.\n\nFoster, who left his role as Steven Gerrard's assistant at Saudi Arabian side Al-Ettifaq to take over at Argyle, was unbeaten in his first five games in charge of the side as he led Argyle to a win over Sutton United in the FA Cup and league victories over Cardiff City and Swansea City.\n\nBut following an extra-time loss to Leeds United in an FA Cup fourth-round replay, a 2-0 win at Middlesbrough and two draws were the only positive results in the following 11 league games.\n\nImmediately after the Bristol City loss, Foster said he had had no discussions with the Argyle board about his future in the role, or any concerns that the club might seek a new head coach.\n\n\"Nobody's happy when you don't win a game of football - this is our lives and our livelihoods,\" Foster told BBC Radio Devon.\n\n\"We're fighting and that's the key thing. We're not a group who take things lightly, we're not a group that give in, we're not a group who look for excuses.\n\n\"We take responsibility and we'll try our best to go again.\"\n\nFoster's hand was not helped by a number of key loan players leaving soon after his arrival.\n\nFinn Azaz was recalled by Aston Villa and sold to Middlesbrough, while Luke Cundle joined Stoke after returning to Wolves.\n\nBut he mainly brought in inexperienced youngsters on loan to replace the players he lost, while he failed to get goals out of previously free-scoring Ryan Hardie and Morgan Whittaker over the past two months.\n\nFoster also cut an isolated figure at times. He only recently brought in a first-team coach in former Huddersfield coach Ireland - and relied heavily on the staff still at the club after Schumacher's departure.\n\nFoster's tenure is the shortest of any permanent Argyle boss - only Steve McCall's 15-game spell in long-term caretaker charge before Neil Warnock took over between January and March 1995 was shorter.\n\nPlymouth Argyle's decision to go with a man who had never been the number one with a men's senior side was seen as a bit of a gamble at the time.\n\nWith his success with England Under-20s and the accomplishments of other England youth coaches such as Steve Cooper and Rob Edwards, the club could be forgiven for thinking they were hiring someone who could offer similar success.\n\nBut after an initial good start, Argyle's form has faded badly. A lack of goals has been synonymous with a side that has lost its attacking impetus.\n\nFoster was not helped by losing players such as Azaz and Cundle in January, but replacements that he knew from his time with England Under-20s like Alfie Devine and Darko Gyabi have not had the same impact.\n\nHaving seemed like shoo-ins to stay in the Championship just two months ago, Argyle must now act quickly to find a replacement that can keep them in the division less than a year after winning League One with a club record 101 points.", "The grizzly population has increased around Yellowstone\n\nA woman has been found dead on a trail near Yellowstone National Park after likely coming into contact with a grizzly bear, park officials have said.\n\nTracks from a grizzly were discovered close to the woman's body on Saturday near the town of West Yellowstone in Montana state, they said.\n\nThe woman was found after \"an apparent bear encounter,\" they added, though no cause of death has been confirmed.\n\nDays before the woman was found on Saturday, Montana's fish, wildlife and parks department warned visitors and staff of the increased danger from grizzlies and urged campers and hikers to carry bear spray and to secure food and rubbish.\n\nRangers issued an emergency closure of the area where the woman was found, which is popular with hikers.\n\nYellowstone has two main bear species - the grizzly and the black bear.

The car then crashes to a stop.\n\nThe teenager, named as Nahel, died of bullet wounds in the chest despite help from emergency services.\n\nThe officer accused of shooting him has been detained on homicide charges.\n\nThe shooting triggered a series of protests on Tuesday night in Nanterre, the area just west of Paris where the teenager was killed. Some 31 people were arrested following the disorder.\n\nNahel is the second person this year in France to have been killed in a police shooting during a traffic stop. Last year, a record 13 people died in this way.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nAccording to French media, police initially suggested the teen drove his car towards them with the intention of hurting them.\n\nBut footage posted online and verified by the AFP news agency tells a different story.\n\nIt shows two officers at the vehicle. One points his weapon at the driver through the window and appears to fire at point-blank range as he tries to drive off.\n\nThe agency also reports that a person in the video can be heard saying \"you're going to be shot in the head\" - but it is unclear who says it.\n\nTwo others were in the car at the time of the shooting - one fled while another, also a minor, was arrested and held by police.\n\nThe incident sparked anger and disorder overnight, with cars and rubbish bins set alight and bus shelters destroyed. Fireworks were also set off near the police station. Riot police used tear gas to break up protesters, some of whom created barricades throughout the night.\n\nSeveral incidents of unrest were also recorded in the towns of Asni\u00e8res, Colombes, Suresnes, Aubervilliers, Clichy-sous-Bois and Mantes-la-Jolie.\n\nThe Nanterre shooting is set to be one of those symbolic moments that define the troubled relations between police and disaffected populations in the suburban cit\u00e9s, or estates.\n\nThe government can see this as well as anyone, which is why they will be treading very carefully over the next days. G\u00e9rald Darmanin, interior minister, set the tone when he said that the police action was - from the look of it - unacceptable.\n\nThe danger is that the rioting of Tuesday extends over the coming nights.

But on 13 occasions last year occupants of cars in such situations were shot dead by French police. That strongly suggests something is wrong.\n\nAuthorities have opened two separate investigations following the teen's death - one into a possible killing by a public official, and another into the driver's failure to stop his vehicle and the alleged attempt to kill a police officer.\n\nParis police chief Laurent Nu\u00f1ez told French television station BFMTV that the policeman's actions \"raises questions\", though he suggested the officer may have felt threatened.\n\nThe 17-year-old's family lawyer Yassine Bouzrou insisted that was an illegitimate defence, telling the same channel the video \"clearly showed a policeman killing a young man in cold blood\".\n\nHe added that the family had filed a complaint against police for \"lying\" - after initially claiming the car had tried to run down the officers.\n\nAnother lawyer representing the victim's family, Jennifer Cambla, told local media that nothing could justify what had happened, and described the death as an \"execution\".\n\nIn a video posted on TikTok, Nahel's mother Mounia urged people to join her on a march for her son.\n\n\"Come all, I beg you\", she said. \"We will all be there.\"\n\n\"I'm hurting for my France.

A major road lined with anti-tank ditches. Satellite analysis by BBC Verify has uncovered some of the extensive defences built by Russia as it prepares for a major Ukrainian counter-attack.\n\nAfter months of stalemate, the expected assault is likely to be a crucial test for Ukraine as it seeks to prove it can achieve significant battlefield gains with the weapons it has received from the West.\n\nBy examining hundreds of satellite images, the BBC has identified some key points in the significant build-up of trenches and other fortifications in southern Ukraine since October.\n\nThese four locations offer an insight into what Russia expects from the counter-offensive, and what defences Ukrainian forces might encounter.\n\nSeized by Russia in 2014, Crimea was formerly known for its beach resorts.\n\nNow, instead of sun loungers and parasols, the coastline stretching for 15 miles (25km) is littered with defence structures installed by Russian troops.\n\nThe image below shows the only open sandy beach on the west coast without natural defences such as cliffs or hills.\n\nFirstly, there are \"dragon's teeth\" along the shore: pyramid-shaped blocks of concrete, designed to block the path of tanks and other military vehicles.\n\nBehind them is a line of trenches, providing cover from incoming attacks. Several bunkers can also be spotted along the trenches.\n\nStacks of wood, digging machines and stores of dragon's teeth along the coast suggest building work was still in progress when the image was taken in March.\n\nSome military experts suggest the defences are likely to be a precaution, rather than a sign that Russia expects to defend a seaborne assault, since Ukraine has little naval capacity.\n\nIntelligence analyst Layla Guest says: \"The fortifications are likely in place to deter any bold Ukrainian operation to attack Crimea via the sea rather than on land.\"\n\nThe beach fortification is just one example of a vast network of trenches, as shown by the black dots in the map below, based on work by open-source analyst Brady Africk.\n\nBBC Verify has been able to identify other key fortification sites by pinpointing individual trench locations from videos on social media.\n\nOnce an exact location was discovered it was then possible to trace an entire trench network using satellite images.\n\nThe small city of Tokmak lies on a key route in the south-east of the country that Ukrainian forces may want to use to cut off Crimea from other Russian-held territories.\n\nThere have been reports that Ukrainian civilians have been moved out in order to turn the city into a military fortress. This would provide soldiers with access to supplies and a base to retreat to.\n\nThe satellite image above shows that a network of trenches in two lines has been dug north of Tokmak - the direction Ukraine would have to attack from.\n\nBehind these trenches is a further ring of fortifications around the city, with three layers of defences that can be seen distinctly in this close-up satellite image.\n\nThe top of the satellite image shows an anti-tank ditch. These are usually at least 2.5m deep and designed to trap any enemy tanks that attempt to cross.\n\nBehind the ditch are several rows of dragon's teeth and another trench network.\n\nBut Ukrainian forces are likely to face further traps.\n\nIt's highly likely that mines have also been hidden between Tokmak's three defence lines, says Mark Cancian from the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n\"Minefields are a standard part of every defence, and the Russians have used them extensively throughout the war.\n\n\"Here they will be large and better concealed, slowing down Ukrainian attacks so that other combat elements, like artillery and infantry, can strike the attacking forces.\"\n\nBBC Verify has also discovered three other towns near Tokmak have been similarly fortified.\n\nA line of anti-tank ditches and trenches now runs alongside a 22-mile (35km) stretch of the E105 main highway, west of Tokmak.\n\nThe E105 is strategically important, connecting Russian-held Melitopol in the south with the northern city of Kharkiv, held by Ukraine. The road also runs through the Zaporizhzhia region, which could be the target of a Ukrainian counter-offensive.\n\nThe side that controls the E105 can easily move troops around the region.\n\nIf Ukrainian forces attempt to use this road, Russia will likely target it with heavy artillery from behind their defences. Russia's position is also in range of another nearby road - the T401 - which could also be targeted.\n\n\"The Russians are worried about the recently built Ukrainian armour units. If these units can get on a main highway, they can move very quickly,\" says Mr Cancian.\n\n\"The Russian defences aim to push them off the roads and therefore slow them down.\"\n\nThe port of Mariupol has a strategic position between the Russian-occupied territories in the east and Crimea in the south. It also became a symbol of resistance to invasion when a hard-core of fighters held out for months as the city was besieged.\n\nGiven Russia expects Ukraine to try to retake it, BBC Verify decided to look at the territory surrounding the city - leading to the discovery of a collection of circular trenches.\n\nLocated near the small village of Rivnopil about 34 miles (55km) north of Mariupol, each circular trench has a mound of soil in the middle, possibly either to protect artillery or to keep guns stable.\n\nMeanwhile, the circular trenches allow soldiers to take cover and to move the artillery so it can aim in any direction.\n\nIt shows that Russia is preparing to defend areas of open ground (without natural protection from hills and rivers) alongside their wider trench network.\n\nBut some analysts note that Ukrainian forces can use similar satellite images and drone surveillance to identify and bypass many of these defences.\n\nAlexander Lord from strategic advisory firm Sibylline Ltd says: \"The Russians will therefore likely attempt to funnel Ukrainian forces down certain routes which are heavily mined and pre-targeted by Russian artillery.\"\n\nSatellite images show obvious defences - but that might all be part of Russia's plan.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nRead more about BBC Verify: Explaining the 'how' - the launch of BBC Verify", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Only two are finished and open.\n\nMinisters aimed to have six ready for 2025 - but none of this group has full planning permission or funding yet.\n\nThe government insists it remains committed to meeting the targets.\n\n\"We are developing a new national approach to constructing hospitals so they can be built more rapidly, ensure value for money, and we continue to work closely with all trusts on their plans,\" an official said.\n\nHealth leaders say they need urgent clarity.\n\nThe BBC looked at the issue last year and since then there has been little progress.\n\nWhen the pledge was announced, in 2019, there was some controversy about exactly what counts as a \"new hospital\".\n\nNHS guidance says it can range from an entirely new building on a new site to a major refurbishment or alteration.\n\nBy October 2020, the commitment was confirmed, with an initial budget of \u00a33.7bn.\n\nOf the 40 hospitals on the list, eight were projects already planned.\n\nBBC News contacted them all, asking for a progress report:\n\nInvestment seems to be a factor:\n\nOne of the six due to be completed in 2025 is Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust, near London.\n\nSome parts of St Helier's site look more like a derelict building than a functioning NHS hospital.\n\nA makeshift wooden roof at the back is held down with sandbags.\n\nOne of the three intensive-care units has a problem with ventilation, so it can be used only as a storeroom.\n\nStaff are using a bucket to catch the drips from the leak in the ceiling\n\nIn another, staff are working around a leak.\n\nIn winter, it is not unusual for entire corridors to flood.\n\nWhen we met Chief Medical Officer Ruth Charlton outside a condemned ward, she told us: \"It's not safe to enter - the foundations are crumbling and windows are falling out.\"\n\nShe cannot see a new build happening by 2025. Her \"optimistic\" estimate is 2027. Ms Charlton would not be drawn on a realistic guess but was blunt about how sad and frustrated she felt.\n\n\"I'm frustrated on behalf of our patients, their families or staff that they can't receive healthcare in the sort of facility that I would want my family to receive healthcare in,\" she told us.\n\nAs we talk, we can hear the sound of a maintenance crew drilling.\n\nThe trust says its backlog maintenance - to bring buildings and equipment up to standard - will cost \u00a3130m.\n\nAcross the NHS in England, backlog-maintenance costs have more than doubled, from \u00a34.7bn in 2011-12 to \u00a310.2bn in 2021-22.\n\nIn other words, it has become twice as expensive just to keep the doors open.\n\nHealth think tank the Nuffield Trust chief executive Nigel Edwards says the government started with a \"big and slightly vague promise - and it was never clear there was enough money available to do anything like the scale of construction that they wanted to\". And ministers hitting their 2030 target is \"extremely unlikely\".\n\n\"They've underestimated how long it takes to change the way they design, build, and plan hospitals,\" he says.\n\n\"It's a great ambition - but I think a bit of realism is now starting to sink in.\"\n\nIn 2019, Boris Johnson assured voters he could build the 40 new hospitals but only \"because we're running a strong economy\".\n\nThe government has never explicitly allocated a budget for this project - but it has undoubtedly become more expensive.\n\nInflation means prices have gone up sharply, especially in construction.\n\nInstitute for Financial Studies senior research economist Ben Zaranko says: \"Either the government sticks to that pledge and accepts it will need to spend more on hospital building or it decides it scales back the number and scope of hospitals.\"\n\nA Department of Health and Social Care official said: \"We remain committed to delivering all 40 new hospitals by 2030 as part of the biggest hospital-building programme in a generation.\"\n\nThe logic here is the New Hospital Programme is developing a new national approach to building these hospitals across England - and a standard approach should mean more a rapid process.\n\nBut there is another - potentially dangerous - complication. Several hospitals across England are at risk of collapse, with roofs propped up with scaffolding and posts, because they were built using reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (RAAC) - a lightweight concrete with bubbles inside like \"a chocolate Aero bar\".\n\nThe NHS has identified 34 NHS buildings in England containing RAAC planks - and it is believed about five need to be dealt with urgently.\n\nBut only a small number of the hospitals with planned new builds are thought to be affected by RAAC, so it would make sense to expect new RAAC hospitals to be added to the list soon.\n\nA Department of Health and Social Care official said: \"We remain committed to delivering all 40 new hospitals by 2030 as part of the biggest hospital-building programme in a generation.\"\n\n\"We are developing a new national approach to constructing hospitals so they can be built more rapidly, ensure value for money, and we continue to work closely with all trusts on their plans.\"\n\nSir Julian Hartley, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents trusts, wants clarity, ideally in the next few weeks.\n\n\"We are at a pivotal moment, a key point, where we cannot leave for much longer the scale of deterioration,\" he says.\n\n'We need to know that if we delay too much longer, the scale of the problems in other hospitals and facilities will get to a critical level.\"\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he added there was an \"absolutely dire need for decisions to be made about making progress... and tackling in the longer term the ageing infrastructure\" of hospitals.", "Prosecuting Donald Trump would be a politically motivated move by his opponents, senior Republicans say.\n\nOn Saturday, the former US president said his arrest could happen next week, based on media reports.\n\nBut Democrats have said no-one is above the law and accused Mr Trump of recklessly stoking political divisions.\n\nThe case focuses on alleged hush money paid on Mr Trump's behalf by his lawyer to porn star Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe 76-year-old is also the subject of several other separate inquiries, although he has not yet been charged in any and denies wrongdoing.\n\nMr Trump has pledged to continue his campaign to become the Republican nominee in the 2024 presidential election, even if he is indicted.\n\nIt is not yet known if he is going to be criminally charged or even, beyond the most basic details, what any indictment might contain.\n\nFormer US vice-president Mike Pence and the most senior Republican in the US Congress, Kevin McCarthy, have both spoken out against any criminal prosecution.\n\nSpeaking to US network ABC News, Mr Pence said Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg, who is a Democrat, was carrying out a \"politically charged prosecution\" against Mr Trump.\n\n\"I'm taken aback at the idea of indicting a former president of the United States, at a time when there's a crime wave in New York City,\" Mr Pence said.\n\n\"The fact that the Manhattan DA [district attorney] thinks that indicting President Trump is his top priority, I think is, just tells you everything you need to know about the radical left in this country,\" he told the broadcaster.\n\nIn his statement on Saturday Mr Trump called for mass protests from supporters and accused Mr Bragg's office of \"illegal leaks\" to journalists.\n\nAsked about the call for protests, Mr Pence said that US citizens have a \"constitutional right to peaceably assemble\" - but also said any action must take place \"peacefully and in a lawful manner\".\n\nSpeaker of the US House of Representatives Kevin McCarthy called the investigation \"an outrageous abuse of power by a radical DA\".\n\nIn a tweet, he also promised to investigate whether federal money was being used to interfere in elections \"with politically motivated prosecutions\".\n\nDemocrats accused Mr Trump of stirring up political divisions with his claims.\n\nSpeaking to ABC News, Democratic Senator Elizbeth Warren said \"no-one is above the law\" even if they happen to have been president and any investigation must be \"allowed to go forward appropriately\".\n\n\"There's no reason to protest this. This is the law operating as it should without fear or favour for anyone,\" she said.\n\nMr McCarthy's predecessor as House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, echoed Ms Warren's sentiments - adding that Mr Trump's remarks were \"reckless\" and designed to \"keep himself in the news and to foment unrest among his supporters\".\n\n\"He cannot hide from his violations of the law, disrespect for our elections and incitements to violence. Rightfully, our legal system will decide how to hold him accountable,\" she wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe Stormy Daniels case centres on how Mr Trump reimbursed his lawyer Michael Cohen after he paid Ms Daniels $130,000 before the 2016 US election.\n\nThe record for the payment reimbursing Mr Cohen says it was for \"legal fees\".

For months, they have championed his actions and attacked his opponents in the Ministry of Defence - particularly his sworn enemy, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu.\n\nBut when the Wagner mutiny was developing, their reaction was surprisingly muted.\n\nTwo of the largest groups, Grey Zone and Reverse Side of the Medal - with almost 900,000 followers between them - did not rush to endorse his actions, instead aiming for the reasonably neutral middle ground of blaming antagonism by Mr Shoigu and his loyalists for the bloodshed.\n\nFighters of Wagner group stand guard outside the headquarters of the Southern Military District in the city of Rostov-on-Don, Russia\n\nWagner PMC Briefs is a channel Prigozhin has confirmed as an official page of Wagner and is run by one of his troops.

Never messed with anybody. Always had a smile on his face.\"\n\nHis sports coach at the local high school, Roger McDonald, described him as an outstanding young man.\n\n\"Everybody loved Phil. He always had a smile on his face. He always spoke to everyone. He was the ideal kid that you want to coach. He wasn't just a great athlete. He was a great kid,\" he told the paper.\n\nOne of his friends who played with him on the high school football team, where Phil was the wide receiver, told the BBC: \"Phil to me was an amazing friend. God's got an angel.\"\n\nRelatives and friends of Ms Smith said she was a once-promising 17-year-old athlete who was also about to graduate from the town's high school.\n\nBen Hayes, senior pastor at the First Baptist Church in Dadeville and also chaplain at the school football team, knew many of the students at the party.\n\nHe told the BBC he received a phone call at the weekend telling him two students had been killed and several injured, and went to the local hospital. When he arrived, there were about 250 people in the car park waiting for news.\n\nHe says Dadeville - which has just over 3,000 residents - is a very close-knit community so \"this tragedy affects us very deeply\".\n\nMembers of the local community attend a vigil in Dadeville the day after the tragedy\n\nThere were about 50 people at the party, he said, when \"someone from outside the community\" came in and began shooting. He urged the perpetrator to turn himself in as his community needed closure.\n\nJimmy Frank Goodman Sr, the mayor of Dadeville, told the BBC he was in his bed asleep when he was notified about the shooting. When he got to the hospital, it was \"like I was in a dream\", he said.\n\nDadeville Mayor Jimmy Frank Goodman Sr said the scene at a hospital after the shooting was \"chaos\"\n\n\"It was chaos over there,\" he said. \"There were people crying, bodies going into the emergency room and bloody clothes on the ground.\"\n\nHe said the scene was worse than what he witnessed during his time serving in Vietnam.\n\n\"I was in the Marine Corps and seen things and had to do things that seem unbearable. But compared to this, Vietnam was a cakewalk,\" he said.\n\nHe said he did not have any information on the suspect and had only heard \"hearsay\".\n\nOn Monday, a spokesperson for the local Lake Martin Community Hospital said the facility had treated 15 teenagers, all of whom had sustained gunshot wounds.\n\nThey added that six of the injured had been treated and released. Nine were transferred to other facilities - five of whom remained in a critical condition.\n\nA vigil was held in the aftermath of the shooting and was attended by hundreds of community members, including Taniya Cox, who was one of the people injured in the shooting.\n\nMs Cox attended the vigil in a hospital gown with her right arm in a cast, according to the Montgomery Advertiser. She said she was shot twice in her arm at the party on Saturday.\n\n\"The mother [of the birthday girl] said whoever had guns had to get out and they didn't get out and five minutes later the shooting started,\" Ms Cox said.\n\nThe police have said nothing about how the shooting was brought to an end or about the police investigation but have urged the public to come forward with information.\n\nCasey Davis, a deputy superintendent at the local board of education, told the BBC that clergy and grief counsellors would be available to the community. Asked about the lack of information from police so far, Mr Davis replied: \"Let investigations go on.\"\n\nOther residents who spoke to the BBC described the mood in Dadeville as sombre and said community members were coming together to support each other in the aftermath of the shooting.\n\nThis attack takes the US to a grim milestone of more than 160 mass shootings so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which defines such events as ones in which four or more people are shot.\n\nPresident Joe Biden renewed his calls for tougher gun laws after the incident.\n\nHe condemned the killing as \"outrageous and unacceptable\", adding Americans wanted legislators to act to tackle mass shootings, but that Republicans were instead eroding gun safety laws.\n\nAlabama is a state known for protecting the right of citizens to own guns.\n\nWith reporting from Jessica Parker and Mike Wendling in Dadeville", "British soldiers prepare for operations around the world at the Kenya training unit\n\nKenyan MPs have voted to amend a defence agreement with Britain after allegations that troops training there committed serious crimes.\n\nIt means UK soldiers could be tried for murder, amongst other grave offences, committed against Kenyans in Kenya.\n\nIt comes after a lack of progress in getting justice for the 2012 murder of a young woman.\n\nAgnes Wanjiru went missing after she was seen walking out of a Kenyan bar with British soldiers.\n\nThe 21-year-old's body was later found in a septic tank at a hotel nearly three months later.

The Defence Serious Crime Command and Unit are proactively engaged with the Kenyan Police Service in support of their investigation where appropriate.\"\n\nIt also added it would not comment further in order to \"protect the integrity\" of the investigation.\n\nHowever, the amendment voted through on Wednesday does not apply retrospectively, meaning that it would not materially change how the Wanjiru case is handled.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with BBC's Focus on Africa Radio, the chair of the Kenyan parliament's Defence Committee, Nelson Koech, said he hoped the change would stop a case like Agnes' happening again.\n\nThis will ensure that if that ever happens again \"we have a faster local mechanism... to bring the culprits to book,\" Mr Koech said.\n\nThe defence agreement was initially proposed in 2021 under former President Uhuru Kenyatta, but its parliamentary ratification was delayed due to a presidential election and local objections over the agreement.\n\nThe amended deal will now go to the Kenyan Ministry of Defence for further negotiation with their British counterparts.\n\nNotably, the ministry cannot simply ignore the amendment if it does not wish to implement it.

The difference between the haves and the have nots is widening.\"\n\nDespite the change in mood, chief financial officers are still feeling risk averse with many saying their priorities were cutting costs and building up cash reserves. That will be a disappointment to the government who is keen for businesses to invest now to spur future economic growth.\n\nOne exception to that is investment in artificial intelligence. Deloitte found that an overwhelming majority of chief financial officers expect to see significant growth in spending on AI over the next five years but were divided on whether that would lead to an increase or decrease in the number of employees.\n\nThe UK economy has been struggling recently due to high gas prices, rising interest rates and a sluggish trade performance. Business investment has also been weak.\n\nLast week, the International Monetary Fund said Britain would be one of the worst performing major economies in the world this year, shrinking by 0.3%.\n\nHowever, this prediction is slightly better than its previous expectation of a 0.6% contraction, made in January. And a separate forecast published by the EY Item Club on Monday finds the UK is now expected to grow by 0.2% this year - up from a previously forecast contraction of 0.7%.\n\nHywel Ball, EY's UK chair, said the economy \"seems to be turning a corner, albeit very slowly\" but added that the challenges \"haven't gone away overnight\".\n\n\"Inflation is still in double-digits and energy prices remain historically high... However, perceptions matter and the fact the economy has been able to outperform expectations could help stir a revival in business and consumer confidence.\"", "Energy prices could spike this winter forcing governments to step in and subsidise bills again, the head of the International Energy Agency has said.\n\nIf the Chinese economy strengthens quickly and there is a harsh winter, gas prices could rise, putting pressure on consumers, Fatih Birol said.\n\nHe added that governments should push for energy-saving and boost renewables.\n\nHowever, a UK government spokesperson said annual energy bills are set to fall by an average \u00a3430 this month.\n\nGas prices soared after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, driving up energy bills around the world.\n\nA number of governments then stepped in with support for households, including in the UK, to try to soften the blow to consumers.\n\nThe IEA is an agency that works with governments and industry to provide data, analysis and recommend policies.\n\nMr Birol told the BBC's Today programme that many European governments made \"strategic mistakes\", including an over-reliance on Russia for energy, and that foreign policy had been \"blindfolded\" by short-term commercial decisions.\n\nHe said this winter \"we cannot rule out\" another spike in gas prices.\n\n\"In a scenario where the Chinese economy is very strong, buys a lot of energy from the markets, and we have a harsh winter, we may see strong upward pressure under natural gas prices, which in turn will put an extra burden on consumers,\" he said.\n\nThe Chinese economy had been bouncing back after Covid restrictions were lifted, but recently its economy has been slowing down.\n\nRatings agency S&P Global this week cut its forecast for Chinese growth, saying \"the risk is that its recovery loses more steam amid weak confidence among consumers and in the housing market\".\n\nInvestment banks including Goldman Sachs have also been cutting forecasts for Chinese growth.\n\nNevertheless, Mr Birol said governments including the UK should \"continue to push measures to save energy, especially as we enter the winter\".\n\nThey should also push renewable technologies so they \"see the light of day as soon as possible\" and cut the time it takes for them to get permits, and look for \"alternative energy options\", he said.\n\nHe said he \"wouldn't rule out blackouts\" this winter as \"part of the game\".\n\n\"We do not know yet how strongly the Chinese economy will rebound,\" he said.\n\nNational Grid said last winter that short power cuts were a possibility - in the end, this was not necessary.\n\nA UK government spokesperson said: \"We spent billions to protect families when prices rose over winter covering nearly half a typical household's energy bill, with them set to fall by around \u00a3430 on average from this month.\"\n\nDomestic gas and electricity bills in the UK fell at the weekend after a change to the energy price cap came into force, and a further, smaller fall is expected this winter.\n\nHowever, with the annual energy bill of a typical household set to be about \u00a32,000, costs are still much higher than the pre-pandemic norm.\n\nLast week the head of Centrica, which owns British Gas, warned energy bills were likely to stay high for the foreseeable future.\n\nRussia's war in Ukraine led to a \"gold rush\" of new fossil fuel exploration, and the UK defied climate warnings by issuing a new licensing round for North Sea oil and gas.\n\nMore than 100 applications have been submitted to drill for new oil and gas in the North Sea.\n\nThis was at odds with international climate scientists who say fossil fuel projects should be closed down, not expanded.\n\nThey say there can be no new projects if there is to be a chance of keeping global temperature rises under 1.5C.\n\nMr Birol said \"if the world is serious\" about the \"climate cause\" then \"we have to reduce the use of oil and gas significantly in the next years to come\".\n\nIf we can reduce consumption, existing oil and gas fields will be enough to meet declining demand, he added.\n\nHe said he has discussions with the chief executives of UK oil companies.\n\nMr Birol said he has \"no problem\" with oil firms making profits, but if they say: \"I am going to increase my production by four million barrels per day, and my company's strategy is in line with the Paris Climate Agreement - it doesn't work, there is a problem here.\"\n\nThe Rosebank field in the North Sea, which has the potential to produce 500 million barrels of oil, could be approved by the government within weeks.\n\nThe UK government said it was \"committed to reaching net zero by 2050 and have already come a long way to meet that target, cutting emissions faster than any other G7 country while keeping the economy growing and with low-carbon sources like renewables and nuclear providing half of the UK's electricity generation\".\n\nBut a spokesperson added \"the transition to cleaner energy cannot happen overnight and we will continue to need oil and gas over the coming decades, as recognised by the independent Climate Change Committee\".\n\nEmma Pinchbeck, the chief executive of Energy UK, which represents British energy companies, told the BBC's Today programme that the long-term solution to high bills \"is to invest in renewables and energy efficiency to make sure that we're not reliant on volatile international gas\".\n\n\"We expect that investment in more infrastructure in renewables and energy efficiency and alternative technologies to deliver cheaper bills in the long run... and that's why it's so important that we move quickly, particularly with increased international competition for these technologies.\"\n\nHere are some energy saving ideas from environmental scientist Angela Terry, who set up One Home, a social enterprise that shares green, money-saving tips:\n\nAre you struggling to pay your energy bills?

She described her situation as \"life-wrecking\".\n\nShe said she had returned to the UK from abroad to help care for her sick mother and their landlord had known about her mother's illness, but had begun eviction proceedings without warning or consulting them.\n\nThe family are on a waiting list for social housing but have only moved up a few places since November because of demand, she said.\n\n\"You feel powerless,\" she said.\n\n\"It's a completely life-wrecking experience. You can't make plans, you're constantly looking for a place to live and to learn the law and trying to make sure they're treating you legally.\"\n\nAverage monthly rents had risen in their area from \u00a3850 to more than \u00a31,200 since they had been looking for a new home, she said, and she and her siblings would therefore have to move \"really far away from our family and our support network if we did get a private rented house\".\n\n\"It's leaving us completely stuck,\" she said.\n\n\"There needs to be something in place for landlords to give a good reason why they are going to evict people, because with the rental market as it is, people can't just get somewhere to move into.\"\n\nThe government says a Renters Reform Bill will be brought forward in this Parliament\n\nShe said they had struggled to find support as many organisations were overwhelmed with people in a similar situation.\n\n\"There's no support, there's no safety net, everything is lined up in favour of landlords and you just have to accept it.\n\n\"But that's an impossible thing to do when there's nowhere to go and when the most basic thing that we need, which is a roof over our heads, becomes something that's unattainable,\" she added.\n\nIn a statement, the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said: \"We will bring forward a Renters Reform Bill in this Parliament, abolishing no-fault evictions so that all tenants have greater security in their homes and are empowered to challenge poor conditions and unreasonable rent rises.\n\n\"We are also introducing a Decent Homes Standard for the private rented sector for the first time ever, which will make sure privately rented homes are safe and decent.\"\n\nFamilies were also receiving \"significant support\" over this year and next, worth on average \u00a33,500 per household, as well as uprated benefits and a 10% rise in the state pension in April, the statement added.\n\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

But it does not solve all the problems which the protocol raises.\n\n\"The benefits to business include easier movement of goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland through the green lane.\n\n\"For some businesses, however, processes will be more burdensome under the Windsor Framework than under the protocol as it operates now.\n\n\"And where there is uncertainty, the red lane, with its more complex procedures, may have to be used.\"\n\nThe report says the framework brings significant improvements in areas such as medicines, pet travel and retail goods.\n\nBut one of the major issues raised by the inquiry is the treatment of \"groupage\" freight and mixed loads.\n\nGroupage is when goods dispatched by several different companies are grouped together into the same lorry load.\n\nThe concern is that if just one pallet contains goods which are going on to the Republic of Ireland then the entire load will need to be processed through the red lane which will entail bureaucracy and cost.\n\nSarah Hards, sales director at AM Logistics, told the inquiry that groupage was forgotten about in the original NI Protocol \"and really has not been remembered for this one\".\n\nThe committee has asked the government to clarify how the framework's provisions will impact upon groupage and the movement of mixed loads, and what steps are being taken to address the concerns of affected businesses.\n\nThe Windsor Framework was announced by Rishi Sunak and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen\n\nThe inquiry also heard that regulatory divergence between GB and the EU, and therefore between GB and Northern Ireland, remains \"number one concern\" for businesses.\n\nRegulatory divergence refers to the process by which new laws in either the EU or GB will, over time, lead to growing differences in the rules businesses face in each of those jurisdictions.\n\nThe committee said there was \"an underlying fear\" that Northern Ireland would find itself in a \"no-man's land\" between Great Britain and the EU, placing the competitiveness of Northern Ireland firms and their complex supply chains in jeopardy.\n\nIt welcomed the establishment of bodies to monitor such divergence but says it remains to be seen how effective these will be in practice.\n\nThe committee also reiterated a call for the UK government to create and maintain an up-to-date record of regulatory divergence and its impact on Northern Ireland.\n\nIn response to the report, a government spokesperson said the Windsor Framework \"is the best deal for Northern Ireland\", restoring the smooth flow of goods with Britain and protecting NI's place in the union.\n\n\"It cuts paperwork and checks compared to the old protocol, lifts the bans on products like seed potatoes and provides a durable, sustainable basis for the future,\" the spokesperson added.\n\n\"The committee's report underlines the importance of restoring the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly - it sets out at length how restored institutions would give Northern Ireland a greater say over the new arrangements.\"\n\nCivil servants have been running Northern Ireland departments since the Stormont executive collapsed 16 months ago, when the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) withdrew as part of its boycott of the post-Brexit trading arrangements.\n\nIn June, the DUP submitted a paper to the UK government with proposals on how to address key issues with the Windsor Framework.\n\nThe DUP's Lord Dodds, who sits on the committee, told BBC News NI the report \"vindicates\" his party's stance.\n\n\"The seven tests that we have set are iterations of what previous prime ministers have set out as the bare minimum which is acceptable, so we are repeating their words,\" he said.\n\nLord Dodds added the report \"says the Windsor Framework is more burdensome and onerous than the current position that we operate with the easements and grace periods\".\n\nGlyn Roberts, of business representative organisation Retail NI, said the report \"sets out a fair estimation of the challenges which will be faced by the local business community with the implementation of the Windsor Accord\".\n\nHe said the report \"rightly highlights issues around labelling requirements that impacts on our members\".\n\n\"Retail NI is disappointed at the lack of effective engagement on the labelling issue with only a few months to go before the new system is introduced,\" Mr Roberts said.\n\nThe delivery of the framework and the resetting of EU/ UK relations has been perhaps the most tangible outcome of Rishi Sunak's premiership.\n\nSo it was no surprise that he came to Northern Ireland to give it the hard sell, saying it would make Northern Ireland \"the world's most exciting economic zone\".\n\nThe Lords' report is a somewhat more sober analysis, pointing out that issues remain.\n\nBut while UK policy continues to be a hard Brexit and a completely soft Irish border then some trade frictions on GB-NI trade will be inevitable.", "Michael Allen has been named as the man who died at the scene\n\nTributes have been paid to a man stabbed to death near a nightclub on Sunday whom police have named as Michael Allen, 32.\n\nMr Allen was confirmed dead at the scene close to the Eclipse venue on Castle Canyke Road in Bodmin, Cornwall, following reports of a street brawl.\n\nSeven men and women with suspected stab wounds were taken to hospital.\n\nPolice have been granted by magistrates more time to question a man, 24, in connection with their murder inquiry.\n\nPolice investigations are continuing in the area\n\nThe family of Mr Allen, from Liskeard, said he was a \"much-loved son, brother, grandson, and uncle who loved his dogs\".\n\nThe family wished to \"respectfully request privacy at this time\", their statement added.\n\nThe suspect, also from Bodmin, has been arrested on suspicion of murder, attempted murder and causing grievous bodily harm with intent.\n\nOfficers were called to the scene at 03:15 BST on Sunday.\n\nOf the seven people injured, five have since been released and two remain in hospital recovering from surgery.\n\nBodmin Rugby Club have set up a tribute site for people to remember Michael Allen\n\nA tribute site has been set up at Bodmin Rugby Club, where Mr Allen was a player, for people to gather and remember him.\n\nOfficers will be in attendance to support the local community between 16:00 and 18:00 BST on Monday, and twice daily from 10:00 to 12:00 and then 16:00 to 18:00 for the next week.\n\nThe club said Mr Allen's \"humour and kindness has left a mark on us all, and we will miss him dearly\".\n\nDet Insp Ilona Rosson said police would \"continue to ask the public for their help\" in the investigation.\n\nShe said: \"If you have any information relating to this murder and have yet to have spoken with the police, please come forward immediately.

Watch: Earthquake shakes New York and New Jersey\n\nNew York and cities on the US East Coast are assessing the impact of a rare earthquake that swayed landmarks and cracked roads.\n\nThe magnitude-4.8 quake struck at 10:23 local time (15:23 BST) near Lebanon, New Jersey, and could be felt from Pennsylvania to Connecticut.\n\nResidents spoke of being rocked by a violent rumbling that threw objects around their homes and damaged walls.\n\nOfficials are now conducting safety assessments of infrastructure.\n\nAt least six aftershocks were reported by residents and the United States Geological Survey, including one with a 4.0 magnitude felt around 18:00 local time.\n\nIn New York, the Statue of Liberty was seen swaying during the initial earthquake, while workers and residents across the city's five boroughs reported violent rumbling.\n\nJane Coxwell told the BBC she felt a \"rattling\" like a train passing while she was in a building in lower Manhattan. \"Living in New York I have become accustomed to rattling from the subway. That's what I thought it was,\" she said.\n\n\"Then I realised I was on the ninth floor. It was a bit unsteady for sure. It felt like a passing train.\"\n\nBrooklyn and the Bronx residents reported rattling cupboards, doors and fixtures.\n\nCharita Walcott, a 38-year-old from the Bronx, said the quake felt \"like a violent rumble that lasted about 30 seconds or so\".\n\n\"It was kind of like being in a drum circle, that vibration,\" she said.\n\nAnother New York resident told the BBC's US partner CBS News how their lazy morning suddenly turned. \"I was laying in my bed, and my whole apartment building started shaking. I started freaking out,\" they said.\n\nAt the UN Security Council headquarters, a meeting on Gaza was temporarily paused due to the tremor. \"Is that an earthquake?\" said Save the Children representative Janti Soeripto, who was speaking at the time.\n\nAircraft at two airports - JFK in New York and Newark in New Jersey - were temporarily grounded while runways were inspected.\n\nYet for all of the drama, New York state Governor Kathy Hochul said there had been no reports of major damage or injuries.\n\nMs Hochul warned of aftershocks, but said they are normal and not expected to cause further damage.\n\nThe latest aftershock in the early evening was reported on social media by several users, including the official page for the Empire State Building, which wrote on X: \"Not again\" and \"I'm still fine\".\n\nMs Hochul said that officials had started a damage assessment across the state to ensure the safety of buildings and infrastructure. \"It's been an unsettling day, to say the least,\" she added.\n\nIn the town of Union, New Jersey, about 35 miles from the epicentre, resident David Scibione told CBS how \"things on our roof started coming down\" when the shaking began. And when it had finished, the roads around his house had split from the force.\n\nAllison Martins, also of New Jersey, was recording on TikTok when the rumbling started. Her \"little video on the day in the life of somebody who works from nine to five\" became something more as her camera caught her house shaking.\n\n\"We're not used to having earthquakes in New Jersey, let alone a big one like this; we were all scared,\" she said.\n\nNew Jersey Governor Phil Murphy said his state had also started a safety assessment. His top concern were the Hudson River tunnels, although there were no reports of major damage.\n\n\"The rail tunnels were built in...1911, which is why we're building two new ones,\" he said.\n\nCracks appeared in roads closer to the epicentre - such as here in Union, New Jersey\n\nThe East Coast and New York City are no strangers to earthquakes, although they are rare.\n\nA quake hit near the town of Newcomb in upstate New York with a 5.1 magnitude in 1983, and a 5.0-magnitude tremor was measured in New York City in 1884.\n\nBut the biggest to affect the East Coast was in 2011, when a 5.8 quake in Virginia forced hundreds of thousands of people to evacuate buildings in New York, Washington DC and other cities.\n\nJessica Jobe, of the US Geological Survey, said said that Friday's quake may have happened on an old fault line that had become \"reactivated\".\n\n\"Although there are no known active faults in the area, there are dozens of older inactive faults that formed millions of years ago,\" she said. \"And under the current stresses from tectonic plates moving those faults can be intermittently reactivated.\"\n\nShe added that earthquakes \"can happen anywhere at any time\", but there was only a 3% chance of a 5 magnitude aftershock in the next week.", "The stage show is over, and so is this live text.

If love and compassion could make a person immortal, she would have lived forever.\n\n\"She had a pure heart and was greatly loved for her personality and qualities.\n\n\"She was the most incredible mother to Fatimah and Naeemah, two angels who deserved a beautiful childhood and a full life.\n\n\"Nottingham and the rest of the world have been denied potential future teachers, civil servants, doctors - who knows what they could have been?\n\n\"They lived a short but meaningful life, such was the joy and happiness they brought to us all.\"\n\nBarrow had claimed he did not realise anyone was inside the flat\n\nMrs Hydara's family thanked the Gambian community in the UK and internationally for the support it had offered them since the fatal fire.\n\nThey also thanked Nottinghamshire Police, the Crown Prosecution Service, and the jurors.\n\nBefore they died Mrs Hydara and her children had been planning to move to the US to be with her husband Aboubacarr Drammeh.\n\nDet Insp Kaz Smithson, who led the investigation, said: \"Jamie Barrow committed the most despicable crime anyone could ever commit.\n\n\"He destroyed a whole family and took away their dreams of a happy life together in America.\n\n\"Today, justice has been served for Fatoumatta, Fatimah and Naeemah and their family, all of whom have carried themselves with incredible dignity since the night of this truly awful crime.\n\n\"Barrow denied the killings were deliberate but, thankfully, my investigative team was able to provide overwhelming evidence that this tragic event was indeed murder.\n\n\"We saw through his lies and, thankfully, so did the jury.\"\n\nThe family had been planning a new life overseas\n\nAfter the hearing Nottinghamshire Police said Barrow's motive for starting the fire might never be known but jurors heard one theory was that he wanted to rehoused by local authorities.\n\nCh Insp Karl Thomas said: \"I acknowledge there are many members of the community who believe these murders were a hate crime.\n\n\"It's important to say that, following a very detailed and thorough investigation by a large team of detectives, the investigation team left no stone unturned to investigate the circumstances and presented the evidence to the jury to reach these verdicts.\"\n\nMrs Hydara's husband Aboubacarr Drammeh read a family statement outside court following the verdicts\n\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

So we're told.\n\nSo if there's anyone who can shine a light on this murkiest of stories, surely it's the leader of Belarus. Or so we hope.\n\nWe're part of a small group of journalists invited to the Palace of Independence in Minsk for \"a conversation\" with Mr Lukashenko.\n\nOnly a few weeks ago there'd been feverish speculation about his health. But the Belarusian leader clearly has stamina. The \"conversation\" lasts nearly four hours.\n\nInstead of shining a light, though, he muddies the waters on the recent Russian uprising.\n\nAccording to the agreement between the Wagner Group and the Kremlin, Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin was supposed to move to Belarus, along with some of his fighters.\n\nThat hasn't happened. Not yet anyway.\n\n\"As of this morning,\" says Mr Lukashenko, \"the Wagner fighters, very serious ones, are still in the camps they'd withdrawn to after Bakhmut.\n\n\"As for Yevgeny Prigozhin, he's in St Petersburg. Or perhaps this morning he flew to Moscow. Or perhaps he's somewhere else. But he's not in Belarus.\"\n\nI ask Alexander Lukashenko whether that means the deal is off.\n\nHe denies that. It feels as if there are conversations going on behind the scenes we're not going to be told about.\n\nSteve Rosenberg (L by the door) was among a group of journalists who spent four hours with Mr Lukashenko\n\nWhen it comes to discussing the mutiny, Moscow and Minsk have not exactly been on the same page.\n\nLast weekend Russian state TV declared that President Vladimir Putin had emerged from these dramatic events a hero.\n\n\"I think that no-one came out of that situation a hero,\" Mr Lukashenko tells me.\n\n\"Not Prigozhin, not Putin, not Lukashenko. There were no heroes. And the lesson from this? If we create armed groups like this, we need to keep an eye on them and pay serious attention to them.\"\n\nThe \"conversation\" moves on to nuclear weapons. In particular, the nuclear warheads Russia has said it is moving to Belarus.\n\nOnce a thorn in his side, Alexander Lukashenko became increasingly reliant on Vladimir Putin after the disputed 2020 election\n\n\"God forbid I should ever have to take the decision to use them,\" Mr Lukashenko had said recently, adding, \"But I won't hesitate to use them.\"\n\nI remind him of those comments.\n\n\"Joe Biden could say the same thing, and Prime Minister Sunak,\" Mr Lukashenko replies. \"And my friend Xi Jinping and my Big Brother President Putin.\"\n\n\"But these are not your weapons we're talking about,\" I point out. \"They're Russian ones. It's not your decision to take.\"\n\n\"In Ukraine a whole army is fighting with foreign weapons, isn't it,\" the Belarusian leader retorts. \"Nato weapons. Because they've run out of their own. So why can't I fight with someone else's weapons?\"\n\nBut we're talking nuclear weapons, not pistols, I reply.\n\nAs you can probably guess from his nuclear comments, Alexander Lukashenko is a controversial figure.\n\nThe US, EU and the UK do not recognise him as the legitimate president of Belarus. In 2020 Belarusians poured on to the streets to accuse him of stealing the country's presidential election. The protests were brutally suppressed.\n\n\"For months her relatives and lawyers have been denied access to her in prison. Why?\" I ask.\n\n\"I don't know anything about this,\" he claims.\n\n\"The last time I interviewed you in the autumn of 2021, there were 873 political prisoners in Belarus,\" I remind Mr Lukashenko. \"Now there are 1,500.\"\n\n\"There is no article in our criminal code for political crimes,\" he replies.\n\nThe absence of an article on political crimes doesn't mean there are no political prisoners, I point out.\n\n\"Prisoners cannot be political prisoners, if there's no article,\" he insists. \"How can they be?\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

The opening line-up, which also included Ace Frehley and Peter Criss, became renowned for their iconic face paint.\n\nIn their 1970s heyday the band produced such hits as Rock and Roll All Nite and God of Thunder.\n\nIn 1983 they appeared without face paint for the first time and enjoyed something of a resurgence. This was known as their \"unmasking\". They later re-masked in the late 1990s.\n\nKiss have sold some 100 million records over the past 50 years.\n\nSpeaking to BBC World Business Report, Gene Simmons, widely regarded as the entrepreneurial heart of the band, addressed questions about the scale of monies involved.\n\nHe declined to put a precise figure on it but teased that it might be \"billions of dollars\" before suggesting that would be a tall and \"unfair\" claim.\n\n\"We will be able to pay our rent, but for any amount of money we wouldn't get into bed with the wrong folks,\" he said.\n\n\"The best thing about this deal is who we're doing the deal with, about the collaborative nature and about how we've met our newest best friends for the rest of our lives.\"\n\nAlso speaking to the BBC, Per Sundin, CEO of Pophouse, lauded the partnership.\n\n\"They have a unique IP in the makeup, in the dresses and the personas, and they have fantastic music, and they have fans all over the world in all the generations,\" he told the BBC.\n\nMr Simmons, who sang and played bass for the band, along with his co-founder and co-lead singer Paul Stanley, will continue to be closely involved with the ongoing development of the brand and AI-generated material that leans into the band's library of work.\n\nHe characterised the ongoing relationship as that of a mother to her baby.\n\n\"A mother sees her child grow up and get married or stuff, but you're never gonna get rid of the mom,\" he said. \"You can't just hand it over to somebody, although we have shared vision.\"\n\nKiss are renowned for being prolific marketeers of branded products. Mr Simmons said they had stamped their brand on 5000 products - everything from coffee to condoms and even coffins.\n\nTo a man who also told the BBC that \"more money is always good,\" is there anything they would not sell?\n\n\"Kiss crack is probably not a good idea. No Kiss cigarettes. But the rest of the world is open, why not?

Artists are complaining this has been done without their consent.\n\nGreg Rutkowski says even he would struggle to distinguish between the AI versions of his work and his own\n\nGreg said: \"The first month that I discovered it, I realised that it will clearly affect my career and I won't be able to recognise and find my own works on the internet.\n\n\"The results will be associated with my name, but it won't be my image. It won't be created by me. So it will add confusion for people who are discovering my works.\"\n\n\"All that we've been working on for so many years has been taken from us so easily with AI,\" he added.\n\n\"It's really hard to tell whether this will change the whole industry to the point where human artists will be obsolete. I think my work and future are under a huge question mark.\"\n\nWhile the problems are clear, there are some ways AI tools can be used to benefit artists, according to Cardiff-based animator Harry Hambley, who is the creative force behind internet sensation Ketnipz.\n\n\"I think for me the biggest thing generative art can solve is tedium,\" he said.\n\n\"But it can be scary and the internet's already a wild place, and you mix AI in with that\u2026 we don't know where it's going to go.\n\n\"Do I think that my job will ever be sacrificed to AI or AI will do it better than me? I don't know. I hope not.\"\n\nArtist Harry Hambley says the biggest problem is we do not know how far AI will go\n\nHarry said he thought there was more to art than how it looked.\n\n\"At the end of the day I think that there's a bigger reason why people are invested in Ketnipz and I don't think it's just the mere aesthetics of it.\n\n\"I think there's a personality behind it that I don't think someone imitating can really tap into.\"\n\nJames Lewis's brush control has made him a hit on TikTok\n\nArtist James Lewis, from Cardiff, creates videos of his painting technique for more than seven million followers on TikTok and Instagram.\n\nHe has yet to find out if his work has been used by the tools, but said because AI has learned from billions of artworks, it would be hard to trace which artists' works have been used in each image.\n\n\"If there was a way to go back and figure out who inspired this style of image that was generated, I think it would be fair for that artist to receive some sort of compensation,\" he said.\n\nJames Lewis' piece, Kaboom: \"If there was a way figure out who inspired this style of image... it would be fair to receive some sort of compensation\"\n\nIn the meantime he thinks artists should keep being creative.\n\n\"I do have hope that as much as AI art will develop and it'll get better, but it will never be able to capture that true human essence, that true creativity that we have as people,\" he said.\n\n\"You will still need your own creative ideas, your own initiative.\"\n\nArtist Caroline Sinders says she will be exercising her copyright rights\n\nFor artist and human rights researcher Caroline Sinders, it is for AI companies to address the problem.\n\nShe said: \"Part of the argument we hear from companies is, 'we have so much data, it would be impossible for us to tell, like searching for a needle in a haystack'.\n\n\"I would like to say, well, that's a 'you' problem, not a 'me' problem.\n\n\"I have a copyright on the images and I plan to enact my copyright if my images are used without my consent.\"\n\nShe said she was also worried about the bias that these tools created and how it meant AI art was not reflecting the real world.\n\n\"Let's say we ask an image generation AI system to generate a doctor assessing care to a family,\" she said.\n\n\"Most likely that doctor will be generated as male and probably as white, and the parent will probably be generated as female.\n\n\"And this is not an example I'm randomly making up. There have been tests done by asking these sort of blanket questions without gender being in the text prompt and, more often than not, it's reflecting these stereotypes.\"\n\nThis extends to racial bias and also ableism, said Irene Fubara-Manuel, a lecturer at the University of Sussex.\n\nWhile they said they were excited about the possibilities provided by generative art, issues such as racial and gender biases in some images created were hard to overcome.\n\n\"I was trying to dye my hair over the summer, and I was just looking up 'people of colour, blonde locks',\" they said.\n\nIrene Fubara-Manuel says they noticed bias when searching for images to try out new hairstyles\n\n\"What I got in response was this regal, I would say, fetishised image of black people. You know, chiselled jaw lines, their skin was iridescent.\n\n\"It's like, there are black people who are that beautiful, but the images that you see commonly in a lot of AI are very, very fetishised representations of people.\n\n\"You would not see people who are plus size, or people who have visible disabilities, for instance.\"\n\nArtists are now calling on regulators in the UK and worldwide to take more action to protect artists and the industry.\n\nIrene said artists were not against AI but, \"the argument is against exploitation\".\n\n\"But I'm hopeful that it will contribute to human creativity in general, just like how the creation of computers added more to creativity. I'm excited for its contribution,\" they said.\n\nCaroline said more regulation of the emerging AI industry in the UK would not \"stifle\" innovation.\n\n\"It makes things safer and that's why we have certain laws,\" she said.\n\n\"That's why right now we have seatbelts and airbags for cars and a lot of rules about them. When they were first invented, we didn't have any of that.\n\n\"So it's not at all out of step to sort of ask for, or to create, guardrails and protections.\"\n\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.", "Trevor Jacob bailed out of a solo flight over the Los Padres mountains in California in 2021\n\nA YouTuber who intentionally crashed an aeroplane for views will plead guilty to obstructing a federal investigation by cleaning up the site of the crash, US prosecutors say.\n\nTrevor Jacob, 29, posted the video of the plane crash to YouTube in December 2021, implying it was an accident.

Lacotte told the BBC in 2012 that he accompanied Nureyev on several tours of the city's restaurants, bars and museums.\n\nThis angered the KGB agents who were on the trip, and Nureyev was told he was to be sent home.

Following a statement from chairwoman Baroness Heather Hallett, a film featuring bereaved families will be played. Not one of us was left untouched by the effects of the pandemic, and we all have questions. I asked a range of people who were in the eye of the Covid storm what one question each of them most wants answered.\n\nLobby Akinnola had been due to return to his family home in Royal Leamington Spa, Warkwickshire, to celebrate his 29th birthday when lockdown began in March 2020.\n\nInstead, he stayed at home, in London, apart from his parents and four siblings. A month later, his father, Femi, was dead.\n\n\"It changed my life forever,\" Lobby says. \"He was isolating in the living room of our home and that's where he died. He was 60 and fit and healthy. We never expected him to die.\"\n\nLobby Akinnola wants to ensure the death of his father, Femi, and others were not in vain\n\nFemi is one of nearly 250,000 people killed by Covid in the UK - and Lobby, part of the Covid Bereaved Families for Justice campaign group, wants to ensure these deaths were \"not in vain\".\n\nFor him, the key question is: How can we better protect people when there is another pandemic?\n\nA crucial part of that will be looking at why people belonging to ethnic minorities were at such greater risk. There is no \"physiological reason\" why they had worse outcomes, Lobby says. Instead, he believes it is linked to society - the jobs and housing conditions people belonging to ethnic minorities experience.\n\nBut the people who died from Covid - and those still struggling with complications known as long Covid - are not the only victims of the virus. As restrictions were imposed on the UK, at the start of the pandemic, the government's chief medical adviser, Prof Sir Chris Whitty, warned about the indirect costs. They have been huge.\n\nChildren were unable to attend school, businesses were closed, non-Covid treatment delayed and mixing banned, stopping everything from socialising to seeing dying loved ones in their final days.\n\nThe legacy of that remains, in terms of rising rates of mental-health problems, lost learning and the economic hit. It's also there in the continued high rates of non-Covid deaths and ill health as the impact of missed treatment for conditions such as cancer and heart disease materialises.\n\nSo a crucial element of the inquiry must be to look at why the government imposed restrictions - and whether they were always necessary.\n\nOne senior public health official, who played a key role in the pandemic and is due to give evidence, says it is hard to see how the first lockdown could have been avoided once the virus was here. Put simply: \"We did not know what we were dealing with.\" But after the first wave was over and scientists understood more, the government should not have been so quick to reimpose restrictions.\n\nIn one 80-day period during autumn 2020, England went from few restrictions, to the \"rule of six\" limit to gatherings, tiered levels of restrictions by region, a national lockdown and back to tiers.\n\n\"We had so many rules and regulations people could not keep up,\" the official, who asked not to be named because of rules on what they can say in public ahead of the inquiry, says. \"It was very top down and heavy handed. It goes against all the evidence of what works during disasters.\"\n\nSo they want to know: How did the UK get to have such complex and confusing rules?\n\n\"One of the things Sweden did was rely on the strong social consciousness of their population,\" the official says. \"In the UK, we did not place enough trust in the public - it was damaging.\n\n\"We could have given them good information and guidance and let them act. The public showed throughout they were, on the whole, cautious and responsible.\" And closing schools to all but the most vulnerable children and those of key workers was the \"biggest system failure\" of the pandemic.\n\nUK children spent six months remote learning, with hairdressers and pubs opening before schools in the first lockdown - a decision repeated for hairdressers in Scotland after the second UK-wide lockdown, in early 2021.\n\nEngland's children's commissioner, Dame Rachel de Souza, is extremely worried about the impact this has had on children - even now, school attendance is below its pre-pandemic level.\n\nSo her big ask is: How are we going to support children to recover and avoid such harm in future pandemics?\n\n\"Where they need additional support, be that because they are worried about their mental health or because they have fallen behind at school, they want it quickly,\" Dame Rachel says.\n\nDame Rachel de Souza says children must be prioritised\n\n\"Children sacrificed so much to keep adults safe, we need to make sure we give something back - prioritising their wellbeing.\"\n\nFor Association of Directors of Public Health president Prof Jim McManus, it comes down one basic question: How do we avoid lockdowns in future pandemics?\n\n\"We will only do that if we are better prepared, act at the earliest stage and have good testing and contact tracing in place,\" he says.\n\n\"The UK and much of Europe and North America was largely underprepared for a pandemic of this magnitude - and that cost us.\"\n\nThe UK decided to stop community testing in late March. And in England, it took until May to launch a national large-scale contact-tracing system and September for the government to start giving sick pay to people being asked to isolate\n\nThe way care homes were supported is another topic that needs addressing.\n\nAbout 40% of Covid deaths in the first few months were in care homes, as the lack of testing and personal protective equipment (PPE), heavy use of agency staff and decision to transfer, en masse, hospital patients to care homes let the virus rip through the sector.\n\nAnd NHS workers want the role of austerity during the 2010s examined.\n\nAdult nurse Stuart Tuckwood had never worked in intensive care but was deployed there to look after the sickest Covid patients during the first and second waves, working through breaks to start with because he was worried about using up the limited PPE.\n\n\"The fact I had to work in intensive care because we didn't have enough trained nurses says it all really,\" he says. \"But it wasn't a surprise - staffing shortages were terrible in the lead up to the pandemic.\"\n\nAnd the NHS - and other public services - cannot wait until the end of the inquiry to rectify the problems.\n\nThe first time nurse Stuart Tuckwood worked in intensive care was during the pandemic\n\n\"We need action now,\" Stuart says, \"staff are having to strike to get the pay they need.\"\n\nSo his key question is: What should be done to tackle staffing shortages, so we don't face the situation again?\n\nThe wait for the inquiry is something others are worried about.\n\nOne epidemiologist who advised government during the pandemic and will also be giving evidence to the public inquiry so does not want to be named fears another pandemic could hit before the necessary changes have been made.\n\nSome say the inquiry could well last five years.\n\nThe inquiry team says recommendations will begin next year, as it is being broken down into six different modules.\n\nHowever, the epidemiologist says: \"The modular approach makes sense - but some elements are going to get dragged out too long. We can't wait - pandemics happen every 10 years.\"\n\nThey are particularly concerned with how decision-making became skewed.\n\n\"There was no cost-benefit done on the use of restrictions which we would with other policy decisions,\" the epidemiologist says.\n\nSo they want to know: How should the system be changed \"so we can work out the trade-offs\" of the decisions we make?\n\n\"The phrase 'follow the science' became really unhelpful,\" the epidemiologist says. \"There was no acknowledgement of the uncertainty.\n\n\"Instead, we got trapped into looking at it through a narrow lens of Covid. Even now, I am worried the inquiry has not quite got the focus right.\n\n\"If it just looks at Covid deaths in 2020 and 2021 and not what has been happening with other deaths since, the inquiry will come to the wrong conclusions. This is about more than just the virus.\"", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. \"Patients paying the price\" for strikes, NHS chief executive Amanda Pritchard says\n\nThe head of NHS England has warned that July's planned strikes in the health service could be the worst yet for patients.\n\nAmanda Pritchard said industrial action across the NHS had already caused \"significant\" disruption - and that patients were paying the price.\n\nThis month's consultant strike will bring a \"different level of challenge\" than previous strikes, she said.\n\nJunior doctors and consultants will strike for a combined seven days.\n\nMs Pritchard told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that the work of consultants - who are striking for the first time in a decade - cannot be covered \"in the same way\" as junior doctors.\n\n\"The hard truth is that it is patients that are paying the price for the fact that all sides have not yet managed to reach a resolution,\" she said.\n\nLast month, junior doctors in England voted for five days of strikes in mid-July - their longest strike yet.\n\nThey will walk out between Thursday 13 July and Tuesday 18 July after rejecting a government pay offer.\n\nA few days after that strike ends, on 20 and 21 July, hospital consultants in England will strike over pay.\n\nNegotiators for consultants and junior doctors have been asking for a 35% pay increase to make up for what they say are 15 years of below-inflation rises - a figure Health Secretary Steve Barclay called unaffordable.\n\nInstead, junior doctors have been offered a 5% rise this year, which was rejected, while there has been no offer so far for consultants.\n\nConsultants are also calling for reforms to the doctors' pay review body to ensure the issue is \"fixed for the future\". Mr Barclay told Laura Kuenssberg he is \"ready to have discussions\" on other issues, such as how consultants' pay progresses over time.\n\nHealth Secretary Steve Barclay said he was prepared to negotiate with consultants\n\n\"There's things we're open to discussing, but we need to get the balance right,\" he said.\n\nThe health service has been plagued by strike action throughout this year, with doctors, nurses, ambulance workers, porters and others walking out in disputes, mainly over pay.\n\nA breakthrough came in May, when unions representing all NHS staff except doctors and dentists backed a deal to receive a 5% pay rise.\n\nHowever, junior doctors and hospital consultants have still not reached an agreement with the government.\n\nHealth is a devolved issue, meaning this only relates to the NHS in England.\n\nMs Pritchard acknowledged that it would be several years before the situation in the health sector returned to anything like good enough, and stressed that the service was doing all it could to bring waiting lists down.\n\nNHS England says more than 600,000 appointments have been cancelled in previous strikes. The ongoing failure of the government and some of the medical unions to find agreement is only going to crank the pressure up still further.\n\nMs Pritchard called for the industrial action to be brought to an end as soon as possible, saying it cannot become \"business as usual in the NHS\".\n\nShe also discussed NHS England's new 15-year workforce plan, which she introduced alongside Prime Minister Rishi Sunak earlier this week.\n\nThe NHS currently has one out of every 10 posts unfilled, creating major pressure on staff and leading to long waiting times for patients.\n\nThe new plan is focused on training and retaining more staff. Ms Pritchard said the plan is not an \"overnight\" fix , but that it is part of efforts to \"treat people as quickly as possible, without delay\".\n\nAlso on the show was former Conservative health minister Lord Bethell who described the current approach to treatment in the NHS as \"rationing\".\n\n\"If someone has a need for an operation and you simply don't have the resources to give them what they need then you are going beyond the important protocols of allocating scarce resources in the best way possible and you are being defined by the amount of resources that you have available,\" he said.\n\n\"I think that there is a difference between reasonable allocation of resources and making tough decision which is part of every day life, and having to cope with a system as overwhelmed with illness.\"", "Tewkesbury Academy was locked down following the attack on Monday morning but reopened on Tuesday\n\nA teenage boy has been charged after a teacher was stabbed in a corridor at a school.\n\nThe 15-year-old was charged with attempted wounding with intent and possession of bladed article following the attack at Tewkesbury Academy.\n\nMaths teacher Jamie Sansom was wounded just after 09:00 BST on Monday.\n\nThe boy, who cannot be named due to his age, remains in police custody and will appear at Cheltenham Magistrates' Court on Wednesday.\n\nHe was arrested in Stoke Orchard, some three miles (4.8km) from the school, about two hours after the stabbing.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Mr Sansom, who has taught at Tewkesbury Academy since 2017, said he had not been breaking up a fight between students when he was wounded.\n\nHe said he was \"recovering well\" from his injuries and hoped to be back in the classroom before the summer break if doctors gave him the \"all-clear\".\n\nPolice said he suffered a single stab wound and was taken to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital and was discharged later the same day.\n\nJamie Sansom said he had received more than 100 messages of support, which he described as \"a big boost\"\n\nThe academy was locked down and two neighbouring schools were also asked to shut their doors as a precaution following the incident, Gloucestershire Police said on Monday.\n\nIt added there would be a police presence at the school over the coming days to provide reassurance to pupils.\n\nFollow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

I think it's going to continue here with the schedule we have and pitches like that, players are going to get injured.\"\n\nHe added that facilities need to improve to \"keep players on the pitch\".\n\nOn Friday a WSL spokesperson said pitches at WSL stadiums are monitored throughout the season with \"steps taken\" to support clubs where necessary.\n\nArsenal have already been impacted by serious injuries to key players this season including captain Kim Little, Ballon d'Or runner-up Mead and last season's top scorer Vivianne Miedema.\n\n'With you every step of the way' - support for Williamson\n\nChelsea manager Emma Hayes said Williamson will be a \"devastating loss\" for the Lionesses and Arsenal.\n\n\"[She is] someone who has had a profound impact on club and country [so it's] disappointing to see such a huge injury again,\" said Hayes.\n\n\"I've said this many times - I think we need to stay away from lazy comments about the causes of these injuries. It's multi-faceted.\"\n\nOn social media the England national team responded on Instagram: \"You'll come back stronger than ever.\"\n\nTeam-mate Mead said on Twitter : \"We are with you every step of the way, even if I have to be quiet some days in rehab.\n\n\"We got you girl, all the love and strength in the world.\"\n\nMeanwhile Fifpro, a global union for professional footballers, said on Twitter: \"As news of Leah Williamson's World-Cup-ending ACL injury breaks, the words of her England team-mate Beth Mead have never rung truer.\n\nIt is the worst possible news for Sarina Wiegman with three months to go until the World Cup.\n\nWilliamson's importance to England cannot be understated. She is the captain, part of a formidable centre-back partnership with Millie Bright and a calming influence on her team-mates.\n\nShe started and captained every game as England won Euro 2022 last summer and played in 22 of the Lionesses' incredible 30-match unbeaten run.\n\nWith Arsenal team-mate Beth Mead already ruled out with an ACL injury, England are now almost certainly without last summer's top scorer and their captain, while Chelsea's Fran Kirby and Bright are currently on the injury list, adding to concerns.\n\u2022 None A warm-hearted Aussie rom-com about a flawed, funny couple getting it all utterly wrong\n\u2022 None Explore the other side of the games you love: A collection of documentaries about The Dark Side of Sport", "A UN official says the Israeli attack which killed seven staff of the charity World Central Kitchen (WCK) is either a \"dreadful failure of deconfliction\" or evidence that the system that exists now is not fit for purpose.\n\nThe official, who has extensive experience in Gaza and asked not to be identified, said that the greatest fear of aid workers is that the Civilian Liaison Administration, the branch of the Israeli military tasked with co-ordinating with humanitarian organisations, \"doesn't really have a grip\".\n\nWhat's known as \"deconfliction\" is a system that allows aid organisations to work in some of the world's hottest conflicts, including Yemen, Ukraine, Syria and Gaza.\n\nIt generally takes two forms. One is \"notification\" - making sure that the relevant military powers know where humanitarian organisations are located (including providing GPS co-ordinates of all facilities) and where vehicles are expected to be moving at any given time on any given day.\n\n\"Co-ordination\" is a more detailed level, involving real-time communication with the CLA while humanitarian teams are actually on the move.\n\nIt's designed to make sure that all military personnel along the route know exactly where vehicles are.\n\n\"The whole apparatus, whether it's a drone operator, a radar operator, a guy in a tank, a guy at a checkpoint, a sniper on the roof, they're all aware that in the next 20 minutes, five white cars are going to come down the road. So no-one is surprised,\" Giorgios Petropoulos, head of the Gaza sub-office of the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) told me.\n\nA trip from Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip to Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, he said, could involve as many as eight conversations to make sure the journey goes smoothly.\n\nJan Egeland, head of the Norwegian Refugee Council, told the BBC the relationship between aid groups and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) needed to be reset.\n\n\"If they shoot at anything moving as it seems here, with a deconflicted and notified convoy, there has to be a complete reboot in the relationship between the Israeli war machine and all of us aid groups,\" he said.\n\nIsrael has acknowledged it killed the WCK staff. \"We will do everything so that this thing does not happen again,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.\n\nAid workers in Gaza agree that the area is one of the most challenging places in the world for humanitarian workers to operate.\n\n\"Gaza is a shitty place to work,\" one told me. The aid worker said the existing deconfliction system was not working properly.\n\n\"The notification system essentially doesn't work,\" they added. \"It's not a disciplined system from the Israeli side.\"\n\nThe aid worker said there had been \"some pretty dramatic failures\", including an incident on 5 February in which Israeli naval fire hit an UNRWA convoy (carrying food from World Central Kitchen) as it headed up the coast road towards the north. The incident forced the UN to suspend aid convoys to the north.\n\nThe IDF said at the time that it was looking into the incident, in which no-one was hurt.\n\nHowever, Monday's deadly incident is a disaster: for WCK, the people of Gaza, and Israel's image.\n\nAs Israel moves to ban UNRWA - the main UN organisation responsible for the welfare of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip - it has come to rely heavily on other humanitarian organisations.\n\nMr Netanyahu's government has accused UNWRA of employing more than 2,000 members of Hamas, the Palestinian armed group which attacked Israel on 7 October last year.\n\nWCK, which has been on the ground for months and which had just brought in a second 400-tonne shipment of aid by sea from Cyprus, had been playing an increasingly prominent and important role in preventing Gaza from sliding into famine.\n\nIsrael has trumpeted the role of WCK and other aid organisations as proof UNRWA is no longer needed.\n\nAt a recent briefing, Israeli diplomats said WCK had \"come out of nowhere and has become around 13% of the food story inside Gaza\".\n\nIsrael also says it is doing everything in its power to facilitate the distribution of aid throughout the Gaza Strip.\n\nBut WCK has now suspended its operations in Gaza. Meanwhile, Mr Egeland said that movement between Gaza's south - where most aid enters, via two crossings from Israel and Egypt - and its north \"will again be completely paralysed. And that is extremely serious, because it's in the north that famine is already taking a grip.\"\n\nHe added that the WCK suspending operations \"means more famine, more dead children, more epidemic disease because people are so malnourished\".\n\nMr Egeland urged Israel to open more crossing points into Gaza.\n\n\"Let me remind all that there are two border crossings minutes away from the north, they are called Karni crossing and Erez crossing, and Israel has refused to open them for aid convoys,\" he said.\n\n\"Israel can open the borders for organised relief and safety. They are not willing to do that.\"", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nWith temperatures soaring to more than 40C at this time of the year, I normally sleep outside in my garden, but I am too scared to do that now, as fighter jets roar over my home in Sudan's Omdurman city - despite the latest ceasefire.\n\nI live with my mother and siblings in the centre of Omdurman, just over the River Nile from the capital, Khartoum.\n\nThe fighter jets are a constant reminder that Sudan is now in a state of war.

We hid in our homes, as it is too dangerous to even look out of our windows.\n\nFrom morning to evening, ceasefire or no ceasefire, fighter jets fly past our neighbourhood, coming from the same military airport from where foreign nationals have been evacuated, and heading towards Khartoum to strike at positions of the RSF.\n\nFrom all the reports I have received, most of Khartoum is controlled by RSF fighters, with hardly any army soldiers - or police officers - on the streets.\n\nThe RSF fires anti-aircraft artillery to try and bring down the fighter jets, but I am not aware of any aircraft that has been shot down.\n\nThree days ago, some of the projectiles landed in an open field in my neighbourhood. Luckily, they missed a nearby mosque and homes.\n\nThe RSF has its origins in the war that broke out in Darfur two decades ago, and is made up of the Janjaweed militiamen who helped the government crush a rebellion there.\n\nIt had around 20,000 men before the fall of long-time ruler Omar al-Bashir in 2019, but has since turned into a force with an estimated 80,000 to 100,000 fighters.\n\nIt built a strong presence in cities and towns across Sudan, but many of its fighters have now been deployed to Khartoum as RSF commander Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, better known as Hemedti, fights army commander Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan for power.\n\nThe city is dotted with checkpoints, manned by RSF fighters in pick-up trucks.\n\nHamid Khalafallah, from the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, told the BBC's Newsday programme that people risk their lives every time they have to negotiate their way past.\n\n\"It's basically a gamble.

You then need to work out what's going on. You might need the haematologist or the radiologist to report those scans.\n\n\"Without those, the front door literally breaks down overnight and that's the difficulty here - the whole system's under pressure.\"\n\nMany of the clinical leaders spoke of using staff differently - moving away from the traditional nurse and doctor model, to include more physiotherapists, advanced nurse practitioners and physicians associates.\n\nThat in turn \"blurs some of the professional boundaries\" by giving staff more responsibility, freeing colleagues.\n\n\"It's a very difficult time for the NHS and morale is low, but I came back to the Glam because I loved the morale here and the team effort and certainly I'm very lucky to work within a team that is beaten up,\" said Dr Samuel.\n\n\"But they're still one.

Watch: Labour's Emily Thornberry says \"of course\" she backs the controversial advert\n\nThe advert has attracted cross-party criticism, and comes amid reports Labour will publish further attack adverts this week on other issues as part of the build-up to local elections in England, which will take place on 4 May.\n\nThe Times says the attack ads will blame the prime minister \"personally\" for \"crashing the economy and for soaring mortgage and council tax rates\".\n\nOn Monday Labour published another attack advert on Twitter, criticising Mr Sunak for raising taxes on working people when his family benefitted from \"a tax loophole\".\n\nThe ad makes reference to Labour's pledge to scrap non-dom tax status, which allows people to avoid paying UK tax on earnings from outside the country.\n\nLast year it emerged that Mr Sunak's wife had non-dom status, although she later said should would start paying UK tax on her overseas income.\n\nOther adverts already published as part of the series have focused on theft and gun crime, also featuring the image and signature of Mr Sunak.\n\nIn his Daily Mail piece, Sir Keir blames the government for a number of failures on crime, highlighting low prosecution rates for rape and burglary.\n\nHighlighting his former role as the director of public prosecutions in England and Wales between 2008 to 2013 - the person who leads the Crown Prosecution Service and one of the country's leading legal officials - Sir Keir writes his life's work has \"been about making our country safer and more secure\".\n\nHe said he would make \"zero apologies\" for \"being blunt and that when 4,500 abusers aren't sent to prison, people want answers rather than excuses from politicians\".\n\nLabour told the BBC that the statistic featured in the original advert - \"4,500 adults convicted or sexually assaulting children under 16 who served no prison time\" - came from Ministry of Justice statistics for England and Wales from 2010 to 2022.\n\nThose figures are accurate for adults who were convicted but received a community sentence or a suspended sentence, rather than being sent to prison.\n\nThe figure covers both sexual assault of a child and sexual activity with a child - Labour's advert says the figure relates to sexual assault only, although its press release mentions both categories.\n\nLabour sources said the party will now be turning its attention this week to the cost of living - though Mr Sunak himself will remain in their firing line.\n\nThe advert about jailing those who sexually assault children has drawn criticism by politicians from all major parties - and caused an internal row within Labour.\n\nIt was reported at the weekend by the Observer that shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, was not told about it ahead of its release.\n\nLord Blunkett, who served as home secretary under Tony Blair, said it was \"deeply offensive to get down in the gutter to fight politics in this way\" and called for the advert to be withdrawn.\n\nLib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said it was \"wrong\" to attack individuals personally, \"particularly when it's over subjects which are so sensitive and so important to the British people\".\n\nJudges and magistrates, rather than the prime minister of the day, are responsible for handing out sentences.\n\nThe figures Labour highlighted cover the period since 2010, five years before Mr Sunak entered Parliament. He did not become prime minister until October last year.\n\nSir Keir was director of public prosecutions from 2008 to 2013, meaning the figures also cover three of the years he was in the post.", "The River Etherow runs close to Hodge Lane, where the rescue operation was launched\n\nA teenager has died after getting into difficulty in water in Greater Manchester.\n\nPolice say the 15-year-old girl died despite the best efforts of medical teams after they were called to the village of Broadbottom in Tameside.\n\nA large rescue operation was launched near Hodge Lane, a small road which runs close to the River Etherow.\n\nDetective Superintendent Rebecca Boyce said the death was \"nothing short of devastating\".\n\nPolice were called to the scene at around 19:50 BST on Wednesday night, and were assisted by ambulance crews and the fire and rescue service.\n\nA statement from Greater Manchester Police said enquiries are ongoing but investigators were \"confident there aren't any suspicious circumstances\".\n\nDet Supt Rebecca Boyce said: \"Yesterday evening's events are nothing short of devastating and my deepest sympathies are with the loved ones of the girl who lost her life in such awful circumstances.\n\n\"Officers will continue to support the family during this incredibly difficult time.\"\n\nIt comes amid warnings from the RNLI and other safety groups about the dangers of open water during the summer months.\n\nOf the 226 accidental drowning deaths in 2022, almost half happened in June, July and August, according to the National Fire Chiefs Council.\n\nThe statistics reveal that people are almost twice as likely to lose their lives in inland bodies of water like lakes and rivers than they are at sea.\n\nThe RNLI has come under pressure in some areas in recent days during the heatwave which has hit parts of the UK.\n\nRescue crews were called out to Blackpool nine time in four days during last weekend's hot weather, while seven people had to be rescued off Devon in a single day on 30 May.\n\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

Militants in Gaza swiftly responded by firing rockets at southern Israel, prompting Israel warplanes to bomb sites there linked to Hamas.\n\nJordan and Egypt, both involved in recent Washington-backed efforts to de-escalate tensions between Israel and the Palestinians, were also highly critical of Israel's actions.\n\nFears of further confrontations in the coming days are now heightened, particularly if Israeli officials such as the far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir make a visit, or if Israeli police allow Jewish activists to pray at the sensitive site, breaking fragile, decades-old rules which apply there.\n\n\"We are always concerned about the attempts of Jewish extremists to upset the status quo,\" Dr Mustafa Abu Sway, an Islamic scholar and member of the Islamic Waqf Council in Jerusalem, told me earlier this week.\n\nHe said the important last 10 days of Ramadan which begin next Tuesday, leading into Laylat al-Qadr, the Night of Power, were a particular issue.\n\n\"Historically, Israel as an occupying force prevented Jewish extremists from entering during these 10 days. But with such a government in place, we are concerned that they will allow it,\" he said.\n\nIsraeli authorities insist that they act to preserve freedom of worship at the religious site, which plays a highly symbolic role in the nationalist narratives of Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nIt is believed by Muslims to be the location where the Prophet Muhammad ascended to Heaven, while Jews revere it as the site of two Biblical temples, the second of which was destroyed in Roman times.\n\nDid you witness the violence?

Scotland's social justice secretary says the government must stand up for the will of the Scottish Parliament.\n\nThe Scottish government is to launch a legal challenge to Westminster's block on its controversial gender reforms.\n\nThe proposals, which would allow people in Scotland to self-identify their sex, were passed by the Scottish Parliament in December last year.\n\nBut they were blocked by the UK government over their potential impact on UK-wide equality laws.\n\nFirst Minister Humza Yousaf has previously described that move as an \"undemocratic veto\".\n\nHe was the only one of the three candidates in the SNP leadership contest who backed taking legal action in an attempt to overturn the block.\n\nHis predecessor, Nicola Sturgeon, had described the block as a \"full-frontal attack on our democratically-elected Scottish Parliament\" and said that legal action was inevitable.\n\nShirley-Anne Somerville, Scotland's social justice secretary, said the Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill had been passed by an \"overwhelming majority of the Scottish Parliament, with support from members of all parties\".\n\nShe said the block by the UK government was an \"unprecedented challenge to the Scottish Parliament's ability to legislate on clearly devolved matters\".\n\nMs Somerville added: \"To uphold the democratic decision of the parliament, and ensure proper protection of devolution, Scottish ministers will now lodge a petition for judicial review of the secretary of state's decision.\n\nShe is expected to make a statement to the Scottish Parliament after the Easter break setting out details of her plans for a court challenge.\n\nFirst Minister Humza Yousaf has described the block as undemocratic\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak defended the UK government's decision to block the gender recognition reforms, saying it had been based on \"very careful and considered advice\".\n\nHe added: \"We had concerns about how Scotland's gender recognition act would interact with reserved powers, about the operation of the Equalities Act, the protection of women elsewhere in the UK as well.\n\n\"Obviously there's a court process, we will follow that through.\"\n\nThe gender reforms have been divisive within the SNP, with another of the leadership candidates, Ash Regan, resigning from the government last year over her fears about their impact on safeguards for women and girls.\n\nA recent opinion poll by Panelbase for the Sunday Times suggested that 18% of Scottish voters think Mr Yousaf should launch a legal challenge, while 44% said that he should abandon the reforms and 24% believed a compromise should be found with the UK government.\n\nShortly after the reforms were passed, double rapist Isla Bryson - who changed gender after being arrested for attacking two women - was remanded to a women's jail.\n\nBryson was subsequently moved to a male prison after the case sparked widespread anger. Ministers insisted the new legislation had no impact on the decision about where Bryson was held.\n\nScottish Conservative deputy leader Meghan Gallacher claimed that the legal challenge was a \"painfully transparent attempt by Humza Yousaf to divert attention from the civil war engulfing the SNP and the huge question marks over the party's finances\".\n\nBut the Scottish Greens, who have a power sharing agreement with the SNP, said the move was \"vital for equality and democracy\".\n\nHe's barely got his feet under the table at Bute House, but Humza Yousaf has already been pitched into a constitutional showdown with the UK government.\n\nThere is an extent to which the new first minister has been painted into a corner here. He only had until Monday to decide whether to challenge the UK government's unprecedented veto of Holyrood's gender reforms.\n\nHis SNP leadership campaign also promised to maintain the partnership with the Greens - and anything short of a full-throated defence of the reforms would have seen them walk.\n\nBut Mr Yousaf has also signed up to this fight completely voluntarily.\n\nHe deliberately founded much of his leadership platform on social justice issues, and said he would continue the agenda started by Nicola Sturgeon.\n\nAnd while crafting his own identity as first minister, he will not want to start by shying away from a confrontation with UK ministers on the topic of Holyrood's powers.\n\nIt is a risky strategy given how this issue has divided his party. But this is a battle Mr Yousaf is now fully committed to.\n\nMr Yousaf has previously said he would only launch a court challenge to the UK government's block if he was given legal advice that it stood a chance of succeeding.\n\nBut former Supreme Court judge Lord Hope has said the Scottish government's chances of winning a court case are \"very low\".\n\nThe former deputy president of the Supreme Court said the Scottish legislation \"most certainly does\" impact on the Equality Act 2010 and the existing Gender Recognition Act 2004, which currently apply across Great Britain.\n\nAnd he said it was difficult to see how a court would not agree that Scottish Secretary Alister Jack had \"acted reasonably\" in blocking the reforms through the use of a Section 35 order.\n\nThe Scottish secretary is able to use a Section 35 to block legislation passed by Holyrood if he believes it would have a detrimental impact on areas that are reserved to Westminster.\n\nIt is the first time a Section 35 has been used since the Scottish Parliament was created in 1999.\n\nFormer SNP minister Alex Neil told BBC Scotland earlier on Wednesday that \"every lawyer I have spoken to has told me we don't have a cat in hell's chance of winning\" a legal battle.\n\nHe said Mr Yousaf should instead focus on reintroducing the legislation after its \"deficiencies\" had been addressed.\n\nOpponents of the gender reforms are concerned about their potential impact on single-sex spaces and other protections for women and girls\n\nSusan Smith, co-director of the For Women Scotland group - which opposes the gender self-identification reforms - said Mr Yousaf was \"remarkably foolish\" to take legal action over legislation that is \"wildly unpopular\".\n\nShe added: \"It is widely predicted that they will lose, so it seems like an incredible waste of everybody's time and money to go through this when there are other really pressing matters\".\n\nHowever, the announcement of a legal challenge was welcomed by Vic Valentine, the manager of Scottish Trans, who said the UK government's block was \"unacceptable\".\n\nThey added: \"Other countries all over the world have introduced similar laws, with the only impact being a positive one.\"\n\nColin Macfarlane, the director of nations at Stonewall, said the UK government's \"unprecedented\" block had \"made clear that they see trans people as a threat to be contained rather than people to be treated with dignity and respect\".\n\nThe reforms are intended to make it easier for people to change their legally-recognised sex by doing away with the need for a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria - a sense of unease that a person may have because of a mismatch between their biological sex and their gender identity.\n\nApplicants for a gender recognition certificate would need to have lived in their acquired gender for three months rather than the current two years.\n\nAnd the minimum age that someone can apply to change their sex will be cut from 18 to 16 - although 16 and 17-year-olds would need to have lived as their acquired gender for six months rather than three.", "Ukraine's army has released footage appearing to show drones delivering water bottles to people stranded by floodwaters in Russian-controlled areas of the Kherson region.\n\nWater from the destroyed Kakhovka dam has engulfed the area, causing thousands to flee and sparking a humanitarian disaster.\n\nRead the latest on the dam disaster here.", "More children are thought to be absent from school on Fridays\n\nSome pupils have missed school on Fridays since the pandemic because their parents are at home, England's children's commissioner has said.\n\nThe number of pupils regularly missing school in England remains higher than pre-Covid levels.\n\nDame Rachel de Souza told MPs there was \"a huge amount\" of absence on Fridays - when \"mum and dad are at home\" - that \"wasn't there before\".\n\nThe government said it is providing help for regularly absent children.\n\nPupils count as persistently absent if they miss 10% or more of school sessions, which would amount to seven days in the autumn term.\n\nDame Rachel told the Commons Education Select Committee on Tuesday that 818,000 of the 1.6 million children who were persistently absent across the autumn and spring terms in 2021/22 were off school for reasons other than illness.\n\nAnd some pupils are missing school on Fridays more than on other days of the week, she said - a trend that did not exist before the pandemic - citing analysis of attendance data from autumn 2021, covering 32,000 children from three multi-academy trusts.\n\nDame Rachel said conversations with families suggested one reason for lower school attendance was that remote learning during lockdown had led to an attitude of \"Well, why can't we just have online learning?\"\n\nShe added: \"Parents are at home on Fridays. We've had evidence from kids: 'Well, you know, mum and dad are at home - stay at home'.\"\n\nOne survey published last year suggested only 13% of UK workers go into the office on a Friday. However, the Office for National Statistics says most people do not work from home.\n\nThe Education Select Committee has launched an inquiry into why persistent absence has grown since the pandemic.\n\nA quarter (25.1%) of pupils were persistently absent last term, compared with 13.1% in the autumn term of 2019. The increase was partly driven by high levels of flu and other viruses, the government said at the time.\n\nResponding to Dame Rachel's comments on Tuesday, a Department for Education spokesperson said: \"The vast majority of children are in school and learning but we are offering targeted help for children who are regularly absent.\n\n\"This includes working with schools, trusts, governing bodies, and local authorities to identify pupils who are at risk of becoming, or who are persistently absent and working together to support that child to return to regular and consistent education.\"", "Nitrous oxide, sold in metal canisters, can lead to a vitamin deficiency that damages nerves in the spinal column\n\nPossessing laughing gas is to be made a criminal offence for the first time, the government has announced.\n\nThere will also be tighter controls on retailers to prevent the supply of nitrous oxide for misuse.\n\nIt goes against recommendations from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) which recently advised against new laws to ban nitrous oxide.\n\nNitrous oxide, sold in metal canisters, is known as NOS and is one of the most-used drugs by UK 16 to 24-year-olds.\n\nThe details are expected to be released on Monday. The BBC understands the ban would be issued under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, which regulates drugs based on their perceived harm and potential for misuse.\n\nIt is already illegal to produce or supply the gas for its psychoactive effects under the Psychoactive Substances Act 2016. The law makes production, supply and importation of nitrous oxide for human consumption illegal, but not possession.\n\nThe change is part of a crackdown on anti-social behaviour, which Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will announce on Monday for England and Wales.\n\nThe plans will also give police and councils additional powers to deal with people who are \"causing nuisance\" by blocking shop doorways, asking for money at cash machines or leaving their belongings on pavements.\n\nThese people will then be \"directed towards the support they need\", such as accommodation, mental health or substance misuse services.\n\n\"The debris and paraphernalia which causes blight will then be cleared,\" the government added.\n\nOutlining the reasons behind the nitrous oxide ban, the government said it was \"concerned about the rise in health and social harms\" of laughing gas, \"particularly to young people\".\n\n\"We are for the first time making possession of nitrous oxide an offence; preventing supply for misuse by putting tighter controls on retailers; and giving greater powers to law enforcement to take action against those who are in breach,\" it added.\n\nSpeaking on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Michael Gove said: \"We are doing this because if you walk through any urban park you will see these little silver cannister which are the evidence of people regarding public spaces as arenas for drug taking.\n\n\"It is unacceptable. People should feel those spaces are being looked after in a way which means they are safe for children.\"\n\nThe levelling up secretary said the drug has an \"intoxicating and potentially damaging effect on young brains and young nervous systems\".\n\nHeavy use can lead to a vitamin deficiency that damages nerves in the spinal column.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nSeveral drugs charities have criticised the announcement, claiming criminalising possession could lead to the drug becoming more dangerous.\n\nSteve Rolles, senior policy analyst at the Transform Drug Policy Foundation, said: \"The idea that this is a deterrent effect is ridiculous it just criminalises users and will hand control of the product to criminal gangs.\n\n\"This is just political theatre - if you need any proof you just need to see that they have ignored their own advisers. This is a particularly ugly example of performative politics.\"\n\nTransform Drug Policy Foundation is a charity which campaigns for drugs to be legalised and regulated.\n\nProf Adam Winstock, an addiction medicine specialist and founder of the Global Drug Survey, told the BBC that getting a criminal record \"is going to be a far greater harm than the risks for the vast majority of people using nitrous oxide\".\n\nReducing the risks of nitrous oxide is \"better achieved with smart education, not blunt regulation that may compound existing harms and create new ones\", he added.\n\nEarlier this year the Home Office asked the ACMD to provide advice on whether to make possession of nitrous oxide a crime.\n\nThe report recommended the substance should not be controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act - which allows the use of life sentences for those supplying or producing some drugs.\n\nThe ACMD stated the Psychoactive Substances Act - which limits prison sentences to a maximum of seven years - \"remains appropriate legislation\".\n\nIt said sanctions for the offences would be disproportionate with the level of harm associated with nitrous oxide, as well as creating \"significant burdens\" for legitimate uses of the substance.\n\nThe review also found \"no substantive evidence of links between nitrous oxide and anti-social behaviour\" aside from littering.\n\nAlexandre Piot, director of research at the Conservative Drug Policy Reform Group, said it was \"shocking that the government feels it knows better than its own independent body of experts set up by law\".\n\n\"The more they don't listen to them, the more drug policy will continue to fail,\" he said.\n\nNitrous oxide is regularly used as an anaesthetic in medicine and dentistry, and as a gas for making whipped cream in cooking.\n\nLabour backed the plans to ban the sale of nitrous oxide. Shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell said its use \"causes a huge amount of littering disruption and anti-social behaviour\".\n\nShe added: \"We do need to tackle at source these kind of behaviours that are blights on our community.\"\n\nIt comes as the government unveils a new strategy to crack down on anti-social behaviour.\n\nPublic drug use, fly-tipping and low-level crimes such as graffiti are to be targeted with a strategy of \"hotspot\" policing and \"short and sharp\" punishments.\n\nPeople who vandalise public spaces will have to repair the damage they cause within 48 hours of being given an order.\n\nA pilot, covering 10 areas, aims to show the public such acts are \"quickly and visibly\" punished.\n\nMs Powell said the plans \"amount to nothing\".\n\nLabour have also accused the government of cutting neighbourhood policing, leading to fewer offenders being punished.\n\n\"We've heard it all before from this government and I think we have to judge them by their record,\" Ms Powell added.", "The group said they had nothing to do with the decision to pull the track.\n\nThe Proclaimers have spoken for the first time about the decision to pull their most famous song from an official Coronation playlist.\n\nThe Scottish duo's hit I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles) was initially included in the list, curated by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport.\n\nBut the song was later removed following complaints about the brothers' well-known republican views.\n\nCraig and Charlie Reid appeared bemused and said the row had passed them by.\n\n\"We didn't know it was going on and we didn't know it was coming off,\" they told BBC Radio Scotland's Afternoon Show.\n\nCraig said he had first heard at the end of last year that the song had been suggested for use at Coronation celebrations.\n\nIt featured on the Spotify playlist alongside Queen, The Beatles, David Bowie, Kate Bush, Electric Light Orchestra and some other top UK artists.\n\n\"I don't think it's the royals themselves that do it, I think they probably get a company to cobble together whatever,\" he added.\n\n\"I didn't give it a second thought and then a few weeks ago they said that it's been taken off because of our republican views.\"\n\nThe brothers have been outspoken in the past about the monarchy, describing their 2007 song In Recognition as \"our overwhelming contempt for people on the left in this country who snipe against the Royal Family and then end up taking honours\".\n\nBut while they describe themselves as lifelong republicans, Charlie Reid said they had nothing to do with the decision to remove the song from the playlist.\n\n\"We're presuming some 'Bufton Tufton' from Tunbridge Wells has complained but who knows?\" he said\n\n\"Maybe somebody at a newspaper does it to create a story and I believe these things go on. We'll never really know and it's better that we don't.\"", "It is crunch time for Dominic Raab.\n\nIn the coming hours, the deputy prime minister will discover his fate.\n\nThere are three possible eventualities: He is sacked. He resigns. He stays on.\n\nAll of this relates to allegations of bullying, which Mr Raab denies.\n\n\"If an allegation of bullying is upheld, I would resign,\" Mr Raab has said.\n\nBack in November, five months ago, the government appointed a senior lawyer, Adam Tolley KC, to conduct an independent investigation into complaints about his conduct.\n\n\"The investigation should be completed as swiftly as possible,\" the terms of reference stated, almost 150 days ago.\n\nThis clearly hasn't proved straight forward, or, it would seem, particularly limited in its scope.\n\n\"The independent investigator will report to the prime minister on his investigation.

This inquiry has been going on for almost five months.\n\nIn other words, the future of Mr Sunak's deputy, the man who loyally and publicly campaigned for him to be prime minister until the very point of his defeat by Liz Truss in last summer's leadership election, has hung over them both for almost as long as Mr Sunak has been in 10 Downing Street.\n\nSpeaking to senior folk in government privately, most assume that Mr Raab - who is also justice secretary - is \"toast\" as one figure put it to me.\n\n\"The breadth of this, the number of people complaining, surely he can't survive?\" said another.\n\n\"He's got to be done for, so many people think he's a nightmare,\" one minister told me.\n\n\"How does he go home to his wife and kids when there have been so many headlines about him about this stuff?\" another said. \"To his credit, mind you, he manages to. He's been getting on with things.\"\n\nOthers are much, much more circumspect.\n\nFew dispute he is quite the taskmaster to work for, but say that is a million miles from him being a bully. All this has already proved politically and financially costly to Mr Raab.\n\nFor months, questions about his conduct have followed his every public move.\n\nHe was taunted about it when he stood in for Rishi Sunak at Prime Minister's Questions recently, which must have been excruciating for him.\n\nAnd Mr Raab has picked up his own legal fees during this investigation.\n\nSome believe the report will be terrible for Mr Raab. One source suggested the process had taken so long because of the scale of claims made against him and Mr Tolley's desire to ensure the process is scrupulous.\n\nSo how might things pan out?\n\nWhat happens if the prime minister concludes the report from Mr Tolley means Mr Raab can carry on?\n\nSome will ask what all the fuss was about and wonder if some civil servants are insufficiently thick skinned to deal with a demanding boss.\n\nSome of the complainants might feel a deep sense of injustice, and choose to speak out.\n\nThose with deep knowledge of the government machinery wonder how the Ministry of Justice would be able to properly function, given the complaints from within that department about the secretary of state.\n\nBluntly, there are civil servants there who want him out. Mr Raab knows that. And yet he'd still be there. So would they resign?\n\nWhat plans might the Cabinet Secretary Simon Case have to move people about in Whitehall to deal with this scenario?\n\nAnd what happens if Mr Raab is sacked or resigns?\n\nThe question that will immediately be put to the prime minister is why did you appoint this loyal supporter in the first place?\n\nBack in November, Mr Sunak repeatedly declined to tell me whether he had informal warnings about Mr Raab's behaviour before bringing him back into the cabinet.\n\nIn my interview, he said people with concerns should raise them.\n\nShortly afterwards, complaints were made and the independent investigation was set up.\n\nThe prime minister has never given a straight answer to that question of whether he had heard anything informally.\n\nThose around Mr Sunak have long argued that means you have to have proper processes and not make knee-jerk judgements.\n\nThe other question that will be asked is why did it take so long to get to this point?\n\nWhat needs to change about how Westminster works to prevent this happening again?\n\nAnd the prime minister would have to find a new justice secretary, and decide whether he needs another deputy prime minister.\n\nWhatever happens, it looks like an eventful few days ahead at Westminster.", "Diesel prices fell by a record 12p per litre on average in the UK last month, according to the RAC.\n\nPump prices dropped from about \u00a31.59 to \u00a31.47, the group said, cutting the cost of filling up a family car by \u00a36.50.\n\nThe RAC said the reduction was the largest monthly drop it had seen since it began monitoring prices in 2000.\n\nBut the motoring group argued the drop in price was \"both long overdue and smaller than it should be\" due to wholesale prices being lower.\n\nThe British Retail Consortium, which represents supermarkets, said \"big cuts\" had been made to diesel prices in response to falling wholesale costs.\n\nDiesel prices are now down more than 25% from 2022 highs, after falling for seven months in a row.\n\nThe fuel hit a \u00a31.99 per litre high last summer after oil prices soared following Russian's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nPetrol prices have also been falling steadily since then and dropped from \u00a31.46 to \u00a31.43 on average last month, figures from the RAC said.\n\nThe motoring group has suggested that prices have not come down as fast or by as much as they should have, noting that prices were significantly lower in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe RAC said the cut should have been more significant to fully reflect changes in the wholesale market because diesel wholesale costs had been lower than petrol for 10 weeks.\n\nIn May, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) announced it was investigating fuel prices and whether a \"failure in competition\" had meant drivers overpaid.\n\nThe watchdog said it was \"concerned about the sustained higher margins on diesel compared to petrol\" so far this year.\n\nIt said evidence it had gathered so far suggested at least one supermarket had set a higher target for its profit margin on fuel prices in 2022, which could have led rivals to follow suit and raise prices too.\n\nThe RAC said after calling for prices to fall in recent months, it seemed \"ironic that the latest price cuts have finally come in the two weeks following the Competition and Markets Authority's announcement\".\n\n\"What's happened to the price of diesel in May will no doubt give the CMA something to think about,\" Mr Williams said. \"We strongly hope the pump price reductions continue as they should.\"\n\nGordon Balmer, executive director of the Petrol Retailers Association, which represents thousands of independent forecourts, said its advice to drivers was to \"shop around\".\n\n\"As noted by the CMA, petrol and diesel prices are still volatile due to the ongoing war in Ukraine.

Humza Yousaf, Kate Forbes and Ash Regan believe it is possible to achieve independence for Scotland within five years\n\nAll three SNP leadership candidates have predicted that Scotland can be an independent country within five years if they win the contest.\n\nAsh Regan, Humza Yousaf and Kate Forbes were speaking as they faced each other in a BBC Scotland TV debate.\n\nMr Yousaf said he believed the country \"can and will be\" independent by 2028 in response to a question from an audience member.\n\nMs Regan and Ms Forbes both said they believed the same.\n\nThe leadership contest was sparked by Nicola Sturgeon's surprise announcement that she was quitting as both SNP leader and Scotland's first minister after eight years in the roles.\n\nRecent polls have put support for independence at broadly the same level as it was when Ms Sturgeon succeeded Alex Salmond after the referendum in 2014, which saw Scottish voters reject independence by 55% to 45%.\n\nThat is despite the turbulence in UK politics in recent years that saw the country leave the EU despite Scotland voting overwhelmingly in favour of remaining and Boris Johnson's often chaotic time as prime minister.\n\nThe Supreme Court has also ruled that the Scottish Parliament does not have the power to hold a referendum without the agreement of the UK government - which has repeatedly made clear that it has no intention of granting formal consent through a Section 30 order.\n\nMr Yousaf, the health secretary who is the bookies favourite to win the contest and is widely viewed as being Ms Sturgeon's preferred candidate, told the Debate Night Special that he believed he could build sustained majority support for independence that would see those political obstacles disappear.\n\nHe added: \"I would want to be the one who delivers independence, but to do that you've got to stop talking about process and talk about policy.\n\n\"We have got to inspire people with a vision for independence. We have to make sure that we're not obsessing about Section 30s and de facto referendums because people just don't get inspired by that.\"\n\nWho are the SNP candidates?\n\nMs Forbes, the finance secretary who is currently seen as being Mr Yousaf's closest challenger for the leadership, said she believed the dial could be shifted in favour of independence by building a case on the issues that people were concerned about.\n\nUsing the example of the cost of living crisis, she said: \"People can't afford next month's energy bill in a country that is rich in energy in terms of oil and gas and in terms of our renewables. It doesn't stack up because the decisions are being made far, far away from those that are most affected.\n\n\"I think we should be using all democratic opportunities to campaign for and make the case for independence but in a way that is respectful of the reasons why people may not be persuaded\".\n\nMeanwhile, Ms Regan outlined her plans for what she calls a Voter Empowerment Mechanism that \"just uses the ballot box to allow the people of Scotland to say when they are ready to be independent\".\n\nShe added: \"You can use each and every election. So you could start with the next election and then the Scottish election after that. And it's there in the background and then the people of Scotland decide when they're ready to become independent.\"\n\nMs Regan quit as the country's community safety minister over the government's controversial gender recognition plans, and is seen as being the outsider in the contest.\n\nShe clashed with Mr Yousaf - who is the only one of the three to say he would launch a legal challenge to the UK government's block on legislation - over the case of trans rapist Isla Bryson, who was initially sent to a women's prison.\n\nWhen asked by Ms Regan why he had not listened to concerns about cases such as Bryson's ahead of the reforms being passed, and whether he regarded Bryson as a man or as woman, Mr Yousaf said: \"Isla Bryson should not be in a woman's prison.\n\n\"Isla Bryson is a rapist who's completely at it, I don't think they're a genuine trans woman, I think they're trying to play the system.\"\n\nThe three candidates are seeking to succeed Nicola Sturgeon as SNP leader and Scotland's first minister\n\nThe candidates also faced questions on topics including NHS waiting lists - with one audience member saying her husband has chronic health problems and is facing a six-year waiting list - as well as the state of Scotland's education system and the government's controversial Deposit Return Scheme.\n\nMs Regan and Ms Forbes have both said they would pause the scheme, which has faced criticism over its implementation, while Mr Yousaf has pledged to create an exemption for small businesses such as craft brewers.\n\nMs Regan said: \"We can't be putting too many burdens on small businesses. We need to look again at this, we need to involve small business, to come and talk to us about where it needs changed, get it right and then implement it.\"\n\nMs Forbes also said small businesses needed a \"bit of breathing space\".\n\nMr Yousaf said he would not \"slag off\" Lorna Slater, the Scottish Green minister responsible for bringing in the initiative which is designed to boost the recycling of single-use drinks containers by adding 20p to the price which is then refunded when the consumer returns it.\n\nHe said small firms should be excluded from it for its first year but added: \"I can't see any point in pausing the scheme when the big boys, the Coca Colas, the Pepsis of this world, they are already taking part in about 40 DRS schemes across the world. We can't let them off the hook\".\n\nThere was less trashing of one another in this debate and some consensus between the candidates on what the SNP in government has got wrong.\n\nNone of them are happy with the current plans for a deposit return scheme and all three promised to change it in the face of strong criticism from some businesses.\n\nKate Forbes objected to the proposed ban on alcohol advertising and described long waits in the NHS as \"unacceptable\".\n\nHumza Yousaf - the current health secretary - found himself apologising for one patient's experience and offered a \"hands up\" over failures to deliver new ferries on time and on budget.\n\nAsh Regan, who resigned from the Scottish government over gender reform, also called for a review of the SNP's power sharing deal with the Greens.\n\nThe trouble with all this criticism is that all three candidates have served for years in the Scottish government and although Ash Regan has now quit and Kate Forbes has been on maternity leave, they all bear some collective responsibility for its performance.\n\nFor me, one of the stand out moments in this debate was when an audience member called them out on that, arguing that it was \"ridiculous\" that they had not done more before now to challenge mistakes.\n\nVoting in the SNP leadership election, which is using the single transferable vote system, opened on Monday with the winner to be announced on 27 March.\n\nThe SNP has refused to confirm exactly how many party members will be able to take part in the vote, with its Westminster leader Stephen Flynn telling BBC Scotland earlier on Tuesday that he had \"no idea\" and that \"I think the last time I heard it was about 100,000.\"\n\nThe SNP said its membership had reached 125,000 by 2019, but the Electoral Commission put the figure at 104,000 two years later.\n\nThe Mail on Sunday has reported that Southampton-based polling firm Mi-Voice, which is overseeing the leadership vote, has been given the names of just 78,000 members by the SNP.\n\nIf this is correct, it would suggest that the party may have lost nearly 50,000 members over the past four years. The newspaper also reported that Mi-Voice expected about 54,000 members to actually submit a vote.\n\nPolling expert Prof Sir John Curtice has said Mr Yousaf currently appears to be the most popular of the three candidates among the SNP members who will be picking the new leader, with Ms Forbes second and Ms Regan third.\n\nBut Ms Forbes seems to be more popular than her rivals with both SNP voters and the public as a whole, Sir John said.\n\nHe added that it \"looks as though there is plenty to play for\" and that \"maybe everything could turn on the unknown second preferences of Ms Regan's supporters\".\n\nWhoever wins the SNP leadership contest will face a Scottish Parliament vote on 28 March to confirm them as the new first minister, before being sworn into office the following day.", "Ruth Perry was the head at Caversham Primary School in Caversham, Reading\n\nEducation unions have called for Ofsted inspections to be paused in the wake of the death of a head teacher.\n\nRuth Perry, head at Caversham Primary School in Reading, took her own life while waiting for the publication of a report that downgraded her school from outstanding to inadequate.\n\nThe National Education Union, school leaders' union NAHT and the Association of School and College Leaders have called for inspections to be halted.\n\nOfsted has been asked for a comment.\n\nMs Perry's family said the 53-year-old had described the inspection in November as the worst day of her life.\n\nPaul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders' union NAHT, said: \"It is clear that school leaders up and down the country are placed under intolerable pressure by the current approach.\n\n\"It cannot be right that we treat dedicated professions in this way.

I've refused entry. This is an interesting phone call. Doing this for everyone for our school staff everywhere!\"\n\nIn a statement West Berkshire Council later said that following discussions the inspection would go ahead as planned.\n\n\"We understand that the inspection process can be a busy and stressful time for teachers, governors and school staff. As a council, we work closely with all of our schools to support them through the inspection process and address any individual concerns,\" it added.\n\nThe Department for Education said inspections were a \"legal requirement\".\n\nA spokesman said: \"Inspections are hugely important as they hold schools to account for their educational standards and parents greatly rely on the ratings to give them confidence in choosing the right school for their child.\n\n\"We offer our deep condolences to the family and friends of Ruth Perry following her tragic death and are continuing to provide support to Caversham Primary School at this difficult time.\"\n\nThe school inspectors who work for Ofsted have the legal right to enter schools and ask for any documents they wish.\n\nIn theory, under the law, anyone who obstructs them could be fined up to \u00a32,500. But the reality is it would never come to that.\n\nThese are unusual circumstances - a head teacher, grieving for a colleague, who wants to take a stand.\n\nHead teachers describe Ofsted inspections as a process many find almost unbearably stressful, which takes a toll on their mental and physical health.\n\nOfsted has a legal duty to check on the standard of education and welfare of children in school.

Watch: Footage shows the impact of attack on Odesa grain terminals\n\nRussian missile attacks on Ukraine's Black Sea coast have destroyed 60,000 tonnes of grain and damaged storage infrastructure, officials say.\n\nAgriculture Minister Mykola Solskyi said a \"considerable amount\" of export infrastructure was out of operation.\n\nRussia has pulled out of a deal guaranteeing safe passage for exports across the Black Sea.\n\nLater on Wednesday Russia's President Putin accused the West of using the grain deal as \"political blackmail\".\n\nHe added he would consider rejoining the international agreement, in place since last summer, only \"if all principles under which Russia agreed to participate in the deal are fully taken into account and fulfilled\".\n\nHis comments came shortly after Russia's defence ministry declared that from midnight on Wednesday night (21:00 GMT), any ships heading to Ukrainian ports would be viewed as potential carriers of military cargo and party to the conflict.\n\nSome north-western and south-eastern areas of the Black Sea would be temporarily dangerous for shipping, it added.\n\nRussia began targeting Ukraine's ports in the early hours of Tuesday within hours of its withdrawal from the grain deal.\n\nMore strikes followed overnight into Wednesday, targeting grain terminals and port infrastructure in Odesa and further down the Black Sea coast in Chornomorsk, two of the three ports that were included in the export deal.\n\nAt least 12 civilians, including a nine-year-old boy, were wounded during the attacks, which also caused damage to blocks of flats, military officials said.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said each missile strike was a blow not just to Ukraine, but to \"everyone in the world striving for a normal and safe life\".\n\nFrance and Germany also condemned the attack. Germany Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said that by covering Odesa with a hail of bombs, Russian President Vladimir Putin was robbing the world of any hope of Ukrainian grain and \"hitting the world's poorest\".\n\nThe infrastructure ministry published a series of photos showing damage to silos and other grain facilities. Officials said there had been damage to wharves and reservoirs, but it was international and Ukrainian traders that had suffered the most.\n\nRussian war commentators said the damage proved that Kyiv was unable to shoot down the majority of Russian missiles and drones.\n\nOfficials said the co-ordinated attack involved Kalibr cruise missiles, Onyx supersonic and Kh-22 anti-ship missiles as well as kamikaze drones, fired from the Black Sea, Crimea and southern Russia. Although 37 Russian missiles and drones were shot down, a number did penetrate Ukrainian defences, they said.\n\nRussia had called its initial attack on Odesa a \"mass revenge strike\" for an attack on the Russian-built bridge over the Kerch strait linking occupied Crimea to Russia.\n\nSeaborne drones were blamed for Monday's bridge strike that knocked out a section of bridge and killed a Russian couple.\n\nExplosions were reported for several hours from the ammunition depot in Crimea\n\nCrimea saw further disruption on Wednesday. Some 2,200 residents were evacuated from four villages near a military training range after a fire triggered hours of explosions at a nearby ammunition depot.\n\nRussian-installed officials also shut a 12-km (7.5-mile) section of the Tavrida motorway that links the cities of Simferopol and Sevastopol in southern Crimea to the bridge over the Kerch strait. Construction of the road by Russia's occupation authorities began in 2017.\n\nA series of explosions were heard in the area from about 04:30 (01:30 GMT) on Wednesday.\n\nOfficials did not explain the cause of the fire near the city of Staryi Krim. But unconfirmed reports on social media spoke of three Ukrainian strikes.\n\nRussia's appointee boss in Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, said the cause of the fire at the military range was being investigated, but that no-one was hurt.", "Australian mining giant BHP says it underpaid current and former workers across the country for 13 years.\n\nAround 28,500 employees received less holiday than they were entitled to, a review conducted by the firm found.\n\nMeanwhile, 400 workers did not get additional allowances \"due to an error with the employment entity.\"\n\nBHP says it has reported the incident to the authorities and the errors will cost the company up to $280m (\u00a3225m) before taxes.\n\nSome affected employees had their leave incorrectly deducted on Australian public holidays, the company found.

Instead, he'll be presenting the BBC's live coverage of Manchester City v Burnley in the FA Cup on Saturday afternoon.\n\nDame Melanie Dawes, the chief executive of broadcast regulator Ofcom, said the row goes \"straight to the heart\" of the BBC's wider reputation.\n\nBBC executives \"need to be weighing freedom of expression alongside the wide reputation they have for impartiality,\" she told the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee earlier this week.", "Buckingham Palace has declined a request to return the remains of an Ethiopian prince who came to be buried at Windsor Castle in the 19th Century.\n\nPrince Alemayehu was taken to the UK aged just seven and arrived an orphan after his mother died on the journey.\n\nQueen Victoria then took an interest in him and arranged for his education - and ultimately his burial when he died aged just 18.\n\nBut his family wants his remains to be sent back to Ethiopia.\n\n\"We want his remains back as a family and as Ethiopians because that is not the country he was born in,\" one of the royal descendants Fasil Minas told the BBC.\n\n\"It was not right\" for him to be buried in the UK, he added.\n\nBut in a statement sent to the BBC, a Buckingham Palace spokesperson said removing his remains could affect others buried in the catacombs of St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle.\n\n\"It is very unlikely that it would be possible to exhume the remains without disturbing the resting place of a substantial number of others in the vicinity,\" the palace said.\n\nThe statement added that the authorities at the chapel were sensitive to the need to honour Prince Alemayehu's memory, but that they also had \"the responsibility to preserve the dignity of the departed\".\n\nIt also said that in the past the Royal Household had \"accommodated requests from Ethiopian delegations to visit\" the chapel.\n\nHow Prince Alemayehu ended up in the UK at such a young age was the result of imperial action and the failure of diplomacy.\n\nIn 1862, in an effort to strengthen his empire, the prince's father Emperor Tewodros II sought an alliance with the UK, but his letters making his case did not get a response from Queen Victoria.\n\nAngered by the silence and taking matters into his own hands, the emperor held some Europeans, among them the British consul, hostage. This precipitated a huge military expedition, involving some 13,000 British and Indian troops, to rescue them.\n\nThe force also included an official from the British Museum.\n\nIn April 1868 they laid siege to Tewodros' mountain fortress at Maqdala in northern Ethiopia, and in a matter of hours overwhelmed the defences.\n\nThe emperor decided he would rather take his own life than be a prisoner of the British, an action that turned him into a heroic figure among his people.\n\nA 19th Century engraver imagined the scene when the soldiers discovered Emperor Tewodros II's body\n\nAfter the battle, the British plundered thousands of cultural and religious artefacts. These included gold crowns, manuscripts, necklaces and dresses.\n\nHistorians say dozens of elephants and hundreds of mules were needed to cart away the treasures, which are today scattered across European museums and libraries, as well as in private collections.\n\nThe British also took away Prince Alemayehu and his mother, Empress Tiruwork Wube.\n\nThe British may have thought this was to keep them safe and prevent them being captured and possibly killed by Tewodros' enemies, who were near Maqdala, according to Andrew Heavens, whose book The Prince and the Plunder recounts Alemayehu's life.\n\nFollowing his arrival in Britain in June 1868, the prince's predicament and his status as an orphan elicited the sympathy of Queen Victoria. The two met at the queen's holiday home on the Isle of Wight, just off England's south coast.\n\nShe agreed to support him financially and put him in the guardianship of Captain Tristram Charles Sawyer Speedy, the man who had accompanied the prince from Ethiopia.\n\nThey first lived together on the Isle of Wight and then Captain Speedy took him to other parts of the world, including India.\n\nBut it was decided that the prince should have a formal education.\n\nHe was sent to the British public school Rugby but he was not happy there. He later moved to the Royal Military College in Sandhurst where he was subjected to bullying.\n\nThe prince had a \"hankering\" to return home, correspondence quoted by Heavens says, but that idea was swiftly quashed.\n\n\"I feel for him as if I knew him. He was dislocated from Ethiopia, from Africa, from the land of black people and remained there as if he had no home,\" Ethiopian royal descendent Abebech Kasa told the BBC.\n\nEventually, Alemayehu ended up being tutored in a private home in Leeds. But he became ill, possibly with pneumonia, and at one point refused treatment thinking he had been poisoned.\n\nAfter a decade in exile the prince died in 1879 at the age of just 18.\n\nHis illness had become the subject of articles in the national press and Queen Victoria wrote in her diary of her sadness at his death.\n\n\"Very grieved and shocked to hear by telegram, that good Alemayehu had passed away this morning. It is too sad! All alone, in a strange country, without a single person or relative, belonging to him,\" she said.\n\n\"His was no happy life, full of difficulties of every kind, and was so sensitive, thinking that people stared at him on account of his colour... Everyone is very sorry.\"\n\nShe then arranged for his burial at Windsor Castle.\n\nThere are several photographs of Prince Alemayehu including this where he is wearing a hat with the name of the ship, HMS Urgent\n\nDemands that the body should return are not new.\n\nIn 2007 the country's then-President Girma Wolde-Giorgis sent a formal request to Queen Elizabeth II for the body to be sent back, but those efforts proved fruitless.\n\n\"We want him back. We don't want him to remain in a foreign country,\" Ms Abebech said.\n\n\"He had a sad life. When I think of him I cry. If they agree to return his remains I would think of it as if he came home alive.\"\n\nShe had hoped that she would get a positive response from newly crowned King Charles III.\n\n\"Restitution is used as a way to bring reconciliation, to recognise what was wrong in the past,\" says Professor Alula Pankhurst, a specialist in British-Ethiopian relations.\n\nHe believes the return of the body would be \"a way for Britain to rethink its past. It's a reflection and coming to terms with an imperial past.\"\n\nWatch more on this story:\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Family calls for return of Ethiopian prince's body from UK", "The United States has designated journalist Evan Gershkovich as being \"wrongfully detained\" by Russia and called for his immediate release.\n\nMr Gershkovich, an experienced Russia reporter, was arrested last month in the city of Yekaterinburg while working for the Wall Street Journal (WSJ).\n\nHe has since been formally charged with spying, but the WSJ denies this.\n\nIt is the first time Moscow has accused a US journalist of espionage since the Soviet era.\n\nThe \"wrongfully detained\" designation in the US means the case will now be transferred to the office of the Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs. This will raise the profile of the case and allow the government to allocate more resources to securing his release.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken \"made a determination that Evan Gershkovich is wrongfully detained by Russia\", state department spokesman Vedant Patel said.\n\nHe called for the \"immediate release\" of Mr Gershkovich and condemned \"the Kremlin's continued repression of independent voices in Russia, and its ongoing war against the truth.\"\n\nThe WSJ said: \"The distinction will unlock additional resources and attention at the highest levels of the US government in securing his release.\"\n\n\"We are doing everything in our power to support Evan and his family,\" it added.\n\nRussia has not granted US consular officials access to Mr Gershkovich, which is in violation of international law, Mr Patel told reporters earlier on Monday.\n\nLast week the Russian foreign ministry said the issue of consular access was being resolved but added that the \"fuss in the US about this case, which was aimed at pressurising the Russian authorities... was hopeless and senseless\".\n\nMr Gershkovich, 31, is well known among foreign correspondents in Moscow. BBC Russia Editor Steve Rosenberg describes him as an excellent reporter and a highly principled journalist.\n\nThe WSJ said its reporter had dropped out of contact with his editors on 28 March while in Yekaterinberg.\n\nRussia's FSB security service said it had halted \"illegal activities\" by detaining the journalist.\n\nPress freedom watchdog Reporters Without Borders said he had gone to Yekaterinburg to cover Russian mercenary group Wagner, which has taken part in some of the heaviest fighting in eastern Ukraine.\n\nAccording to a report by the James Foley Legacy Foundation, which advocates for the freedom of Americans being held hostage abroad, at least 65 Americans were being unfairly detained abroad in 2022.\n\nThe foundation is named after a US journalist abducted in Syria and killed by the Islamic State group in 2014.", "Wagner fighters managed to take control over Rostov-on-Don - a Russian city - during their short-lived mutiny\n\nWagner mercenary group head Yevgeniy Prigozhin has rejected an offer to his fighters to serve as a unit in Russia's army, President Vladimir Putin says.\n\nHe told Kommersant newspaper that many group commanders had backed the plan to be led by a senior Wagner figure during recent talks in Moscow.\n\nHe said Prigozhin's reply was \"the guys do not agree with this decision\".\n\nThe talks were held just days after Wagner's aborted mutiny on 23-24 June that challenged Mr Putin's authority.\n\nUnder the deal that ended the short-lived rebellion, the mercenaries were told they could join the regular Russian army or head to Belarus, a close ally of Russia.\n\nWagner has fought some of the bloodiest battles since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nHowever, the US military now assesses that the group is no longer \"participating in any significant capacity in support of combat operations in Ukraine\".\n\nThe comments were made on Thursday by Pentagon spokesman Pat Ryder, who also said that \"the majority\" of Wagner fighters were believed to still be in areas of Russian-occupied Ukraine.\n\nIn a separate development, Belarus' defence ministry said on Friday that Wagner fighters were now acting as military instructors for the country's territorial defence forces.\n\nThe ministry said the fighters were training Belarusian forces \"in a number of military disciplines\" near the town of Osipovichy, about 85km (53 miles) south-east of the capital Minsk.\n\nIn Thursday's interview with Kommersant business daily, President Putin said that 35 Wagner commanders, including Prigozhin, had been present at the Kremlin meeting on 29 June.\n\nMr Putin said he had offered them several \"employment options\", including continued service under the command of a senior Wagner commander known by his nom de guerre Sedoi - Grey Hair.\n\n\"Many [Wagner fighters] were nodding when I was saying this,\" Mr Putin said.\n\n\"And Prigozhin, who was sitting in front and didn't see all this, said after listening: 'No, the guys do not agree with this decision,'\" the president added.\n\nHe also said that \"Wagner does not exist\" when asked whether the group would be preserved as a fighting unit. \"There is no law on private military organisations. It just doesn't exist.\"\n\nThis \"difficult issue\" of how to legalise Wagner fighters should be discussed in parliament, Mr Putin suggested.\n\nThe Kremlin appears to want to differentiate between the Wagner chief and regular Wagner fighters, driving a wedge between them, says the BBC's Russia editor Steve Rosenberg in Moscow.\n\nHe adds that this would explain the attempts in Russia's state media to discredit Prigozhin.\n\nThe current whereabouts of Prigozhin, a former Putin loyalist, are unknown.\n\nAlso on Thursday, US President Joe Biden said Prigozhin should be careful of poisoning following the mutiny.\n\n\"God only knows what he's likely to do. We're not even sure where he is and what relationship he has [with Mr Putin]. If I were he, I'd be careful what I ate.

But I can't predict exactly how that happens.\"\n\nHe also expressed the \"hope and expectation\" that Ukraine would make enough progress in its current counter-offensive for there to be a negotiated peace settlement.\n\nBut more than a month into the long-planned Ukrainian counter-offensive, some Ukrainians and their allies are expressing concerns over the slow progress of Kyiv's troops.\n\nOthers believe that Russia's defences will eventually shatter, allowing Ukraine to seize strategically significant territory and to advance towards Crimea, Ukraine's southern peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

I didn't see behaviour like that myself, although I was in a different force.\n\n\"But I know [Chief Constable] Pam Kelly well, and I know that she will be absolutely appalled by the alleged behaviour and she will be fully investigating. In fact she's confirmed that she's doing so and rightly so.\"\n\nDavid TC Davies says he is \"appalled\" over the allegations against some Gwent Police officers\n\nMr Davies added that \"there are individuals letting the force down\" and \"the majority of police officers do a very good job in difficult circumstances, and are as angry as we are\".\n\nThe Sunday Times report revealed messages including jokes between serving and retired officers about sexual predator Jimmy Savile; a video of a woman stripping; leaked nude images; and an officer saying a colleague carried a \"sex kit\" in the boot of his car.\n\nIn one message, a retired officer reportedly referred to a female officer and said: \"I actually got her to lift her skirt in Cardiff once.\"\n\nRuth Jones, Labour MP for Newport West, said the situation \"continued to appal\".\n\nShe added: \"We need to be able to trust officers to police fairly and without discrimination, and at the moment we're in real danger of trust being irrevocably lost between the public and police force.\"\n\nMs Jones added that the force had \"serious questions to answer\" and supported calls for a national inquiry.\n\n\"We need to leave no stone left unturned,\" she said.\n\nNewport West MP Ruth Jones says Gwent Police \"cannot afford to let the public trust be broken in this way\".\n\nChief Constable Pam Kelly said: \"The initial complaint raised by the Jones family did not include the conduct matters now emerging and, as new issues come to light, we will continue to take swift and robust action.\"\n\nShe said the force \"will not tolerate\" such behaviour, adding: \"We continue to be horrified by the comments and material shared by retired officers and a small number of serving officers.\n\n\"These behaviours and attitudes have no place in Gwent Police and we will continue our ongoing work with our colleagues to set out clear expectations around the standards that both we and the public expect.\"\n\nThe Police Federation of Wales and England admitted the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IPOC) investigation could be \"horrendously slow\".\n\nBut Nicky Ryan, the federation's Welsh lead told Radio Wales Breakfast: \"It must be done expeditiously.

During last month's strike, hospitals drafted in consultants to provide cover but it is estimated a quarter of them are on leave due to the Easter holidays.\n\n\"With the junior doctors out for the four days, but those four days being bookmarked either side by the Easter weekend and another weekend, the disruption is going to go on for 10 or 11 days,\" said Dr McCay.\n\n\"What we expect to see is really significant diminished capacity within the health service.\"\n\nOn health leaders' fears about the strikes, she added: \"They think the impact is going to be so significant that this one is likely to have impact on patient safety, and that is a huge concern for every healthcare leader.\"\n\nPostponements are likely so that hospitals can focus on the most urgent and life-threatening cases, said Dr McCay.\n\nHealth Secretary Steve Barclay has been urged to meet union representatives over the bank holiday weekend to try to resolve the issue.\n\nDr Vivek Trivedi, co-director of the junior doctors' committee at the BMA, said they want to be sure Mr Barclay \"is serious about pay erosion\" - but added he is yet to put a credible offer on the table.\n\n\"All we're asking for is a credible offer that shows us he's serious, that we can start a path of negotiations to try to address the real-terms pay cut,\" he said.\n\nThe Department of Health and Social Care has said the BMA has to call off the strike for any negotiations to take place.\n\nIt says the government is working with NHS England to put contingency plans in place to protect patient safety during the strike.\n\n\"The NHS will prioritise resources to protect emergency treatment, critical care, maternity and neonatal care, and trauma,\" a spokesman said.\n\nAre you a junior doctor with a view on the strike?

But the RPI index, another measure of inflation stood at 11.4% in the year to April.\n\nThe strikes will affect Terminals 3 and 5, and have an impact on airport crew checks.

Ukraine's advance in southern Donetsk has stuttered, but continues.\n\nThe BBC joined the 68th Jaeger Brigade as its combat forces sought to expand their control eastward of the recently regained village of Blahodatne.\n\nIn their sights were a series of trenches protecting Russian forces on nearby hilltops.\n\nThe men of a specialised drone unit grab cameras, roll cables and load a pickup truck with tins of ammunition, crates of smoke grenades and armour-piercing rounds.\n\nAside from them, there's little sign of life in Blahodatne. Down a lane, the wreckage of two heavily armoured American-made MRAP vehicles lie stranded, one a burnt-out shell. There are more of these mine-resistant vehicles disabled in the fields beyond.\n\n\"Steer clear of those, the Russians keep hitting them,\" we are warned. Russia has made much of the losses of Western-donated tanks and vehicles, even as Vladimir Putin admitted it has lost dozens of tanks since the counter-offensive began on 5 June.\n\nTroops are attacking at three points: Bakhmut, where they are advancing north and south of the city, which remains firmly under Russian control; south of Zaporizhzhia; and in southern Donetsk, where a number of villages have been taken back.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: Yaroslav starts talking about the frequency of Russian fire and is interrupted by a blast\n\nBlahodatne is one of those. Another salvo comes in and the soldiers take cover in the cellar of a ruined house.\n\nA dirt floor passageway is lit with oil lamps, casting soft yellow light down its length to a stone and iron stove with three sturdy pots atop. Towels hang from a washing line. A rough wooden door opens and, in a headscarf, Nina Fedorivna emerges.\n\nShe has been living down here for the past year. Russian soldiers came by only once, she says.\n\nShe never, for a second, considered leaving the village.\n\nThe artillery barrage over, we leave through a lane at the end of her house. Three Russian corpses lie in a ditch, just beyond Nina Fedorivna's vegetable patch. A truck with the Z symbol, which was used by Russian forces, sits nearby riddled with bullet and shrapnel holes. The fighting here was at close quarters.\n\nThroughout the village roses are in bloom - but the smell of corpses catches the back of your throat.\n\nThere's no time to delay - the soldiers have an air of concentration and purpose. They are clearly preparing for something.\n\nThey head east, leaving Blahodatne behind. The two-car convoy is well spaced in case of Russian attack. The fields around are heavily mined, poles with red-and-white ribbon mark cleared ground.\n\nAs we get close to another abandoned American armoured vehicle, there's an explosion, just missing the wreckage. It is likely from a Russian drone.\n\nI was in this area back in March. Then, the front lines had barely moved a few metres in months. Russia was using far more artillery than Ukrainian forces, who mainly hunkered down in trenches waiting for the barrages to end. At the time, a commander told me they were conserving their shells for the counter-offensive. On this visit, Ukrainian guns didn't stop for the two days I was with the brigade.\n\nThe cars speed on to a network of trenches hidden in a line of trees. There, company commander, Senior Sergeant Andrii Onistrat, 49, runs his men through their next mission - a Ukrainian assault is planned for the next day on the Russian trenches, 3km (1.8 miles) away at the foot of the low hills to the south.\n\nIn their attempt to widen the front, sections of the 68th Brigade will attack from the countryside east of Blahodatne and Makarivka, across minefields and directly in the line of Russian fire.\n\nSgt Onistrat runs through the drone team's communication protocols and targets. The section loses as many as five drones a day. Tanned and with a brilliant white grin, he looks at his grim-faced men and gives one final order: \"Smile - why are you so serious? We are winning the war.\"\n\nSmile, why are you so serious? We are winning the war\n\nTwenty-four hours later, most of the same men are in a sweltering dugout. The attack is under way.\n\nFrom their surveillance cameras I can see two armoured vehicles slowly making their way through the minefield. Drone after drone is sent above the Russian positions dropping smoke grenades, creating a smoke screen along the Russian-occupied trenches to allow vehicles to advance and confuse enemy anti-tank weapons. As I watch, Ukrainian shells repeatedly strike the treeline.\n\nYuri, a young soldier, runs in and out of the dugout, changing drone batteries and sending them into flight, while voices bark orders and target positions across the radios. Mosquitoes and horseflies are feasting on the men, but still \"Frisbee\", from western Ukraine, has taken his shirt off because of the heat.\n\nTheir enemy isn't holding back. As I stand outside, a Russian strike lands close enough to throw dirt into the trench. Standing lookout in wrap-around shades and without body armour is Zheka.\n\nAnother Russian shell lands close and I hit the ground. I look up and Zheka hasn't flinched. He shouts in English - expletives directed at the Russians - and gives two middle fingers to the air. Salvoes of Grad rockets rain down on Ukrainian positions.\n\nUkrainian forces launch drones to drop smoke grenades near the Russian positions\n\nMore broadly, the counter-offensive is made more difficult because of the lack of Ukrainian air power. The West has promised F-16 fighter planes, but they will not arrive until later this year.\n\nBack outside in the trenches, another soldier, Yaroslav, explains: \"Russian helicopters, Russians jets fire at every area, every day\". He's interrupted as another strike lands nearby. \"Go to the shelter, good luck,\" he says.\n\nWhen, on 3 June, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that Ukraine was ready for the counter-offensive, he mentioned Russian air superiority and warned many Ukrainian lives would be lost. And so it has been for the 68th Brigade.\n\nSgt Onistrat says this weighs heavily on him. \"The severity of the day depends solely on one thing - the number of people we lose. The last week has been extremely difficult. We have lost a large number of people.\"\n\nOn his head he wears a ballistic helmet, a size too small. I mention it and he starts to weep. \"It was my son's,\" he says.\n\nOstap Onistrat, 21, was killed in a drone strike not far from where we speak, a couple of days before the counter-offensive began. He'd been in the army a year.\n\nHis father is still in the throes of grief. \"A kamikaze drone flew to them and in fact hit him directly. It was impossible to recognise him. He was buried in a closed coffin,\" Sgt Onistrat says.\n\nSgt Onistrat lost his son Ostap (right) just days before the counter-offensive began\n\nHow does he go on, I ask. \"I made a commitment. You know, we're here to win. Not to sit back, not to escape. I just think that every person here must do their job professionally. There is nothing heroic in it. I just have to finish this job.\"\n\nWhen I ask if he's looking for revenge, he replies firmly: \"Revenge is a sin.\n\n\"My task is to bring this story to an end. I want to take part in the victory parade. I want us to win, and I want to lose fewer people.\"\n\nWe leave the front, the offensive still under way. Later, I received a message telling me they'd taken the Russian positions.\n\nReturning to the command post, Sgt Onistrat's car escorting us swerves and comes to a sudden stop. He, along with others, quickly exits the vehicle. I wonder if we too need to take cover.\n\nThen I see what's caught their attention - cherry trees.\n\nLike kids, they laugh carefree for a moment as they grab handfuls of the dark red fruit from the shady branches, as artillery and mortar fire continues to hammer Russian positions on the hillside.", "It was delivered by Suella Braverman, but this was unmistakeably Rishi Sunak's own policy.\n\nThe prime minister has made \"passing new laws to stop the small boats\" one of his five priorities.\n\nHe was conspicuously seated behind his home secretary, visible in the TV coverage, nodding, smiling and voicing his assent at key points as she outlined the new legislation.\n\nDelivering the new law is part of his plan to try to turn around the Conservatives' flagging poll ratings before the next election.\n\nMs Braverman spoke of her approach being \"supported by the British people\" and she made a point of warning of 100 million people \"who could qualify for protection under our current laws... they are coming here\" aiming to tap into fears about growing numbers of arrivals.\n\nSo the legislation may be, on the face of it, about stopping boats, it's also squarely aimed at galvanising political support at home.\n\nThe debate was a divisive one, short on any details about the how this new policy is actually going to work.\n\nOne after another, opposition MPs stood up to criticise the plan as a policy \"that depends on dehumanising some of the most vulnerable people on earth\", one based on \"xenophobia and racism\" and one that may breach the UK's international legal obligations.\n\nSuella Braverman appeared content to portray herself as someone prepared to take robust action. It was, she said, \"irresponsible to suggest someone who wants to take a firm line on our borders is racist\".\n\nOne after another Conservative MPs rose to praise her approach as \"excellent\".\n\nBut she couldn't say whether the legislation in fact complies with human rights law, where holding centres will be built, what 'safe' countries refugees could be deported to, or what routes will be opened for people to come legally to the UK.\n\nIn a letter to MPs about the bill, Ms Braverman said there was a \"more than 50% chance\" that the legislation was not compatible with international law, and specifically the UK's obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nIt's pretty rare for the government to publish legislation that it knows may breach international law.

Labour's Yvette Cooper launched into her attack on the new legislation saying it does little different to that passed by Priti Patel a year ago and that hasn't solved the problem, rather made it worse.\n\nLabour wants to portray the government as ineffective. Its plan is to call for more serious cross-border police action and says the government is stirring up this issue to \"have someone else to blame.\"\n\nThe prepared retort from Ms Braverman was that Labour's leader Sir Keir Starmer \"doesn't want to stop the boats\".\n\nThe issue didn't figure in his \"missions\" for his leadership, she said, seeking to draw a contrast with Mr Sunak.\n\nThe new policy is already being put to work to try to frame people's views of the government and its opponents.\n\nSo already in this first debate you could see how the government hopes to exploit the issue politically, using it to try to frame people's views of Mr Sunak and his opponents.", "Former Scottish health secretary Jeane Freeman has given evidence to the UK Covid inquiry\n\nThere was no plan which could have adequately prepared Scotland for the coronavirus pandemic, former health secretary Jeane Freeman has said.\n\nShe told the UK Covid Inquiry that health infrastructure was not equipped to handle the crisis and that PPE supplies came close to running out.\n\nThe ex-minister also said some guidance on flu outbreaks had not been acted upon by the time the pandemic began.\n\nThe inquiry will hear from former first minister Nicola Sturgeon on Thursday.\n\nCounsel to the inquiry, Kate Blackwell KC, pointed to a 2021 Audit Scotland report that found the government was inadequately prepared for the crisis and had failed to implemented recommendations from three pandemic planning exercises in 2015, 2016 and 2018.\n\nMs Freeman, who was the Scottish health secretary from 2018 to 2021, said: \"There were certainly areas where Scotland could have been better prepared in terms of the underlying structure and delivery of all those recommendations.\n\n\"But Scotland, like other countries throughout the world, was dealing with a virus which was unknown and new.\n\n\"So in that sense, I don't believe there is a plan that would have been possible that would have been able, in and of itself, to cope with Covid-19.\"\n\nThe UK Covid inquiry is currently examining preparedness for the pandemic\n\nThe Audit Scotland report found that Scotland's PPE stockpile was not sufficient to meet the demands of the NHS in early 2020.\n\nThe inquiry heard that the issue of stockpiling, providing and fit testing PPE had been raised in three consecutive exercises, but that the Scottish government had not acted on recommendations.\n\nMs Freeman \u2013 whose video-link testimony was repeatedly interrupted due to a poor internet connection \u2013 said the country had not run out of PPE, but there had \"clearly\" been persistent issues with distributing equipment to frontline staff.\n\n\"There was sufficient PPE at the start of the pandemic,\" she told the inquiry.\n\n\"Obviously there were serious challenges throughout that and although it's fair to say we came close on some occasions, we did not run out of PPE in Scotland.\"\n\nMs Freeman said there was no \"specific plan\" to respond to any other pathogen than influenza in Scotland.\n\n\"There was certainly an understanding of different pathogens, but Covid-19 was a novel virus so its exact characteristics and how it would perform and transmit was unknown internationally and so information and clinical assessment of that was being updated regularly,\" she told the inquiry.\n\nMs Freeman said that Covid-19 has exacerbated existing operational issues in Scottish NHS - but added the health service performance was also affected by UK government spending decisions.\n\nShe said Downing Street's austerity policies had a direct impact on the Scottish government, which is unable to borrow money or overspend its budget.\n\n\"Notwithstanding that the health budget and the budget for social care had increased year on year but not necessarily increased sufficiently to meet with additional demands but also with other cost pressures around pharmacy, inflation and so on.\"\n\nThe inquiry is also due to hear from Scotland's former chief medical officer, Dr Catherine Calderwood\n\nIt came after a senior civil servant said planning for a potential no-deal Brexit had hampered Scotland's preparation for a pandemic.\n\nThe inquiry heard that work to enact recommendations made as a result of national resilience exercises, Silver Swan in 2015 and Cygnus in 2016, remained incomplete.\n\nGillian Russell, the Scottish government's director for safer communities from 2015 to 2020 and the current health workforce director, said resilience work was put on hold in October 2018 for Operation Yellowhammer \u2013 the UK government code name for preparations to deal with a chaotic no-deal exit from the EU.\n\nShe described the Brexit planning as \"very, very significantly challenging\" for civil servants.\n\nMs Russell told the inquiry: \"A decision was taken that priority should be given to working through how we would mitigate the very significant risks that immediately crystallised on a no-deal Brexit.\"\n\nShe said some work, including around communication strategies and resilience partnerships was completed on schedule, but that much of it was side-tracked due to Brexit planning.\n\n\"That took up a huge amount of strategic capacity across many parts of Scottish government, including the resilience co-ordination of a lot of that work,\" the civil servant said.\n\nThe inquiry also heard that the Scottish government Pandemic Flu Preparedness Board, set up in 2017, had met every two months until November 2018.\n\nHowever, meetings became \"much more sporadic\" due to Yellowhammer, Ms Russell said. The board did not meet between November 2018 and June 2019, with only one further meeting taking place before the Covid crisis hit the UK in early 2020.\n\nOn Tuesday, former UK health secretary Matt Hancock told the inquiry that medicines for intensive care were \"within hours\" of running out at the peak of the pandemic - but said the only reason they did not run out was because of work done in 2019 in preparation for a no-deal Brexit.\n\nMr Hancock said civil service staff were moved off pandemic preparedness and onto Brexit but insisted, as a result, they \"we were better prepared in terms of supply chains\".\n\nHe added: \"Who knows the overall impact and which of those balances in the scales is greater?

It is a key demand from Kyiv that President Zelensky reiterated: \"There can be no peace at the expense of territorial compromises.\"\n\nCritics have also questioned the idea of Beijing acting as a mediator, citing not only Mr Xi's firm friendship with Russia's leader but also China's soaring trade with Russia and its refusal even to speak of an \"invasion\".\n\nRussian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Moscow saw \"broad concord\" with China's approach but said the main barrier was Kyiv's \"unrealistic demands\". Moscow's own demands include recognition of its annexation of swathes of Ukrainian territory, including Crimea, which was invaded in 2014.\n\nChina's 12-point plan to end the war has been widely criticised by Ukraine and the West. It fails to offer clear plans for Ukraine's future security or for territory seized by Russia and includes a proposal for unilateral sanctions to be dropped.\n\nAnd yet Wednesday's hour-long call did not come as a complete surprise.\n\nEarlier this month, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said that Mr Xi had spoken of his willingness to talk to Ukraine's leader when the \"conditions and time are right\". She had joined French President Emmanuel Macron on a visit to Beijing.\n\nPresident Zelensky has repeatedly reached out to the Chinese president, an acknowledgement that China's vast wealth and global influence could swing the outcome of the war.\n\nIn its readout of the call, Beijing announced its willingness to engage directly with Ukraine, by sending a special representative on Eurasian affairs to Kyiv and other capitals for \"in-depth communication\" on a political settlement.\n\nFor his part, Mr Zelensky appointed a former minister, Pavlo Ryabikin, as ambassador to Beijing.\n\nXi Jinping has had recent diplomatic success by persuading Iran and Saudi Arabia to restore ties. While it is possible he may have developed a taste for the role of a key international stakeholder, there may also be an economic element to his intervention.\n\nChina's flagging economy is still fragile after years of tight Covid-19 restrictions. It is dependent on export trade and cannot fully bounce back as the war in Ukraine drags on.\n\nNews of the phone-call made headline news in China's carefully controlled state media outlets, which printed China's interpretation of the call.\n\nOn Chinese social media sites, users appeared supportive, with many calling for peaceful dialogue and supporting what they saw as China acting like a responsible country.\n\n\"China must break the deadlock and melt the ice!\" read one typical comment.\n\u2022 None End of Ukraine war no closer after Putin-Xi talks", "Consultants in England want at least three times their basic pay to provide emergency cover for junior doctors during this month's three-day walkout.\n\nThe demands have been described as unreasonable by NHS bosses as they try to plug the gaps in emergency care.\n\nThe British Medical Association (BMA) is recommending its members ask for \u00a3158 an hour to work during the day, rising to \u00a3262 for night shifts.\n\nIt said it was right to be paid more for work outside the normal contract.\n\nConsultants earn between \u00a388,000 and \u00a3119,000 a year in basic pay - that works out at the equivalent of about \u00a342 to \u00a357 an hour in a 40-hour week.\n\nAlthough average pay is \u00a320,000 higher once extra payments for performance, night shifts and being on call is included.\n\nBut during the strike the BMA has advised doctors to ask for:\n\nThe BMA said the pay rates should be used by any consultant who is asked to move from their normal speciality or by emergency care consultants who are asked to do extra shifts or fulfil roles normally done by junior doctors.\n\nAbout 40% of the medical workforce is classed as a junior doctor and two-thirds are thought to be BMA members who will be asked to walk out between 06:00 GMT on 13 and 06:00 on 16 March across both planned and emergency care in their pay dispute.\n\nJunior doctors are calling for pay rises to make up for cuts of 26% since 2008.\n\nDanny Mortimer, the chief executive of NHS Employers, said health bosses had sympathy for the plight of doctors, but that was being \"eroded\" by the unilateral demands being made for premium pay.\n\nHe said NHS bosses had not been consulted on the rates, which are included in the BMA official rate card used for extra hours beyond contracted work.\n\n\"If their dispute is with the government with regards to both pay and pensions, it seems unreasonable to act without first seeking any kind of agreement with employers,\" he added.\n\nThe rate card was first introduced last year, the BMA said, after some NHS trusts tried to cap the amount they were willing to pay for overtime.\n\nBMA consultants leader Dr Vishal Sharma said it was right the rate card was used for the strikes.\n\n\"We wholeheartedly support and stand in solidarity with our junior doctor colleagues in their industrial action and pursuit of full pay restoration.\n\n\"Consultants, having themselves experienced real-terms pay cuts, know all too well the damaging impact pay erosion has on morale and staff retention.\n\n\"On strike days it is the responsibility of employers to ensure that services are staffed safely, and they have been given adequate notice of when the action is set to take place.\n\n\"The BMA rate card rates are recommended for all work undertaken outside of the normal contract, and they are therefore appropriate to use for covering absent junior doctors as this work is quite clearly extra-contractual.\n\n\"These rates therefore reflect the market value of doctors' work.\"", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Wildland Limited, Forestry and Land Scotland, RSPB Scotland and NatureScot - working towards a 200-year vision to enhance habitat, species and ecological processes.\n\nAs many as 20 wildcats a year could be released into the wild\n\nNatureScot's head of biodiversity, Dr Katherine Leys, said Saving Wildcats offered a lifeline for the species.\n\nShe said: \"This journey is not without difficulty, and we know that there are more hurdles to overcome before we reach the point where we are ready to release the wildcats into carefully selected areas of the Cairngorms National Park.\n\n\"Once there, the wildcats will face further challenges, so it's crucial the project continues to work with local communities, farmers, land-owners and cat owners to ensure wildcats are given the best chance to survive and thrive.\"\n\nSaving Wildcats project lead and Royal Zoological Society of Scotland's head of conservation, Dr Helen Senn, said: \"When the time comes, we will be able to move wildcats under licence from pre-release enclosures at Highland Wildlife Park to carefully selected areas in the Cairngorms Connect landscape which provide a suitable mix of habitats and potential prey for the species.\n\n\"After release, the wildcats will be monitored using GPS collars as they face the many challenges of life in the wild.\"\n\nShe added: \"The fight to restore Scotland's wildcat populations is just beginning and we are grateful to everyone providing expertise and support along the way.\"\n\nA breeding centre is to be created at the Highland Wildlife Park near Aviemore in the Cairngorms\n\nWildland Limited is a company owned by Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen and his wife Anne.\n\nDirector of conservation Thomas MacDonell said the company was delighted to be part of the effort to restore wildcats.\n\nFarming union, NFU Scotland, said NatureScot's approval of a licence was \"fantastic news\".\n\nPolicy manager Penny Middleton said: \"As a supporter of the official body, the Scottish Wildcat Action forum, we have previously helped disseminate information on how to protect this iconic native species to our members in the priority areas identified for wildcats, including the Cairngorms National Park area.\n\n\"We recognise that the species remains critically endangered and that the plans through the Saving Wildcats project to preserve the species are starting to come to fruition.\"\n\nShe added: \"The farming community in release areas will be keen to support these plans and identify how they can assist.\"", "The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has been one of the most vocal critics of the Illegal Migration Bill\n\nThe House of Lords has voted to back an attempt to force the government to produce a 10-year strategy on refugees and trafficking, as part of its migration bill.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury led the move to include the strategy in the government's flagship legislation to stop small boat crossings to the UK.\n\nJustin Welby insisted the strategy would improve and not damage the bill.\n\nPeers have voted to approve multiple changes to the bill in the Lords.\n\nBut ministers are expected to ask MPs to overturn the changes when the legislation returns to the House of Commons, where the Conservative government has a majority.\n\nThe bill is central to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's high-profile pledge to \"stop\" small boats crossing the English Channel - one of his five key pledges.\n\nThe number of migrants crossing from France set a record for June, pushing the total for the year above 11,000.\n\nEarlier, Mr Sunak's spokesman said the government would press ahead with its Illegal Migration Bill, despite the string of defeats it has suffered in the Lords.\n\nMr Welby has been one of the most vocal critics of the bill, previously condemning the legislation as \"morally unacceptable\" and \"politically impractical\".\n\nAs peers debated the bill on Wednesday, Mr Welby tabled two amendments which would require the government to have a 10-year strategy for collaborating internationally to tackle refugee crises and human trafficking.\n\nSpeaking in the Lords, Mr Welby said the amendment was \"intended to be helpful\" and mitigate \"some of the concerns about a lack of a global and long-term perspective on the issues\".\n\n\"I urge the government to develop a strategy that is ambitious, collaborative and worthy of our history and up to the scale of the enormous challenges that we face,\" Mr Welby said.\n\nPeers inflicted further defeats on the government as they debated and voted on detailed changes to the bill. There will be a further day of debate in the Lords before it returns to the Commons.\n\nOne amendment would make it a legal duty for ministers to create safe and legal routes to the UK for refugees by next spring. Two others reinstate and expand a right of appeal against age assessments for migrants claiming to be children.\n\nAhead of Wednesday's debate, the Archbishops of Canterbury and York urged ministers to back changes to the legislation to ensure a \"just\" and \"compassionate\" asylum policy.\n\nIn a letter to The Times signed by eight other faith leaders, the two archbishops warned the legislation \"falls short of our obligation to the most vulnerable\".\n\nThe prime minister's official spokesman said he was not going to respond to individual opinions.\n\nBut, he added, Mr Sunak was \"clear that stopping the boats, stopping the cruel cycle of vulnerable people being exploited by criminal gangs, is the fair and compassionate thing to do\".\n\nIf passed, the bill would place a legal duty on the government to detain and remove migrants arriving in the UK illegally, either to Rwanda or another \"safe\" third country.\n\nThe government has stressed it remains committed to its plan to remove migrants to Rwanda, and has said it will challenge a Court of Appeal ruling last week that this was unlawful.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr Sunak told the Liaison Committee of senior MPs the government's case would be made in the Supreme Court \"confidently and vigorously\".\n\nIn the first six months of 2023, 11,434 people were detected making the journey from France, according to provisional Home Office figures.\n\nThe June total of 3,824 was the highest since records began in 2018. In June last year, 3,140 migrants arrived in the UK after crossing the Channel.\n\nDespite the record June number, the total for the first half of the year was 10% lower than for January-June 2022 (12,747).\n\nIn January, Mr Sunak set out five pledges which he said would address \"the people's priorities\", including passing new laws to stop Channel crossings. But he did not put a timescale on achieving the promise.\n\nLast month, he insisted his plan was \"starting to work\".\n\nLabour has accused the prime minister of chasing \"short-term headlines instead of doing the hard work needed to tackle the problem\".\n\nShadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: \"The numbers of dangerous crossings are rising again, hotel costs are spiralling, all while the government's flagship Rwanda policy unravels in front of their eyes.\"\n\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.", "\"You get very good at lying,\" David tells me.\n\n\"Getting loans for home improvements that weren't for home improvements. Credit cards. Any way I could get money to gamble.\"\n\nA transport worker from the north of England, David doesn't want to reveal his real name.\n\nHis gambling addiction has cost him his marriage, and many thousands of pounds. \"It's just a double life,\" he says, \"I've lost enough for a house.\n\n\"I was using online casinos, roulette machines, slot machines online. It was always on my phone. I was betting on football live, on horseracing, anything. It could be any time of day.\"\n\nNow in his 30s, David is getting help and has managed to make it just past 100 days without a bet.\n\nWith the government about to announce its planned reforms to gambling laws in Great Britain (it is a devolved matter in Northern Ireland), David wants affordability checks on punters to make sure they have the money to lose.\n\n\"I only got asked if I could afford it after I'd spent thousands of pounds,\" he says. \"I just went to another company and opened another account.\"\n\nThe government is expected to tighten regulation on the sector when it publishes its white paper on gambling in the coming weeks\n\nIntense lobbying behind the scenes has gone on in recent months, to shape what will be the first significant piece of legislation on gambling in nearly 20 years and since the invention of smartphones.\n\nThis white paper has already been pushed back at least four times, with delays caused by changes in prime ministers and the revolving door of the secretary of state for culture (there have been eight in five years).\n\nLast July, the review was in Boris Johnson's Downing Street for approval, the final stage before announcement. Instead, it was shelved as Johnson's premiership faltered.\n\nBetting logos are likely to disappear from the front of football shirts under a voluntary Premier League deal (Southampton FC players pictured)\n\nWhen Tony Blair's Labour government introduced the Gambling Act in 2005, it allowed gambling firms to advertise sports betting, poker and online casinos on TV and radio for the first time.\n\nThat legislation predated the arrival of the smartphone a year or two later, a game changer in the world of online betting.\n\n\"With online gambling, there are no barriers in place,\" says consultant psychologist Matt Gaskell, the clinical lead for the NHS Northern Gambling Service.\n\n\"Typically, our service users are gambling from the moment they wake up in the morning in their bed. They take their phone into the bathroom with them, they take it in the car.\n\n\"They're gambling at work and they're gambling when they return home and they can keep it very secret even from their loved ones.\"\n\nThe NHS has clinics across England treating people with gambling problems, including three clinics in the north of England. The service is expanding further. By the end of the year, there will be 15 NHS centres in England dedicated to gambling.\n\nGaskell says an industry which has aggressively targeted punters with habit-forming products offering continuous gambling has caused a \"significant public health crisis\".\n\nHe wants the government to introduce a statutory levy on the gambling companies and to develop a public health message.\n\nThe NHS has clinics across England treating people with gambling problems\n\nAt the moment, the industry funds research, education and treatment into gambling harm on a voluntary basis.\n\nThe Betting and Gaming Council, which represents gambling companies, says its largest members have pledged \u00a3100m over four years, and that the set-up is \"unlike the alcohol industry, which hands the NHS the bill for problems associated with alcohol\".\n\nIn recent weeks, behind the scenes, charities and parliamentarians who want changes have been piling on the pressure.\n\nA letter to the chancellor earlier this month from the chair of Peers for Gambling Reform, Lord Foster, and signed by Mr Gaskell amongst others, says the \"overwhelming consensus is that the current voluntary funding arrangement lacks consistency, transparency and independence from industry influence\".\n\nThey want a firewall; at the moment, Mr Gaskell told me, the public health messaging around gambling \"is paid for by the gambling industry\".\n\n\"So it's a rather meaningless, self-serving messaging\u2026 It doesn't help the public make good, informed decisions.\"\n\nSupport for addiction issues is available via the BBC Action Line.\n\nYou only need to watch a football match to see how normalised gambling has become - or, as the industry puts it and as many see it, how much fun can be had.\n\nIn-play betting has for many fans added extra excitement to those 90 minutes watching your team on the pitch. You can gamble on who will score the next goal, who will get the next penalty, how many minutes there will be of extra time.\n\nEight Premier League clubs now display gambling firm names on the front of their shirts, after sponsorship deals. There is a similar number in the Championship.\n\nThe Betting and Gaming Council told the BBC it supports the Gambling Review to \"raise standards and promote safer gambling, but any changes introduced by the government must not drive gamblers towards the growing unsafe, unregulated black market online\".\n\nThe BGC says the \"rate of problem gambling remains low by international standards at 0.3% of the UK's adult population - down from 0.4% the year previous\".\n\nIt points out that the \"overwhelming majority\" of the 22.5 million people in the UK who enjoy a bet each month, do so \"safely and responsibly\".\n\nJames Grimes, head of education at Gambling With Lives, pictured with students at the UA92 in Manchester\n\nCampaigners for more regulation say they want to protect problem gamblers and for legislation that keeps pace with technology.\n\n\"At the moment, we are probably the country with the most liberal gambling laws in the world,\" the former Conservative leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith told me.\n\nHe's part of the All Party Parliamentary Group on gambling-related harm. They've spent years arguing for more protections especially for children and other vulnerable groups, including forcing gambling companies to pay a statutory levy and a ban on their names on football shirts to \"stop thousands of people wandering around as advertising\".\n\n\"We're not out to stamp out gambling,\" he says. \"We want to have it better regulated so it traps fewer people in spirals of debt.\"\n\nJames Grimes lost \u00a3100,000 to his gambling addiction. The 32-year-old, who lives in Stockport, took out 20 payday loans and borrowed from anyone he could.\n\nDespite being on the minimum wage at the time, Mr Grimes says the gambling industry pushed him to keep betting.\n\n\"They gave me a VIP box at a Premier league football match. They gave me tickets to the horse race and there would be a \u00a3100 free bet in my account every week.\"\n\nJames, who will be five years free of gambling in April, is now the head of education for the charity Gambling With Lives.\n\n\"I still get emails from gambling companies saying 'Come back in, here's 100 free spins'. You wouldn't give an alcoholic 100 free shots of vodka if they stopped drinking five years ago. So why do we allow this to happen? It's a form of grooming.\"\n\nLike David, he was pulled into gambling when he was much younger. He says the impact of potentially addictive gambling products on young brains needs more research.\n\nJames wants the white paper to propose stake limits on online gambling, to bring it into line with physical betting.\n\nHe also wants restrictions on advertising and sponsorship, \"especially in football, which is adored by millions of young people\".\n\nThe role of the Gambling Commission, which licenses and regulates the industry, is also included in the government review.\n\nA spokesman for the commission said it \"creates an opportunity to build on the progress we have made to protect players and the public - such as strengthened age and identity verification, strict new guidance for so-called VIP schemes and banning gambling with credit cards.\"\n\nRyan Myers took his own life before his father found out he had been addicted to gambling\n\nJohn Myers' son Ryan was a football fan. It was only after Ryan took his own life that John and his wife discovered their son was addicted to gambling.\n\nA few months before his suicide, Ryan had even written an email to one of the online gambling firms saying he was \"finally admitting\" he had a serious gambling problem. John shared it with the BBC.\n\nRyan wrote: \"I've woken up this morning to find out I've pretty much emptied my bank account and don't even remember doing it.\n\n\"I know I don't deserve it and can understand if you don't do it but I was wondering if you could find it in your heart to maybe somehow refund some of what I deposited last night and then ban me.\"\n\nJohn Myers, Ryan's father (pictured with Katie Razzall), hopes the white paper will put in greater protections for gamblers\n\nJohn Myers says he doesn't want gambling banned.\n\n\"We want the predatory industry to take some blame\u2026 we want the government to change the rules around it so they can't be as predatory as they are now.\"\n\nHe hopes the white paper will put in greater protections for future Ryans.\n\nIf you have been affected by any of the issues in this article you can visit the BBC's Action Line. for information and support.\n\nHow have you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

I thought they would find a way to beat Arsenal, but now they have to beat Villa and I don't think it's going to be easy for them.\"\n\nSutton is making predictions for every Premier League game this season against a variety of guests.\n\nFor the midweek matches on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, he takes on UB40 drummer & Birmingham City fan Jimmy Brown.\n\nBrown is not the only Blues fan in UB40 and the band have given one of their classic songs a revamp in honour of their beloved club.\n\nForever True is Birmingham City's new anthem, with new lyrics set to the beat of Food For Thought, which is blasted out around St Andrew's at the end of every winning game.\n\nUB40 held a special concert at the stadium at full-time of Monday's game against Preston where they played the new track and other songs from their new album, UB45, which celebrates 45 years of the band and is out on 19 April.\n\nJimmy is here to make predictions for Premier League games but it is the bottom of the Championship he is focused on at the moment, with Birmingham battling to avoid relegation to League One.\n\n\"Believe me when I say I've got my fingers, toes and every single thing crossed,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\n\"I am very nervous, but I am hopeful as well. We've got a good manager in charge now with Gary Rowett back at the club but, however we do it, we just need to stay afloat.\"\n\nJimmy grew up a stone's throw away from St Andrew's and has been a lifelong supporter of the club.\n\nHe explained: \"I was born and brought up in Small Heath which is the same area as the ground, and I lived a 10-minute walk away, so I had to be a Blues fan really.\n\n\"My dad used to take me every week when I was really young and after a while I told him I wasn't enjoying it. It smelled of old men and pies, and it would be 0-0 every week - it was kind of depressing and it put me off football for a few years.\n\n\"But then as I got a bit older I got back into it. I'd still be walking back home feeling miserable after the match, but that's what football is like, isn't it? You have got to take the rough with the smooth.\n\n\"We are not having a great time of it at the moment but there have been plenty of highs along the way.\n\n\"The best moment was probably winning the League Cup final against Arsenal in 2011. We were away touring at the time and we watched the first half on TV at an airport but then had to get on a plane.\n\n\"I thought we'd lost but then when we landed we got messages coming through that we'd actually won. We were all cheering on the plane, and I don't suppose the other passengers knew why.\"\n\nChris Sutton and Jimmy Brown were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\n\nA correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points.

Their squad was already injury ravaged and now their captain Jamaal Lascelles is out for several months too.\n\nI am taking a bit of a punt here, especially given that Everton have gone 12 league games without a win, but I think Newcastle are so stretched and put so much into it on Saturday, that it will catch up with them here.\n\nEverton's big problem is still in attack because they really struggle to find the back of the net but they do create chances and I have a sneaking feeling they will get a result, just like they did when they beat the Magpies 3-0 at Goodison Park in December.\n\nJimmy's prediction: This is a hard one to call because Newcastle have had their problems with injuries. 1-1\n\nOops you can't see this activity!

They have really surprised me this campaign, especially after the way they started it.\n\nI reckon Bournemouth will edge it but I should probably apologise to their fans now for saying that because whenever I back them, they never end up winning.\n\nOops you can't see this activity!

Still, even a draw would keep them in touch with the teams immediately above them.\n\nJimmy's prediction: I like to see all the Midlands teams doing well so I've got to go with Wolves here. 1-2\n\nOops you can't see this activity!

Hammers boss David Moyes took Michail Antonio off when his team were cruising at 3-1 up with around 20 minutes to go and, without him, they could not get up the pitch.\n\nAntonio gave them a great outlet, but Moyes will also be furious at the late goals his side conceded.\n\nThey will be looking to bounce back here, and they will be confident because they have already beaten Tottenham once this season.\n\nThe expansive way Spurs play suits West Ham because they will be able to hit them on the counter-attack. I think Antonio was taken off on Saturday to rest him for this game, and he will play another key role here.\n\nThere should be a few goals at the other end too, though. Tottenham are just relentless going forward and wear teams down. Even if they go behind, I still fancy them to win this one.\n\nJimmy's prediction: Both teams have been up and down so let's go for a draw. 2-2\n\nOops you can't see this activity!

The finish line is in sight but they need to put their foot down to get there first, and that is what I think will happen here.\n\nLooking at the table, goal difference could play a big part in the title race. Arsenal have the advantage there at the moment, but a big scoreline here could change that.\n\nJimmy's prediction: Liverpool are actually my second team, and my Premier League team at the moment.

They've been lucky, right from the start.\n\nAs far as this game goes, well it's anyone's guess. I keep on being wrong about Chelsea, including their 2-2 draw against Burnley on Saturday.\n\nCole Palmer continues to be a bright spark for the Blues but something is not right with the rest of the team. If they cannot beat Burnley at home when the Clarets are down to 10 men, then heaven help them.\n\nAll things considered, it makes this game impossible to predict.

It has already said it will appeal the decision at the Supreme Court.\n\nThere has been concern about how children will be treated under the new migration bill, as well as accusations that existing UK regulations to prevent modern slavery would be undermined.\n\nAlthough the legal duty to deport migrants would not apply to under-18s the bill would give ministers new powers to deport them in certain circumstances.\n\nIt would also get rid of the current three day-limit on how long children and pregnant women can be detained, as well as the 24-hour maximum for children unaccompanied by an adult.\n\nThe government argues detention powers are necessary to ensure migrants destined for removal do not \"disappear into the community\" - and says no one would be held longer than is \"absolutely necessary\" to ensure they are deported.\n\nIt adds that there is also an over-arching legal duty to ensure the length of detention is \"reasonable\", adding that leaving the UK voluntarily will \"always be an option for all\".\n\nHowever in series of votes on Wednesday, a handful of Conservatives teamed up with opposition peers to preserve the detention limits.\n\nTory peer Baroness Mobarik, who proposed the amendments, said \"verbal assurances\" from ministers were not enough and \"necessary safeguards\" had to be added to the bill itself.\n\n\"The psychological harms of detention on young children is significant and likely to impact them for the rest of their lives,\" she added.\n\nImmigration Minister Lord Murray of Blidworth said safeguards were already in place for the detention of pregnant women, whilst those in the later stages of pregnancy would be released on immigration bail.\n\nChild detention was also a contentious issue when the bill was debated in the Commons, with the government avoiding a showdown with Tory rebels by promising to listen to concerns.\n\nTim Loughton, who spearheaded the rebellion, said at the time he wanted a maximum limit to remain.\n\nIn other votes on Monday, the Lords voted to ban deportations of LGBT migrants to 10 mainly African countries, including Rwanda, Nigeria and Kenya - with a specific ban on trans men and women being deported to Brazil.\n\nWhen the proposed bans were initially debated last week, Crossbench peer Lord Etherton, who suggested them, said the countries were \"hostile and unsafe\" for LGBT people.\n\nPeers also approved an amendment to retain the role of the courts in deciding what a \"reasonable\" length of detention is - striking down new powers in the bill that would allow ministers to decide.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nMPs have said Boris Johnson may have misled Parliament multiple times over Partygate - but the former PM insists he will be vindicated by their report.\n\nThe privileges committee said it had seen evidence that \"strongly suggests\" Covid rule breaches would have been \"obvious\" to Mr Johnson.\n\nBut Mr Johnson said he never \"knowingly or recklessly\" misled MPs about lockdown gatherings in Downing Street.\n\nAnd he said he was confident he would be cleared by the committee.\n\nHe is due to give evidence to the committee later this month.\n\nIn an initial report published on Friday, the MPs highlighted ways in which he may have misled Parliament.\n\nThese include a statement on 8 December 2021 no rules or guidance had been broken in Number 10.\n\nMr Johnson told BBC News he did not \"know or suspect\" that events broke the rules when he spoke about them in the Commons.\n\nHe added that \"after 10 months of effort\" the committee had not produced evidence \"to suggest otherwise\".\n\n\"I didn't mislead the House, and I don't believe I'm guilty of a contempt. I think that this process happily will vindicate me,\" he said.\n\nThe committee has published extracts from a series of WhatsApp messages it has received as part of its inquiry.\n\nIn one from 28 April 2021, seven months before press reports about parties first appeared, an unnamed No 10 official noted that another official was \"worried about leaks of PM having a piss up and to be fair I don't think it's unwarranted\".\n\nIn another, from 25 January 2022, Mr Johnson's then director of communications, Jack Doyle, told a No 10 official he hadn't \"heard any explanation\" of how a birthday party for the former PM in the Cabinet Room in June 2020 was within the rules.\n\nIn a separate WhatsApp exchange the same day, an official messaged Mr Doyle, saying: \"I'm trying to do some Q&A [briefing for officials dealing with the media queries], it's not going well\".\n\nMr Doyle replied: \"I'm struggling to come up with a way this one is in the rules in my head\", adding: \"PM was eating his lunch of course\".\n\nThe official responded: \"I meant for the police bit but yeah as ridiculous as the cake thing is it is difficult\".\n\nThe official then suggested they could argue it was \"reasonably necessary for work purposes\".\n\nMr Doyle replied: \"Not sure that one works does it. Also blows another great gaping hole in the PM's account doesn't it?\"\n\nBoris Johnson celebrates his birthday - for which he received a fine - in a previously unseen image released by the committee\n\nIn May last year, an inquiry by senior civil servant Sue Gray found widespread rule-breaking had taken place, and Mr Johnson was among 83 people fined by police for attending law-breaking events.\n\nThe privileges committee said it would take Ms Gray's findings into account.\n\nIt emerged this week that Ms Gray has quit the civil service and is set to become chief of staff to Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, prompting claims from Tory MPs that she was politically biased.\n\nMr Johnson said it raised questions over the conclusions over her inquiry.\n\n\"I think people may look at it in a different light,\" he told BBC News.\n\nHe added that he \"might have cross-examined her more closely about her independence\" if \"you'd told me all the stuff that I now know\".\n\nHe added it was \"surreal\" that MPs investigating whether he misled Parliament over Partygate were planning to take her inquiry into account.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

The BBC has not verified where and when the footage was made, or how the soldier was captured.\n\nThe general staff of Ukraine's armed forces said: \"The shooting of an unarmed prisoner is a cynical and brazen disregard for the norms of international humanitarian law and the customs of war. This is what worthless murderers do, not warriors.\n\n\"The Russian occupiers have once again shown that their main goal in Ukraine is the brutal extermination of Ukrainians.\"\n\nRussia has not publicly commented on the incident.\n\nIn his video address, President Zelensky said \"the occupiers\" killed \"a warrior who bravely said to their faces: 'Glory to Ukraine!'\"\n\n\"I want us all to respond to his words together, in unity: 'Glory to the Hero! Glory to the Heroes! Glory to Ukraine!'\"\n\nMr Zelensky was referring to a battle cry in Ukraine's military that has become popular among millions of Ukrainians.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted that the footage was \"another proof this war is genocidal\", and he called for an \"immediate investigation\" by the International Criminal Court.\n\nAnd Ukraine's Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin said a criminal investigation had already been opened.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ukraine's military named the soldier as Tymofiy Shadura, citing preliminary information.\n\nHis unit, the 30th Separate Mechanised Brigade, said he was last seen on 3 February near the eastern city of Bakhmut - the scene of fierce fighting in recent months.\n\nBut it added that the identification could only be completed after the body was returned.\n\nBefore the soldier was named, Mr Shadura's sister, Olia, said she recognised her brother: \"[He] would certainly be capable of standing up to the Russians like that,\" she told the BBC.\n\nHowever, there is some doubt over the identity of the soldier, with one well-known Ukrainian journalist naming him as somebody else.\n\nMr Shadura's sister later told the BBC that she was not collecting money on behalf of relatives due to the conflicting reports on the unarmed soldier's identity.\n\n\"I recognise my brother in that video.

He will join the club in the summer, with Frank Lampard remaining as interim manager until the end of the season. Pochettino, who has also managed Southampton, has been out of work since Paris St-Germain replaced him with Christophe Galtier in summer 2022. The 51-year-old Argentine managed Spurs for five years from 2014 and led them to the 2019 Champions League final.\n\u2022 None Balague: Chelsea are in turmoil - why has Pochettino chosen them?\n\u2022 None Quiz: Can you name all of the Blues' Premier League managers? Pochettino will be Chelsea's sixth permanent manager in five years, following the sacking of Thomas Tuchel and Graham Potter earlier this season. Lampard took interim charge of the Blues at the start of April following Potter's dismissal. Chelsea have had a difficult season, losing to Manchester City in the third round of both the FA Cup and League Cup. They also lost to Real Madrid in the quarter-finals of the Champions League, which ended any viable hopes of them qualifying for Europe next season. They are currently 11th in the Premier League, having won just one of their past 11 games, losing eight of them. Pochettino had been linked with a return to Tottenham after they parted company with Antonio Conte in March. He guided Spurs to the League Cup final in 2015 and a Premier League runners-up spot in 2016-17, with his side missing out on winning both to Chelsea. Following his stint at Tottenham, Pochettino took over from Tuchel at PSG in January 2021. The French club finished second in Ligue 1 at the end of the 2020-21 campaign but did win the Coupe de France and the Trophee des Champions, which were the first trophies of Pochettino's managerial career. Pochettino started his managerial career with Espanyol before his 16-month spell at Southampton. Pochettino wants a team fans can 'fall in love with' - Balague In April, Spanish football expert Guillem Balague told BBC's Football Focus that the Argentine was approached in September as a possible replacement for Tuchel, but turned the club down before they appointed Potter. \"It was a different time where I think Chelsea had made up their mind on Potter, and Pochettino sensed that,\" said Balague. \"Now it feels like the club is ready for him. Before, the fans were missing Tuchel, who won them the Champions League the year before. \"But the fans and the club are wanting him to arrive.\" Balague believes Pochettino wants to produce a team Chelsea fans can \"fall in love with\". \"He wants a team that presses, that is aggressive - he wants players that know they have to fight to get into the starting XI,\" Balague added. \"He is obviously going to have to trim the squad and those players that stay will have to fight for their place and know that nothing is guaranteed.\"\n\u2022 None Listen to the latest The Far Post podcast\n\u2022 None Our coverage of Chelsea is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment\n\u2022 None Everything Chelsea - go straight to all the best content", "The judge ruled that he was satisfied that Mr Adams meets the test for compensation\n\nGerry Adams was wrongly denied compensation after his convictions for trying to escape from prison in the 1970s were quashed, the High Court has ruled.\n\nThe former Sinn F\u00e9in president won an appeal to have two historical convictions overturned in 2020.\n\nMr Justice Colton said he was satisfied that Mr Adams meets the test for compensation.\n\nHe also ordered the Department of Justice to reconsider Mr Adams's application.\n\nMr Adams had been found guilty of two attempts to escape from lawful custody while being held at the Maze Prison - then known as Long Kesh internment camp - in 1973 and 1974.\n\nHe was in jail because he had been interned without trial, a practice that was introduced in Northern Ireland amid spiralling violence in the early 1970s.\n\nMore than 1,900 people suspected of being members of paramilitary organisations were detained, but many were arrested based on flawed intelligence.\n\nMr Adams, who has consistently denied being a member of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), was later sentenced to a total of four-and-a-half years in jail.\n\nIn 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that his detention had been unlawful and quashed both convictions.\n\nThe interim custody order (ICO) used to initially detain him was held to be invalid because the then-Northern Ireland secretary, Willie Whitelaw, had not personally authorised it.\n\nMr Adams issued judicial review proceedings after a subsequent application for compensation was turned down.\n\nUnder the statutory scheme, payment for a miscarriage of justice is made in cases where \"a new or newly-discovered fact\" shows the person did not commit the offence, which lawyers representing Mr Adams argued he qualifies under based on new circumstances established by the Supreme Court.\n\nMr Adams' lawyer said the newly-discovered fact in this case was the confirmation that \"there was no personal consideration by the secretary of state, and that (another) minister of state signed the ICO without authorisation to do so\".\n\n\"If the applicant was not lawfully detained, he did not commit the offence he was convicted of.\n\n\"The newly-discovered fact led to the quashing of these convictions,\" he added.\n\nA lawyer for the Department of Justice had argued it was the analysis of a legal point which led to the guilty verdicts being overturned, rather than a new or newly-discovered fact.\n\nThe judge stressed that both counsels were unaware of the factual situation surrounding the invalid ICO.\n\n\"The applicant has been convicted of a criminal offence, his conviction has been reversed in circumstances where a newly-discovered fact, the lack of consideration by the secretary of state, shows beyond reasonable doubt that there has been a miscarriage of justice, that is the applicant is innocent of the crime for which he was convicted,\" he said.\n\nHe concluded that the Department of Justice had \"erred in law\" in determining that the reversal of Mr Adams's conviction arose from a legal ruling on facts, something which he said had been known all along.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

But, speaking of mental health, phones can provide a good social connection.\n\n\"If you're having a rough time with anything, then you should have the right to talk to someone,\" she told the BBC.\n\nIn 2021, the then-education secretary, Gavin Williamson, called for a ban on mobile phones in schools in England, but current Department for Education (DfE) guidance says it is up to head teachers to decide if mobile phones can be used during the school day.\n\nHowever, it warns allowing access to mobiles in school introduces risks, including distraction, disruption, bullying and abuse, and can be detrimental to learning.\n\n\"Head teachers should consider restricting or prohibiting mobile phones to reduce these risks,\" DfE guidance states.\n\nIn June, a parents association for eight primary schools in Ireland introduced a voluntary ban on smartphones for children in the home or at school, the BBC's Newsround reported.\n\nSpeaking to Newsround, one 14-year old - who had only recently been given their first phone - said giving phones to children as young as eight was \"ridiculous\".\n\n\"Some parents put restrictions on phones, but some don't - and then they can be seeing really inappropriate things.\"\n\nBut others countered that mobile phones were useful for contacting parents, saying banning home use was excessive.\n\nIn 2017, Bangladesh banned both students and teachers in schools and colleges from bringing mobile phones into classrooms.\n\nFrance also has a ban but makes exceptions for certain groups of students, for example those with disabilities, or when smartphones are used for teaching.\n\nAnd next year the Netherlands will mostly ban mobile phones, tablets and smartwatches from secondary school classrooms.\n\nHowever, Sarah Hannafin, head of policy at school leaders' union NAHT said a ban on mobiles might work for some schools but in others could cause more problems than it solved, \"leading to pupils becoming more secretive about their phone use meaning problems are hidden from staff and therefore more difficult to spot and address\".\n\n\"There are also practical reasons why pupils may need a mobile phone such as while travelling to and from school\".\n\nSchools helped to prepare young people for the outside world, including managing screen time, she said.\n\n\"Individual schools know their pupils and communities so are best placed to develop their own policies when it comes to mobile phones.\"", "The streets of Khartoum have been described as like a \"ghost town\" by some\n\nAfter fighting had rocked their home city, Khartoum, for more than a week, Dallia Mohamed Abdelmoniem and her family made the \"gut-wrenching\" decision to leave.\n\nThey had originally planned to escape on 19 April, but their cars had been vandalised in the fighting that had taken place near their home. The next day, relatives came and helped them move to the city's outskirts.\n\nFrom there they would have to make a choice - make the 1,000km (620-mile) trip north to the Egyptian border, then onwards to Cairo, or the slightly shorter 850km journey north-east to Port Sudan, on the Red Sea.\n\nWith fighting between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) taking place across much of the country, both routes would be risky.\n\n\"We decided not to try Egypt because of the length of the trip - we had kids and elderly people with us, so it didn't make sense,\" she told the BBC, referring to their travelling party that was made up of 23 family members.\n\nWith thousands going to Egypt, they were also worried about hold-ups at the border - with family members in Port Sudan, they went there instead.\n\n\"It took so long because the bus driver said he wasn't taking any risks; he didn't want to meet any RSF fighters, so he took the long way round,\" she said.\n\nThey did manage to avoid RSF fighters, although there were army checkpoints every few hours.\n\n\"I must say they were very civil, they just wanted to make sure we were family and there were no RSF fighters hiding among us,\" she said.\n\nDespite the turmoil the country is facing - more than 3,500 wounded and at least 400 killed, although the death toll is thought to be much higher - Ms Abdelmoniem said there were uplifting moments along the way, notably when a group of people living by the side of the road rushed to their bus to offer them drinks, snacks and good luck messages for their journey.\n\n\"It is the one positive memory I will have of this time - and a reminder that we are nothing to do with the fighting and suffering our country is facing,\" she said.\n\nTheir bus arrived at Port Sudan on Monday evening, where things were \"very calm\", she said.\n\n\"It's like being on a completely different planet to Khartoum - you wouldn't think there are any issues here.\"\n\nA view of the road between Khartoum and Port Sudan\n\nBut their journey is far from over. Ms Abdelmoniem thinks the fighting will cause the country to plunge further into chaos in the weeks and months ahead.\n\nSudan already has an \"acute\" shortage of food, water, medicine and fuel, as well as limited access to electricity and communications, Madiha Raza, from the International Rescue Committee, told the BBC.\n\n\"Prices of essential items are increasing substantially because of shortages\", and humanitarian operations have been suspended, Ms Raza said.\n\nMs Abdelmoniem thinks the situation \"will get desperate\" and is planning to take her mother to a safe country, before returning to Sudan when it is safe to do so.\n\n\"I don't want to become a refugee, I want to come back - I call myself temporarily displaced,\" she said.\n\nAsked how she felt about having to leave her home, she described it as \"one of the worst feelings I have experienced - I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy\".\n\n\"I don't know when I will go back, and I don't know if my house will still be standing. That's not a feeling I would wish on anyone. It's horrible, it's gut-wrenching,\" she said.\n\nWith much of the fighting centred around Khartoum, many residents have chosen to leave, although it is currently difficult to say how many.\n\nMany others have chosen to stay, however - although that has not been an easy decision either.\n\nTagreed Abdin is one of those choosing to remain in the capital, despite being able to hear the fighting from her home.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC by phone over a crackly line on Tuesday, she had to pause the interview halfway through as she heard fighting and shelling outside - despite a ceasefire, the fourth since fighting began, starting hours earlier.\n\nMs Abdin said she feels safer at home than on the streets, where she has heard stories - and seen videos online - of people being \"attacked, robbed, or worse\".\n\nThere are also reports of corpses of dead soldiers lining the streets, and widespread looting.\n\n\"We have electricity and power right now - so we feel that home is safer than venturing out,\" she said, although she added that a few days ago that feeling of safety was shaken when a nearby apartment building was struck in the fighting.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\n\"We're in survival mode,\" she said of her family's life at home, adding that they currently have power and running water.\n\n\"We're hoping and praying for the power to stay on,\" she said.\n\nThere are also logistical challenges with leaving, with bus ticket prices skyrocketing. She said one bus journey that cost $20 (\u00a316) before the fighting began is now $300, while there are also concerns about visas for her husband and teenage sons if they make it to the Egyptian border.\n\n\"So for us it's not a case of 'pack your bags and run' - that might be the case for some people, but it's not for us,\" she said.\n\nShe added that she wanted to send a message to those fighting - to \"keep civilians out of this\".\n\n\"If there is any type of agreement reached, or any external pressure, then it must be to guarantee the lives and safety of the Sudanese people,\" she said.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. \"You cash in on sexual violence against women\" - Tang Zhuoran questioned by BBC reporter Zhaoyin Feng\n\nWomen who are groped on trains in East Asia face the further threat of their assault being filmed and uploaded for sale online. In a year-long investigation, the BBC World Service's investigative unit, BBC Eye, has gone undercover to unmask the men cashing in on sexual violence.\n\nIt was the morning rush hour in Tokyo. The train was packed and rocky.\n\nTakako (not her real name) was on her way to school. The 15-year-old tried to hold on to a grab bar.\n\nSuddenly, she felt a hand pressing on her behind. She thought someone had accidentally bumped into her.\n\nBut the hand started to grope her.\n\n\"That's when I finally realised - it was molestation,\" Takako recalls.\n\nThe hand quickly disappeared in the crowd. \"I couldn't do anything about it.\" She arrived at school in tears that day.\n\nThat was her first time being sexually assaulted on public transport, but Takako was molested almost daily for more than a year on her commute. On countless nights, she went to bed crying. \"I felt like there was no hope in my life,\" she says.\n\nTakako. who was sexually assaulted many times as a teenager, wears a badge that warns off potential attackers\n\nMany women like Takako are targeted in public by sexual predators. In some cases, they face another violation - the attack is filmed and the videos are sold online.\n\nMost videos follow the same pattern - a man secretly films a woman from behind and follows her on to a train. Seconds later, he sexually abuses her. The men act discreetly, and their victims can seem totally unaware. These graphic videos are then listed on the websites for sale.\n\nIn a year-long investigation, we traced the men behind three websites which sell and produce thousands of these sexual assault videos.\n\nEncountering sexual abuse almost daily, Takako found herself unable to speak up during the act due to fear and shame. But every night, she covered her mouth with a towel and repeatedly practised in front of the mirror how to call out a harasser: \"This person is a 'Chikan'!\"\n\n\"Chikan\" is a Japanese term describing sexual assault in public, especially groping on public transport. It also describes the offenders themselves.\n\nChikan perpetrators typically take advantage of crowds, and the victims' fear of causing a scene. In Japan, speaking too directly and openly may be seen as rude.\n\nThousands of arrests are made every year for Chikan offences, but many more go undetected and unpunished. Saito Akiyoshi, mental health professional and author of a book about Chikan, says that only about 10% of victims report the crime.\n\nThe Japanese police encourage victims and eyewitnesses to speak up, but the crime is far from being eradicated. The problem is so widespread that even the UK and Canadian governments warn travellers to Japan about it.\n\nChikan has been normalised by its prominence in Japan's adult entertainment industry. One of the most popular types of pornography in the country - the Chikan genre - has spread to other Asian countries.\n\nThe metro trains in Tokyo become incredibly crowded at certain points of the day\n\nOne Chinese-language website called DingBuZhu (which means \"I can't hold it\" in Chinese) immediately caught our attention.\n\nIt's a marketplace for Chikan videos, filmed secretly on mobile phones in crowded public places, such as trains and buses. They are shot across East Asia, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland China.\n\nSome videos cost less than a dollar. The site even once allowed users to order tailor-made abuse videos.\n\nWe also found links on DingBuZhu to two other websites - Chihan and Jieshe - with the same type of content.\n\nThere is a Telegram group with 4,000 members who share tips on how to sexually abuse women.\n\nOne name kept coming up on the Chikan websites - \"Uncle Qi\".\n\nHe was hailed as the guru in this community. Dozens of abuse videos were labelled as his work. On Twitter, he put up teasers of the websites' videos to his 80,000 followers. But who was he?\n\nThe Telegram group we had been monitoring revealed a clue. One day, an admin claimed in a series of messages that he had abused a woman with Uncle Qi.\n\nThe messages were accompanied by photos of a woman standing on what appeared to be a metro platform.\n\nWithin hours, we found a match for the location - Ikebukuro station in Tokyo.\n\nBBC Eye investigates websites selling thousands of videos of men sexually assaulting women on trains, buses and other crowded public places across East Asia.\n\nWatch on BBC iPlayer now (UK only), or on BBC Three at 22:50 BST on Thursday 8 June\n\nAnd there were more leads pointing us to Japan.\n\nThe websites listed a Paypal account receiving Japanese yen which was linked to a Gmail address. When we put the address through Google Contacts, the profile picture that came up was a young man with an elaborate hairstyle and theatrical makeup.\n\nA reverse image search put a name to the face - Noctis Zang, a 30-year-old Chinese-born singer living in Tokyo. He was the frontman of a metal band called The Versus.\n\nAn internet search revealed the name of Noctis Zang, a Chinese rock singer\n\nNoctis had a glamorous public image, but we soon found something hidden behind it.\n\nIn early 2022, The Versus' photographer had alleged on Chinese social media platform Weibo that Noctis built \"porn websites\" alongside another band member, Lupus Fu.\n\nHe had posted pictures of a notebook, which showed some accounting and video categories similar to those on the websites. The photographer had also posted a video which appeared to show Noctis's browsing history, with links to Chihan, Jieshe and the admin pages of DingBuZhu.\n\nCould this rock singer be Uncle Qi?\n\nPosing as a music talent scout called Ian, our undercover journalist met Noctis at a fancy rooftop bar in Tokyo.\n\nThey first talked about music, but the chat soon moved on to the subject of sex. When Ian said his company used to make porn films, Noctis's eyes lit up.\n\nThe two met several more times, and they even celebrated Noctis's birthday together.\n\nNoctis introduced Ian to his fellow band member Lupus Fu, whose name had been mentioned by The Versus' photographer. Lupus, also from China, was studying sociology in Japan.\n\nIan said his company planned to invest in porn sites and asked if they knew anything about this business.\n\nOur undercover reporter, Ian, met key figures linked to one of the abuse video sites in a Tokyo bar\n\nNoctis confessed he had \"some exposure\" through a friend, \"Maomi\", who had created his own porn sites with \"metro\" content.\n\nLupus and Noctis both laughed: \"That's Maomi's website!\"\n\nThey revealed that the person behind the Chikan websites was a Chinese man in Tokyo nicknamed Maomi. They said Maomi was reclusive and paranoid.\n\nNoctis and Lupus also admitted that they played admin roles for the websites.\n\nThey spelled out their business model.\n\n\"In China, sex is the most suppressed,\" Noctis said, \"Some men are very perverted, they just want to see women getting\u2026\" Lupus finished the sentence: \"screwed over.\"\n\nLupus said he was in charge of promoting abuse videos on Twitter. Noctis revealed that he had uploaded more than 5,000 videos on the websites, received payments for the business and taken 30% of revenue. The rest he had transferred to Maomi.\n\nLupus also said he could help connect Ian to Maomi.\n\nOn a quiet back street in the red-light district of Yokohama, a storefront decorated like a metro station catches your eyes. A sign spells out its concept: \"legal Chikan trains\".\n\nIn this sex club, called Rush Hour, customers can pay to enjoy the Chikan experience legally.\n\nIts manager Hasuda Shuhei welcomes us on board. \"We let people do things that can't be done outside. That's why people come here.\"\n\nInside, a sickly-sweet smell of cleaning products permeates the air. Private rooms are decorated like train carriages and equipped with a sound system that plays train announcements. Even the club's membership cards look exactly like Japan's transportation cards.\n\nDecorated like a train carriage, the Rush Hour sex club offers customers the chance to act out fantasies of public groping\n\n\"I think it's important for men to be able to pay to vent in place like this, so they don't commit rape and other forms of sexual assault,\" says Hasuda.\n\nMental health professional Saito says that the matter is not as straightforward as Hasuda claims. He says that most Chikan perpetrators are aroused by the idea of domination over and humiliation of their victims.\n\n\"They do not treat their victims as equals, but as objects.\"\n\nIt's an opinion that rings true with Takako.\n\nAfter months of assaults, she fought back one day. As she felt a hand reach for her skirt in a packed train carriage, Takako shouted at the top of her lungs and grabbed the assaulter by his wrist.\n\nTakako took the man to court, where he only got a suspended sentence, even though he had previously been caught for Chikan offences.\n\nDisappointed by the outcome of her case, Takako went on to start an anti-Chikan campaign, producing colourful badges reading \"Chikan is a crime!\" People can wear them to show they will not keep silent.\n\n\"It's a deterrent for criminals,\" says Takako, who is now 24. There is now an annual anti-Chikan badge design contest among Japanese high school students.\n\nCampaigners make anti-Chikan badges to raise awareness of sexual assaults on public transport\n\nMaomi means \"kitty cat\" in Chinese. However, Lupus said his personality was more like a hamster. \"He's harmless, but cautious of everything and he sometimes overreacts.\"\n\nLupus was right. Maomi repeatedly refused to meet Ian.\n\nBut on Chinese New Year's Eve, Ian's luck changed. Maomi agreed to a meeting at a karaoke bar.\n\nThe air was thick with cigarette smoke, the sound of clinking glasses and Chinese pop songs.\n\nThe person who turned up was not who we expected. A skinny young man wearing half-rim glasses and a dark trench coat, Maomi looked like he could be a college student. He said he was 27.\n\nShowing an interest in investing in his business, Ian asked how much he made.\n\n\"Our daily turnover is around 5,000-10,000 Chinese Yuan (US$700-$1,400; \u00a3565-\u00a31,130),\" Maomi said proudly, showing the transactions on his phone. \"Very stable income, right?\"\n\nIan acted impressed, and mentioned the name Uncle Qi.\n\nBut to our surprise, he revealed Uncle Qi was not just one person.\n\nHe managed a team of 15 people, including 10 in China who made videos under the same name. Maomi received 30 to 100 videos from them each month.\n\nThe videos were then sold on the three websites which Maomi confirmed he owned. They had more than 10,000 paying members, mostly Chinese men.\n\n\"The key is to be authentic. It has to be real,\" Maomi said. He later told us his websites even sold videos of drug-facilitated rape.\n\nMaomi talked about his business as though it were any other budding start-up. He described his team as \"passionate\" and \"brave\". He even casually mentioned he had been training others to carry out and film sexual assaults.\n\nBut there was one thing he never mentioned - the women in his videos. It was as if they didn't matter to him at all.\n\nWe wanted to know Maomi's real identity. At another meeting with Ian, he opened up about how he got into this business.\n\nLike many boys, Maomi liked Superman, anime and video games growing up. But when he was 14, he started watching sexual assault videos like the ones he sold now.\n\nHe knew his business was not risk-free.\n\n\"I am so cautious,\" Maomi said. \"Safety first.\" To avoid scrutiny from the Chinese authorities, he planned to naturalise as a Japanese citizen.\n\nHowever, as careful as Maomi was, he made a mistake.\n\nWhen Ian asked where to send the investment funds, Maomi pulled out his bank card and handed it to Ian.\n\nThe card revealed his real name - Tang Zhuoran.\n\nLater, we confronted Maomi with our allegations.\n\nAs we approached, he tried to cover his face and walked away. And all of a sudden, he snapped, hitting out at our camera and crew.\n\nThe next day, by coincidence, we spotted Maomi at the airport. He was leaving Japan.\n\nUncle Qi's Twitter account, where he openly promotes the abuse videos, is still active.\n\nTwitter did not respond to our request for comment. Instead, they sent us a poo emoji, which has been an automatic reply to any inquiry directed to their press email since March.\n\nWe also put our allegations to Noctis and Lupus. They did not respond. We have since learned they no longer work with Maomi.\n\nOn a spring day, we meet up with Takako to tell her about our investigation. Appalled, she says: \"We women are just content in their videos. They see us as objects.

But Mayor Femke Halsema complained last year that cruise tourists were let loose for a couple of hours, ate at international chains and had no time to visit a museum, consuming the city but doing little for it.\n\nThe other key reason for removing cruise ships is to lower air pollution levels in Amsterdam.

They have collectively launched dozens of cyber-attacks - celebrating each one on social media.\n\nThe certificates were sent to them all for \"a significant contribution to the development and maintenance of vital activities of the military\". They were signed by the commander of the Airborne Assault Forces of Ukraine.\n\nUkraine's Ministry of Defence did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.\n\nSince the start of the conflict, Ukraine has controversially been encouraging volunteer hackers to attack Russian targets. But sending out official awards to foreign civilians is being seen as a controversial move and a sign of the times.\n\nAlthough many nations, including the UK and the US, have official award systems for ethical hacking, this is thought to be the first time a country has awarded hackers for malicious and possibly criminal hacks.\n\nIn October, in response to the increase in vigilante hacking in Ukraine and in the Gaza conflict, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) warned against the use and encouragement of civilian hackers. It published guidelines to reinforce the ethos of the rules of war laid out in the existing Geneva Conventions.\n\nA member of a Polish vigilante hacking gang called Squad 303 which has also carried out attacks on Russia\n\nDr Lukasz Olejnik, author of Philosophy of Cyber-security, said Ukraine's awards to foreign hackers are potentially problematic.\n\n\"Giving out awards may further blur the lines between combatants and civilians, and even undermine the recent call by the ICRC to limit and end the involvement of civilians in combat operations. In the long run, such an erosion is dangerous,\" he said.\n\nDr Olejnik also said it is a \"testament of our times\" that cyber is now considered as a domain of operations and that anyone can join the fight online.\n\nKristopher started hacking Russia when it launched the full-scale invasion in February 2022, and says he has devoted himself to the cause and sacrificed a lot.\n\n\"I've lost my job doing this and spent all my life savings in pursuit of a victory for Ukraine,\" he said from his home office. \"This award is a real morale-booster,\" he said.\n\nThe awards do not state which cyber-attacks were most useful, but Voltage has three in mind as the most likely candidates.\n\nAt the start of the invasion in 2022, One Fist spent months mapping out the physical and cyber-locations of hundreds of publicly viewable CCTV cameras in Ukraine. It was discovered that Russian forces were using them to monitor troops, so his team helped get the cameras switched off.\n\nConversely, it was One Fist that hacked into cameras in occupied Crimea to catalogue Russian tanks and equipment being moved over the Kerch bridge.\n\nOne Fist hacked cameras to allow Ukraine to watch Russian equipment transport\n\nAnd most recently, in January, Kristopher and others also successfully hacked into a prominent Russian weapons-maker and stole 100 gigabytes of private data, which led to a public celebration from the Ukrainian authorities.\n\n\"The array of information transferred to the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine contains drawings, specifications, patents, software referring to both existing and promising military developments,\" the announcement said.\n\nUkraine added that the data stolen was a \"significant blow\" to Moscow and worth $1.5bn (\u00a31.2bn) - although it did not say how this figure was reached\n\nThe Ukraine conflict prompted a surge of cyber-activity - mostly from supporters of Ukraine. Groups like the Anonymous collective targeted Russia with disruptive and low-level hacks that Russia largely brushed off.\n\nIn some instances, TV and radio stations were hijacked and news websites defaced.\n\nRussian authorities too have been accused of working with vigilante hacking groups like Killnet to attack Ukraine, but has never admitted having any relationship to the gangs.\n\nKillnet's leader denies working with Russian authorities on hacks against Ukraine\n\nMost of the vigilante hacking activity on both sides dissipated after the first year as the war ground on. But One Fist has kept attacking Russia and increasingly worked closely with the Ukrainian forces on choosing targets.\n\nEmily Taylor, chief executive of Oxford Information Labs and editor of Chatham House Cyber Policy journal, agrees that the hacking awards are a landmark moment that might shift thinking about how cyber volunteers are used in conflicts.\n\n\"Governments usually discourage non-state actors from taking direct action in the cyber-domain, for fear of escalation or unintended consequences, but wartime is often a period of extraordinary technological innovation, and the Ukraine invasion is no exception,\" she said.\n\n\"Sometimes these events force a reconsideration of issues that have previously been taboo.\"\n\nKristopher says his team has built up a strong relationship with the Ukrainian military. \"They send us ideas and we send them options but they don't ever give us any help or funding as I think that would cross some sort of line,\" he said.\n\nKristopher recognises that receiving military awards is controversial, but is determined to keep hacking for Ukraine.", "The chancellor is expected to extend the Energy Price Guarantee at current levels for a further three months, the BBC understands.\n\nTypical household energy bills were scheduled to rise to \u00a33,000 a year from April, but calls have been made for the government to retain its current level of support with the cap at \u00a32,500.\n\nThe level of help is now expected to be maintained, but energy firms have been asked to prepare for both scenarios.\n\nAt the moment, the government is limiting the typical household bill to \u00a32,500 a year, plus a \u00a3400 winter discount.\n\nFrom 1 April the help is scheduled to be scaled back, and the \u00a3400 discount will come to an end, which could push people's bills up despite the weather getting warmer.\n\nFuel poverty campaigners have said the number of households struggling to afford bills could rise from 6.7 million to 8.4 million as a result of the April rise.\n\nHowever, industry sources told the BBC that some energy companies have already started amending future bills to reflect that energy help will continue at or very near to current levels beyond 1 April.\n\nChancellor Jeremy Hunt to date has declined to extend the support at the current rate, but experts have suggested it is increasingly likely he will change course, probably at the Budget on 15 March.\n\nMr Hunt told the BBC last month that the policy was \"under review\".\n\nThe Treasury was understood to be concerned that an open-ended commitment would leave British public finances significantly exposed to any further unexpected rise in global gas prices.\n\nInstead the decrease in support will kick in in the summer, when it will not be needed, because the separate energy price cap is already anticipated to be lower as a result of declining market gas prices.\n\nHowever, the \u00a3400 winter payment that has led to a \u00a366 per month reduction in monthly payments on many bills does look likely to end next month.\n\nThere have been no talks about extending this element of support.\n\nThe Resolution Foundation think tank, which aims to improve living standards for people on low to middle incomes, and consumer rights champion Martin Lewis have both called on Mr Hunt to cancel the bills rise, as have opposition parties.\n\nLabour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said: \"Families are really worried about prices soaring in April and so it's urgent the government gives them reassurance now, and extends the windfall tax on oil and gas giants to give them support for their energy bills as Labour would.\"\n\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), an economics research institute, has forecast that the Treasury could afford to keep support at current levels until the summer due to wholesale energy prices falling sharply, meaning the cost of the scheme had been cut.\n\nEnergy UK, which represents suppliers, urged the government earlier this week to hold the level of support at \u00a32,500 for a typical household and to \"announce that quickly\" so firms could price it into bills from April.\n\nEnergy Secretary Grant Shapps previously said he is \"very sympathetic\" to suggestions that the planned \u00a3500 rise in bills should be stopped.\n\nHowever, there is an alternative view that money would be better spent by the government by targeting support for those on the lowest incomes - as is the case for cost-of-living payments - and in the winter.\n\n\"Vulnerable groups could benefit substantially from this extra funding if it was used in a more targeted way. And should those groups take precedence over universal payments to multiple homeowners and billionaires?\" said Joe Malinowski, founder of comparison site Energyscanner.\n\nThere has been a drop in wholesale gas and electricity prices in recent weeks that has raised hopes that the worst of the energy crisis could be easing.\n\nBills began rising as Covid lockdowns ended but the war in Ukraine saw them surge further.\n\nWithout the government's Energy Price Guarantee to limit prices, a typical household's gas and electricity bill would have hit \u00a34,279 a year from January under the energy price cap set by Ofgem, the industry regulator.\n\nHow is the rising cost of living changing how you live your life?

There will be a further day of debate in the Lords before it returns to the Commons.\n\nOne amendment would make it a legal duty for ministers to create safe and legal routes to the UK for refugees by next spring. Two others reinstate and expand a right of appeal against age assessments for migrants claiming to be children.\n\nAhead of Wednesday's debate, the Archbishops of Canterbury and York urged ministers to back changes to the legislation to ensure a \"just\" and \"compassionate\" asylum policy.\n\nIn a letter to The Times signed by eight other faith leaders, the two archbishops warned the legislation \"falls short of our obligation to the most vulnerable\".\n\nThe prime minister's official spokesman said he was not going to respond to individual opinions.\n\nBut, he added, Mr Sunak was \"clear that stopping the boats, stopping the cruel cycle of vulnerable people being exploited by criminal gangs, is the fair and compassionate thing to do\".\n\nIf passed, the bill would place a legal duty on the government to detain and remove migrants arriving in the UK illegally, either to Rwanda or another \"safe\" third country.\n\nThe government has stressed it remains committed to its plan to remove migrants to Rwanda, and has said it will challenge a Court of Appeal ruling last week that this was unlawful.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr Sunak told the Liaison Committee of senior MPs the government's case would be made in the Supreme Court \"confidently and vigorously\".\n\nIn the first six months of 2023, 11,434 people were detected making the journey from France, according to provisional Home Office figures.\n\nThe June total of 3,824 was the highest since records began in 2018. In June last year, 3,140 migrants arrived in the UK after crossing the Channel.\n\nDespite the record June number, the total for the first half of the year was 10% lower than for January-June 2022 (12,747).\n\nIn January, Mr Sunak set out five pledges which he said would address \"the people's priorities\", including passing new laws to stop Channel crossings. But he did not put a timescale on achieving the promise.\n\nLast month, he insisted his plan was \"starting to work\".\n\nLabour has accused the prime minister of chasing \"short-term headlines instead of doing the hard work needed to tackle the problem\".\n\nShadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: \"The numbers of dangerous crossings are rising again, hotel costs are spiralling, all while the government's flagship Rwanda policy unravels in front of their eyes.\"\n\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.", "The Greek Air Force has released footage of a helicopter crew winching survivors to safety after a fishing boat carrying hundreds of migrants capsized off the coast of southern Greece.

We had permission\".\n\nGermany has now ended its rescue mission, after airlifting more than 700 people to safety on six flights from the airfield north of Khartoum which the UK is now using for its evacuation operation.\n\nAround 200 of those taken to safety were German nationals and the rest were from 30 other nations, including the UK.\n\nThe relief and elation in Berlin that its operation concluded relatively successfully has assuaged the anger of defence officials, but military leaders are still said to be \"not amused\".\n\nWhen asked why the UK had managed to get its embassy staff out on Saturday, while German flights only started on Sunday, Mr Pistorius said: \"How shall I put it diplomatically? They ignored what the Sudanese had stipulated.\"\n\nAnd, in Berlin, there are lingering traces of disdain for the UK government's initial handling of the crisis.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock may not have mentioned the UK by name but launched a thinly disguised attack on countries that, she implied, had abandoned their citizens and focused their rescue efforts only on diplomatic staff.\n\n\"It was important to us that the [German] evacuation, unlike other countries, didn't just involve our diplomatic personnel but all Germans on the ground and their partners.\"", "Empire Cinemas has collapsed into administration with the immediate loss of 150 jobs.\n\nSix cinemas in the chain have closed, with a further eight under threat.\n\nAdministrators BDO said the impact of the Covid pandemic and the cost of living crisis had \"significantly affected the companies' business\".\n\nLast month rival chain Cineworld, also fell into administration, hit by the pandemic and competition from streaming.\n\nThe Empire cinemas that closed on Friday are in Bishop's Stortford, Catterick Garrison, Sunderland, Swindon, Walthamstow and Wigan.\n\nThe closures leave Sunderland and Wigan with no main cinema.\n\nMeanwhile, the remaining sites in Birmingham, Clydebank, High Wycombe, Ipswich and Sutton, and the two Tivoli-branded venues in Bath and Cheltenham, will continue to trade as the administrators look for a buyer.\n\nStaff apparently turned up for work at branches on Friday to find notes on windows explaining they were closing down, according to local media reports.\n\nBDO said the cinemas employed a total of 437 staff across England and Scotland.\n\nIt said gift cards, ticket e-codes, guest passes and readmission tickets will continue to be valid at trading cinema sites.

No-one who provided those services in the UK has been investigated or fined.\n\nFor a time Gulnara Karimova was tipped to succeed her father, Islam Karimov, who ruled Uzbekistan as president of the central Asian state from 1989 until his death in 2016. She appeared in pop videos under the stage name \"Googoosha\", ran a jewellery company and served as ambassador to Spain.\n\nBut then in 2014 she disappeared from public view. It later emerged she had been detained on corruption charges while her father was still in power and she was sentenced in December 2017. In 2019 she was sent to prison for breaching the terms of her house arrest.\n\nProsecutors accused her of being part of a criminal group that controlled assets of more than $1bn (\u00a3760m) in 12 countries, including the UK, Russia and United Arab Emirates. \"The Karimova case is one of the largest bribery and corruption cases of all time,\" says Tom Mayne, one of the researchers on the Freedom For Eurasia report and a research fellow at the University of Oxford.\n\nHowever, Karimova and her associates had already sold some of the property allegedly acquired with corrupt funds.\n\nFreedom For Eurasia researched property and land registry records to identify at least 14 properties it says were purchased before she was arrested, with allegedly suspicious funds, in various countries, including the UK, Switzerland, France, Dubai and Hong Kong.\n\nThe report to be published on Tuesday 14 March, titled Who Enabled the Uzbek Princess?, focuses on five properties bought in and around London, now worth an estimated \u00a350m - including three flats in Belgravia, just west of Buckingham Palace, a house in Mayfair and an \u00a318m Surrey manor house with a private boating lake.\n\nTwo of the Belgravia flats were sold in 2013 before Karimova was detained. In 2017, the house in Mayfair, the Surrey mansion and a third flat in Belgravia were frozen by the Serious Fraud Office.\n\nFreedom For Eurasia's report also names firms in London and the British Virgin Islands that it claims were used by Karimova or associates to enable them to spend the proceeds of crime on the properties as well as on a private jetliner.\n\nKarimova's boyfriend, Rustam Madumarov, and others now alleged to be associates of hers were listed in official documents as the \"beneficial owners\" - a legal term for the person who ultimately is in control - of companies based in the UK, Gibraltar and the British Virgin Islands. But the report says they were just proxies for Karimova, who used the firms to launder hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nAccountancy services for two UK companies linked to Karimova - Panally Ltd and Odenton Management Ltd - were provided by SH Landes LLP, a firm formerly located on New Oxford Street in London.\n\nIn late July 2010, SH Landes sought to register or acquire another company. The aim was to purchase a private jet for around $40m (\u00a333m), with Madumarov named as the beneficial owner. In fact, according to the report, Karimova was really behind the purchase.\n\nKarimova's former property in Mayfair, London, was seized by the Serious Fraud Office\n\nWhen asked at the time about the source of his funds, SH Landes replied: \"We believe that the question regarding his personal wealth is not relevant in this situation.\" This was seemingly because the money to buy the jet was not being provided by Madumarov out of his personal funds.\n\nThe London-based firm later said Madumarov's wealth came partly from a mobile phone company based in Uzbekistan, Uzdonrobita. Questions had already been raised about the company's possible links to Karimova. As far back as 2004, an article for the Moscow Times had alleged that Karimova siphoned some $20m out of Uzdunrobita using fraudulent invoices. A former adviser had also accused Karimova of \"racketeering\".\n\nBecause it was a high-value transaction linked to a high-risk jurisdiction, Uzbekistan, the report argues that SH Landes should have conducted \"enhanced due diligence\" - thorough background checks to ensure the source of funds was legitimate and not derived from criminal activity.\n\nSH Landes also submitted the 2012 financial statements for Panally Ltd. The report says in September 2013 they were signed off by a close associate of Karimova's: Gayane Avakyan, then aged 30.\n\nThe previous year, the BBC had published allegations that Avakyan was the registered beneficial owner of Takilant, a Gibraltar-registered company at the centre of \"a high-level multi-million dollar fraud and corruption scandal in Uzbekistan\".\n\nIn a statement to the BBC, Steven Landes said: \"SH Landes LLP was never engaged by Gulnara Karimova. SH Landes LLP did act on behalf of Rustam Madumarov.\n\n\"SH Landes LLP obtained due diligence on all its clients and relevant regulatory authorities were notified and kept appraised.\"\n\nTom Mayne of Freedom For Eurasia said the apparent ease with which Karimova managed to buy so much UK property was concerning.\n\n\"It took the authorities until 2017 to do anything, years after other countries had already frozen bank accounts and properties that belonged to her,\" he added.", "Last updated on .From the section Tennis\n\nCoverage: Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. More coverage details\n\nAndy Murray's hopes of a fine Wimbledon victory on the 10th anniversary of his 2013 title win were ended by fifth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas in round two.\n\nStalled by Wimbledon's 11pm curfew on Thursday, the Briton lost 7-6 (7-3) 6-7 (2-7) 4-6 7-6 (7-3) 6-4 on Friday.\n\nShortly before Murray's loss, British number one Cameron Norrie fell 3-6 6-3 2-6 6-7 (3-7) to Christopher Eubanks.\n\nBritish number five Liam Broady lost 4-6 6-2 7-5 7-5 to Canadian 26th seed Denis Shapovalov in the third round.\n\nDefeats for the trio ended British interest in the men's draw and dampened the spirits of the home fans at the All England Club.\n\nTheir exits leave British women's number one Katie Boulter as the only remaining home player in the singles.\n\nOn Saturday, Boulter has the chance to reach the fourth round for the first time when she plays defending champion Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan.\n\u2022 None Murray unsure he has motivation for Wimbledon\n\nMurray pushes one of the best but falls agonisingly short\n\nMurray is a two-time champion at Wimbledon, having also won in 2016, and had talked positively about his chances of going deep in the draw.\n\nA poor performance at Queen's in the build-up to the tournament saw him miss out on a seeding, leaving him vulnerable to a tough test early on.\n\nEven after the draw threw up the possibility of facing 24-year-old Tsitsipas, Murray insisted he had the ability and nous to cause anybody problems on the SW19 grass.\n\nAgainst one of the top players in the men's game, he was proven correct.\n\nOn Thursday, Murray grew into a contest played indoors under the floodlights and moved ahead just before the match was halted at 22:39 BST.\n\nUnlike the other Grand Slams, Wimbledon has a 23:00 curfew which has been imposed by the local council.\n\nThe end of the set felt like the natural moment to pause, coming at a time which seemed to suit both players.\n\nWhen they returned, now playing outdoors on a hot summer afternoon, the pair continued to dominate on serve.\n\nHowever, at 4-4 15-30, Murray missed a chance to challenge a line call which would have been successfully overturned and could have altered the trajectory of the match.\n\nThere was a sense of inevitability that the set would go to the tie-break and, when it did, Tsitsipas kept his composure to clinically level.\n\nUnderneath bright skies, the mood further darkened among the home fans at the start of the decider.\n\nMurray's serve came under severe pressure in the third game. A slice into the net by the Scot was followed by a beautifully-judged lob from Tsitsipas, before a double fault created three break opportunities.\n\nMurray was able to save two of them, but a forehand into the net handed over an advantage from which he could not recover.\n\nThe level of performance Tsitsipas was forced to find in order to advance - and register by far his best win of the grass-court season on a tricky surface - was testament to Murray's challenge.\n\nMurray waved goodbye as he received a standing ovation from Centre Court and, though he knows there will not be many opportunities to play there again in the future, he showed he is far from done.\n\nWhich player would benefit from the overnight break - Murray after a painful looking fall, or Tsitsipas after momentum swung away from him - was debatable.\n\nThe delay did provide the opportunity for the romantics to dream.\n\nMurray returned on Friday aiming to earn his biggest win by ranking since the 2013 final, 10 years to the day and at the scene of the defining moment of his career.\n\nThe realists felt the pause might suit Tsitsipas better - and were vindicated.\n\nThe 2021 French Open finalist and 2023 Australian Open runner-up produced another serving masterclass, like he did in the first two sets on Thursday, and did not face a break point as he turned around the deficit.\n\nAsked if the 18-hour gap benefitted him, Tsitsipas said: \"It did not help me that much. You are dealing with a lot of things.\n\n\"You are dealing with Andy Murray at the other side of the net. He can make it a marathon and I had to work extra hard.\n\n\"My legs are sore - he made me run left and right, up and down for how many hours.\"\n\nNorrie and Broady out as British men's hopes end\n\nNorrie, 27, reached the Wimbledon semi-finals last year but his bid to replicate that run came unstuck against an inspired Eubanks.\n\nOn Court One, 12th seed Norrie struggled to make a dent on the American's serve and lost four of the 13 break points he faced.\n\nEubanks described grass as the \"stupidest surface\" in a text exchange with former women's world number one Kim Clijsters earlier this summer, but won an ATP title in Mallorca last week after receiving advice from the Belgian.\n\nThe world number 43 looked confident from the start against Norrie, who said he could not cope with his opponent hitting \"absolute rockets\".\n\n\"I got outplayed.

These targets are supposed to rapidly cut the greenhouse gas emissions that warm our planet's atmosphere.\n\n\"There is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all,\" the report states.\n\nGovernments had previously agreed to act to avoid global temperature rise going above 1.5C. But the world has already warmed by 1.1C and now experts say that it is likely to breach 1.5C in the 2030s.\n\nThe UK government responded that the report makes it clear that countries must \"work towards far more ambitious climate commitments\" ahead of the UN climate summit COP28 in November.\n\n\"The UK is a world leader in working towards net zero, but we need to go further and faster,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nSmall islands in the Pacific are some of the countries expected to be worst hit by climate change.\n\nResponding to the report, the chair of the Alliance of Small Island States Fatumanava-o-Upolu III Dr. Pa'olelei Luteru said: \"While our people are being displaced from their homes and climate commitments go unmet, the fossil fuel industry is enjoying billions in profits. There can be no excuses for this continued lack of action.\"\n\nThe report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - the scientific body that advises the UN on rising temperatures - is agreed on by all governments involved.\n\nTheir new study aims to boil down to one slim volume several landmark findings on the causes, impacts and solutions to climate change that have been released since 2018.\n\nIt outlines the significant impacts that climate change is having on the world already, and explains that these will get much worse.\n\nBy 2100 extreme coastal flooding that used to happen once-a-century is expected to occur at least annually in half of the world's tidal gauge locations - places where sea level recordings are made.\n\nConcentrations of the warming gas CO2 in the atmosphere are at their highest in 2 million years. The world is now warmer than at any time in the past 125,000 years - and will likely get warmer still over the next decade.\n\n\"Even in the near term, global warming is more likely than not to reach 1.5C even under the very low greenhouse gas scenario,\" the report states.\n\n\"If we aim for 1.5C and achieve 1.6C, that is still much much better than saying, it's too late, and we are doomed and I'm not even trying,\" Dr Friederike Otto, from Imperial College, a member of the core writing team for this report, told BBC News.\n\n\"And I think what this report shows very, very clearly is there is so much to win by trying.\"\n\nThe synthesis shows that projected emissions of CO2 from existing fossil fuel infrastructure, such as oil wells and gas pipelines, would bust the remaining carbon budget - the amount of CO2 that can still be emitted - for staying under this key temperature threshold.\n\nAnd while not explicitly mentioning new projects like Willow oil in the US or the Cumbria coal mine in the UK, the scientists involved have few doubts about their impact.\n\n\"There's not a cut-off day (for fossil fuels), but it's clear that the fossil fuel infrastructure we already have will blow through that carbon budget,\" Dr Oliver Geden, from the German Institute for International and Security Affairs and a member of the report's core writing team, told BBC News.\n\nWorld-leading scientists wrote the UN report which must also be agreed on by governments\n\n\"The remaining carbon budget in opening new fossil fuel infrastructure is certainly not compatible with the 1.5C target.\"\n\nThe document argues strongly that going past 1.5C will not be the end of the world as this may only be a \"temporary overshoot\".\n\nThe authors say that they are optimistic that dramatic changes can be achieved rapidly, pointing to the massive falls in the price of energy made from solar and wind.\n\nThey also argue that changes driven by consumers in terms of diet, food waste and switching to low carbon transport can achieve significant cuts in emissions from many sectors.\n\nBut the report also acknowledges that in addition to getting to net zero emissions as soon as possible, large scale use of carbon dioxide removal technology will be needed.\n\nSome observers have their doubts. \"We know what needs to happen, but the carbon removal part and carbon capture and storage ideas are a massive distraction,\" said Lili Fuhr, from the Centre for International Environmental Law, who attended the approval session.\n\nResponding to the report's call for more urgent action, the UN secretary general is calling for countries to bring forward their plans for net zero by a decade.\n\n\"Leaders of developed countries must commit to reaching net zero as close as possible to 2040, the limit they should all aim to respect,\" he said in a statement. He also calls on the likes of India and China who have announced net zero plans for beyond 2050 to try and bring them forward by a decade as well.", "The first full-sized digital scan of the Titanic, which lies 3,800m (12,500ft) down in the Atlantic, has been created using deep-sea mapping.\n\nRead more: Scans of Titanic reveal wreck as never seen before", "Kate Forbes, who finished second to Humza Yousaf in the SNP leadership race, has announced that she is leaving the Scottish government.\n\nScotland's finance secretary was on maternity leave after the birth of her daughter when Nicola Sturgeon suddenly announced that she was quitting as SNP leader and Scotland's first minister.\n\nWithin a couple of days of confirming she would be standing in the contest to succeed her, Ms Forbes found herself at the centre of a political storm.\n\nHer views on issues such as gay marriage, abortion, trans rights and having children outside of marriage were savaged by Deputy First Minister John Swinney, who had been standing in for the deeply religious Ms Forbes since last July.\n\nMs Sturgeon herself also made thinly-veiled barbs at the woman she had appointed finance secretary at the age of 29, just hours before she had to deliver a budget speech.\n\nScotland is a progressive country, Ms Sturgeon stated, and the views of the next first minister therefore matter.\n\nMs Forbes saw several supporters desert her campaign in response to the furore, which was ignited when she told journalists that she would not have voted for gay marriage had she been an MSP at the time.\n\nShe subsequently told Sky News that she believed that having children outside of marriage is \"wrong\" according to her faith as a member of the evangelical Free Church of Scotland, while stressing that: \"In a free society you can do what you want.\"\n\nMs Forbes has never hidden her religious beliefs, leaving pundits wondering why they had appeared to come as a shock to some of her supporters.\n\nThe Free Church, of which she is a devout follower, has strongly opposed gay marriage since it was legalised in Scotland in 2014.\n\nMs Forbes and her husband Ali celebrated the birth of daughter Naomi last year\n\nIn 2018, Ms Forbes spoke at the National Prayer Breakfast for Scotland a day after a Westminster debate on abortion, when she called on politicians to \"recognise that the way we treat the most vulnerable - whether the unborn or the terminally ill - is a measure of true progress\".\n\nShe was among the 15 SNP politicians who wrote an open letter to Ms Sturgeon the following year asking for a delay to gender recognition reforms that would allow people in Scotland to self-identify their sex.\n\nThe final vote on the proposals was held when Ms Forbes was on maternity leave, but when she launched her leadership campaign she made clear that she still had significant concerns about self-identification and would not have been able to vote for the legislation in its current form.\n\nSeveral senior figures within the Scottish government reacted with fury to her comments, with Mr Swinney saying he profoundly disagreed with her views despite also having deep Christian faith.\n\nHumza Yousaf warned that independence could only be won if the SNP sticks to \"progressive values\" and avoids a \"lurch to the right\".\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThe bubbling tensions boiled over in a televised STV debate, when Ms Forbes launched an attack on Mr Yousaf in which she slated his performance as a government minister.\n\nMs Forbes told Mr Yousaf: \"You were transport minister and the trains were never on time, when you were justice secretary the police were stretched to breaking point, and now as health minister we've got record high waiting times.\n\n\"What makes you think you can do a better job as first minister?\"\n\nMs Forbes presumably did little to endear herself to the SNP hierarchy watching at home - although Ms Sturgeon says she didn't tune in for the debate - when she declared that it was time for a new generation to lead the party and that \"more of the same is not a manifesto - it is an acceptance of mediocrity\".\n\nThe remark could be read as a dig at Mr Yousaf, who to some extent pitched himself as the \"continuity candidate\", and the record of Ms Sturgeon herself.\n\nShe later doubled down by saying she would potentially have space for Mr Yousaf in her cabinet if she won the contest - but not as health secretary.\n\nMs Forbes was born in Dingwall in the Highlands, but was partly raised in India as her parents travelled there twice as missionaries, the first time when she was four years old.\n\nHer parents are reported to have been members of the more liberal Church of Scotland, with Ms Forbes claiming that she had chosen to join the Free Church after returning from India as it was \"just down the road\".\n\nMs Forbes (centre) had two spells in India during her childhood\n\nShe went to a Gaelic school while in Scotland and became a fluent speaker of the language as a child.\n\nWhen she returned to India at the age of 10, she studied at Woodstock School - an international residential school in the foothills of the Himalayas.\n\nShe went on to complete degrees at Cambridge University and Edinburgh University and became a chartered accountant for Barclays in London.\n\nShe worked as an assistant to the SNP MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch, Dave Thompson, for two years before being selected to replace him when he stood down.\n\nOn the backbenches, the then 26-year-old campaigned to ban plastic straws and delivered a speech in the Holyrood chamber entirely in Gaelic.\n\nIn 2018 she entered government as public finance minister working alongside Derek Mackay, who she would go on to succeed as finance secretary when he was forced to stand down just hours before delivering his budget speech after it emerged he had sent inappropriate text messages to a 16-year-old schoolboy.\n\nMs Forbes became Scotland's first female finance secretary and was widely praised for delivering the budget speech with just a few hours' notice, having only received the call from Ms Sturgeon at 7am that morning.\n\nShe has said the SNP needs to win over No voters by using the Scottish Parliament's existing powers to show that Scotland can flourish if it is to secure independence.\n\nMs Forbes had only a few hours to prepare for a budget speech after being appointed to the finance brief\n\nMs Forbes told the Guardian: \"We keep holding ourselves as hostages to fortune by setting a timetable rather than by focusing on what is really going to shift the dial.\n\n\"So day one, I would start the campaign for independence. But I would do that through gentle persuasion, making the economic case and earning people's trust back. The more successful and effective we are at that, the shorter the timetable becomes.\"\n\nShe has said she would not raise income tax for higher earners and would instead focus on growing the economy and expanding the tax base by cutting red tape for businesses, improving transport infrastructure and having a \"cautious\" transition away from North Sea oil and gas.\n\nMs Forbes has also described the government's bottle return scheme as well-intentioned but \"badly executed\".\n\nDuring a Channel 4 debate, presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy told Ms Forbes that her views on taxation and economic growth sounded \"a bit like Liz Truss\".\n\nThe three candidates were Ash Regan, Humza Yousaf and Kate Forbes\n\nLittle of this would be popular with the Scottish Greens, whose power-sharing deal with the SNP would have been very unlikely to survive under Ms Forbes - particularly because of her views on social issues.\n\nThe SNP's social justice secretary, Shona Robison, said she would have to think long and hard about whether she would serve in government under Ms Forbes, while the party's deputy leader at Westminster, Mhairi Black, warned of a possible split if the finance secretary had won the leadership.\n\nSeveral of her colleagues were said to have been furious over her attack on Mr Yousaf's record, which they believe will be quoted repeatedly by opposition parties as they seek to attack the SNP's record in government.\n\nThe Scottish Conservatives have already said they want to use Ms Forbes' remarks in their next party political broadcast.", "Deaths of mental-health in-patients are to be examined as part of the national investigation\n\nA national investigation into mental-health inpatient services in England has been announced by the government.\n\nIt will examine how trusts can learn from deaths in their care, how to improve young people's care and patients being treated far from home.\n\nThere has been huge concern recently over deaths of mental-health inpatients.\n\nCharities welcomed the move, saying patients, families and carers must be closely involved.\n\nIt comes as an inquiry investigating deaths of mental-health patients in Essex has been given extra powers, and upgraded into a full public inquiry, to compel witnesses to give evidence.\n\nThe national investigation will start in October, when the Health Services Safety Investigations Body (HSSIB) is formally set up.\n\nIt will have the power to fine those who refuse to give evidence when they are required to do so.\n\nA number of issues will be looked at, in both NHS and private services, including:\n\nHSSIB chief investigator Rosie Benneyworth said any evidence would be kept anonymous.\n\n\"It is crucial that those impacted by poor care and those working on the front lines of the inpatient settings can share their experiences, reassured that HSSIB will use this information to improve care and not apportion blame or liability,\" she said.\n\nSpeaking in the House of Commons earlier, Health Secretary Steve Barclay said the investigation body would \"have teeth and work at speed\".\n\nRethink Mental Illness chief executive Mark Winstanley said there had been \"appalling failures\" in the standard of care delivered to people at their most vulnerable.\n\nHe said the investigation must have powers to issue alerts to improve patient safety but the government must also address \"the staffing crisis\" in mental health services.\n\n\"We believe that only if the government prioritises and urgently acts on these factors, can we prevent more avoidable tragedies and pave the way towards improved, safer care in mental-health inpatient units.\"\n\nMental-health charity Mind chief executive Sarah Hughes called the announcement \"a crucial step in tackling the serious concerns we have about the state of mental health inpatient care in England\".\n\n\"It is testament to the families who have fought for change because of the suffering their loved ones have endured in mental-health hospitals,\" she added.\n\nThe government has also published the findings of an independent rapid review into mental-health inpatient settings.\n\nIt heard from more than 300 mental-health experts, including carers, nurses, psychiatrists and patients, to determine how data could identify risks to patient safety in mental-health inpatient settings.\n\nGeraldine Strathdee, who chaired the review, said she had been surprised how much of a burden data put on staff.\n\n\"Some clinicians reported spending half or more of their time entering data, taking time away from face-to-face therapeutic treatment and care of patients,\" she said.", "The Ukrainian leader was in Saudi Arabia ahead of an expected trip to the G7 in Japan\n\nVolodymyr Zelensky has accused some Arab leaders of \"turning a blind eye\" to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, ahead of his trip to the G7 in Japan.\n\nThe Ukrainian president made the comments while attending an Arab League summit in Saudi Arabia on Friday.\n\nOf the Arab League nations, only Syria has openly supported Russia's invasion. Others have sought to maintain good relations with Moscow.\n\nBut some states must reflect on their ties with Russia, Mr Zelensky said.\n\n\"Unfortunately, there are some in the world and here among you who turn a blind eye to those [prisoner of war] cages and illegal annexations,\" said Mr Zelensky.\n\n\"I'm here so that everyone can take an honest look, no matter how hard the Russians try to influence, there must still be independence.\"\n\nMr Zelensky also told the assembled leaders in Jeddah that his country was defending itself from colonisers and imperialists, appearing to invoke the Arab world's own history of invasion and occupation.\n\nHost nation Saudi Arabia has walked a delicate line on the conflict - on the one hand supporting a UN resolution calling for Russia to withdraw its troops and pledging $400m in humanitarian aid to Ukraine, while on the other hand resisting imposing sanctions on Russia, preferring to see itself as neutral on the conflict.\n\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman renewed his offer for Saudi Arabia to mediate between Moscow and Kyiv to end the fighting at the summit.\n\nSyria meanwhile has only just been readmitted to the Arab League - its leader Bashar al-Assad told the summit there was an historic opportunity for the region to reshape itself without foreign interference.\n\nMr Zelensky also took aim at Iran, which is not a member of the Arab League, for supplying Shahed drones to Russia. Iran denies supplying drones for the conflict.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader will travel from Saudi Arabia to the G7 summit on Sunday, Japan confirmed on Saturday morning. Officials said he will take part in the summit's leaders' session and take part in a bilateral meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.\n\nEarlier, Mr Zelensky's office also told Ukrainian media that he would meet with US President Joe Biden \"in the next few days\" in Japan.\n\nThe summit kicked off on Friday with a renewed condemnation of Russia and an announcement of further sanctions.\n\nThe group of seven nations, made up of the US, UK, France, Italy, Germany, Canada and Japan, represent the world's richest democracies. This year, eight other countries including Australia and India have also been invited.\n\nG7 leaders slapped more sanctions on Russia on the summit's opening day\n\nThe trip to Japan will be the furthest Mr Zelensky has travelled from Kyiv since the war began in February 2022.\n\nIn the past few days Mr Zelensky has visited Italy, Germany, France and the UK, where he nailed down promises of military support. He also continues to push allies to provide advanced fighter jets to Ukraine, but so far no country has committed to directly providing them.\n\nOnce he reaches Hiroshima he will probably try to persuade more cautious leaders to provide aid, such as Mr Kishida and Indian leader Narendra Modi.\n\n\"By showing up in person, it is a chance for him to ensure he does not come away empty-handed, and that he will head back to Kyiv his arms full with the weapons deals that he wants\", including a promise of lethal weapons from Japan, said John Kirton, director of the G7 Research Group think tank.\n\nThough Japan has been hugely sympathetic to Ukraine, its strict military laws have meant that so far it has only given non-lethal defence equipment.\n\nEarlier on Friday, G7 leaders were welcomed by Mr Kishida at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park where they laid wreaths to honour those who died in the US atomic bombing which hastened the end of World War Two.\n\nThe summit's first day ended with a statement in which member countries pledged \"new steps\" to stop the war in Ukraine and promised further sanctions to \"increase the costs to Russia and those who are supporting its war effort\".\n\nThey said they would \"starve Russia of G7 technology, industrial equipment and services that support its war machine\" and limit Russia's revenue from energy and diamond sales.\n\nSeparately, British PM Rishi Sunak told the BBC the UK would sanction the Russian diamond industry, and would target more people and companies connected to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nIn response to what it termed \"anti-Russian\" US sanctions, the Russian foreign ministry announced its own set of sanctions on 500 US citizens, including former US President Barack Obama.\n\nThe G7 summit, which ends on Sunday, is expected to end with a communique on the war in Ukraine.", "A book about the menopause by TV presenter Davina McCall has scooped the top prize at the British Book Awards.\n\nMenopausing, by McCall and Dr Naomi Potter, was named overall book of the year.\n\nThe so-called \"Davina effect\" saw a huge increase in demand for hormone replacement therapy (HRT) after a Channel 4 documentary on the subject.\n\nNovelist Sir Salman Rushdie was also honoured, nine months after being attacked on stage in New York.\n\nMcCall and Potter's Menopausing was praised by a panel of judges which included Channel 4 newsreader Krishnan Guru-Murthy, broadcaster Anita Rani, and DJ Vick Hope.\n\nSix months after publication, it continues to rank highly in the bestseller charts.\n\nGuru-Murthy said the book had helped to start a national conversation about menopause.\n\nHe said the broadcaster and the menopause doctor had produced an authoritative and entertaining book about \"an important and ignored subject\".\n\nLong Lost Family presenter McCall said she was \"walking on air\" after the award was announced.\n\n\"We are so so grateful to everyone that contributed...

Four women reveal the shock of it happening to them.", "Finley Boden was 10 months old when he was murdered on Christmas Day in 2020\n\nKey documents which led to a court agreeing to return a 10-month-old boy to his parents, who then murdered him, have been obtained by the BBC.\n\nFinley Boden was killed on Christmas Day 2020, 39 days after he was returned to their care. He had 130 injuries.\n\nThe papers from the family court hearing, conducted by phone during the Covid pandemic, were released after a media application to the High Court.\n\nShannon Marsden and Stephen Boden are due to be sentenced on Friday.\n\nThe documents are significant as they informed the crucial hearing about Finley's future - led by two family magistrates.\n\nThe papers were released to the BBC, the PA Media news agency and the Daily Telegraph after a request following the couple's conviction.\n\nThe submissions help establish what happened between Finley being removed from his parents a few days after his birth on 15 February, to the decision to return him to their full-time care by 23 November.\n\nAfter the boy was born, social workers from Derbyshire County Council had decided to remove him from his parents who were living in Chesterfield. The authority believed he was likely to suffer \"significant harm\" at home - the legal threshold in care cases.\n\nThey said Shannon Marsden and Stephen Boden were living in squalor - their home was filthy and smelled of cannabis. They described the terraced house as \"very unclean\" and \"at times hazardous, with faeces on the floor\".\n\nThe social workers also said there was a risk of domestic violence, because in the past police had been called during an argument and Stephen Boden had a previous conviction for domestic violence against an ex-partner. Both parents smoked \"between medium and high\" levels of cannabis.\n\nBut over the next six months, the couple persuaded social workers they had made positive changes - aided by Covid restrictions, which limited physical interactions with others.\n\nDuring the 2020 spring lockdown, social workers were not routinely going into homes. In Finley's case, photos were instead sent by his mother which showed her terraced home looking clean and tidy.\n\nA photo of Finley's clean and tidy bedroom, submitted to social workers by Shannon Marsden, before he was returned\n\nBy the summer, some Covid restrictions had eased and the parents could meet Finley in person again. Some sessions were overseen by social worker Lynn Williams, who assessed them as she tried to help them become better parents.\n\nThe report she submitted to the court for the 1 October hearing is among the documents disclosed to us.\n\nIn it, she noted that on one occasion, when the weather was warm, \"Shannon Marsden ensured Finley was in the shade\". The social worker also noted the mother had held his hand when he was in the pushchair - which she described as \"a natural response from a caring parent\".\n\nShe said Stephen Boden had interacted with his son \"by talking to him and making him smile\".\n\nIn August, Ms Williams said she had visited the couple at home, noting that the fridge was well-stocked and the bathroom clean. On a follow-up visit that same month, she observed the house was still relatively tidy and the parents seemed keen to keep it so.\n\nBut Ms Williams' generally positive report was undermined by drug tests taken by both parents as directed by children's services. Marsden told social workers she had given up cannabis in October 2019, but tests of her hair indicated that was not the case between February and August 2020. Tests found Boden had used cannabis too.\n\nA police photograph of Finley's bedroom after his death showing \"filthy conditions\", including a baby milk bottle covered in mould\n\nIn the papers presented to the court for the 1 October hearing, the local authority said Finley should return gradually to his parents' care through a \"transition plan\" over about four months. It proposed that at first, Finley would stay with his carers and only see his parents during the day - initially for an hour and a half, building up to five hours. Then he would be able to stay on a Saturday night.\n\nThe amount of time he could spend with his parents would then increase further - so that by mid-January 2021 he would be in their full-time care. This gradual process was to ensure his time with his parents could be monitored - to make sure he was safe.\n\nBut Marsden and Boden wanted Finley back more quickly. In his statement submitted to the October hearing, Boden said: \"Shannon and I have worked really hard to make changes.\" Marsden admitted she had been using cannabis but said she had been \"given the incentive to quit completely\".\n\nIn care cases like Finley's, the child's guardian can be one of the most influential voices. They are employed by Cafcass, the independent Children and Families Court Advisory Service, and their role is to represent the child's best interests.\n\nFinley's guardian, Amanda O'Rourke, had only been able to see him once, via a WhatsApp video call, while he was with his carers. He was a \"smiler\", she wrote in her report for the court, who liked to \"blow raspberry's\" (sic).\n\nShe acknowledged the squalor, drug use and domestic violence in the parents' past. Her report said she agreed in principle with a transition plan, but said it should take place much faster, given the parents had \"clearly made and sustained positive changes\".\n\nMs O'Rourke's report to the magistrates said he should go back to their full-time care \"within a six to eight week period,\" half the time requested by the local authority.\n\nA statement from Cafcass said: \"It is not possible to say whether a longer transition plan would have prevented Finley's death. What led to his death was the ability of his parents to deceive everyone involved about their love for him and their desire to care for him.\"\n\nStephen Boden and Shannon Marsden were convicted of murder in April - they will be sentenced on Friday\n\nThe 1 October hearing took place in the period between Covid lockdowns - in England at the time, gatherings were restricted to six people and many courts were working remotely.\n\nIn cases like Finley's, parents would normally be in court but, because of the pandemic, everyone was on the phone. Marsden and Boden did not speak at all.\n\nThe final decision was made by two magistrates, Kathy Gallimore and Susan Burns, assisted by a legal adviser. That is because magistrates are not legal experts.\n\nThe barrister for the local authority argued the Cafcass guardian's plan would send Finley back home \"too soon\". He said Covid had disrupted the baby's regular contact with his parents and this needed to be rebuilt. He also said the parents should be tested for drugs as they had been \"dishonest\" about their cannabis use.\n\nBut the barrister for Finley's Cafcass guardian said it was not in the boy's interests for the \"rehabilitation plan\" to be drawn out for such a long period. She said she was \"neutral\" on the question of drug testing.\n\nThe court's legal adviser said drug testing could be ordered if it was \"necessary, imperative and vital to the running of the case\".\n\nIn their judgement that afternoon, Mrs Burns and Mrs Gallimore supported the Cafcass guardian's view - that an eight-week transition was \"a reasonable and proportionate\" length of time which would protect Finley's welfare. They did not order further drug tests of his parents.\n\nThere is no suggestion that the magistrates made a mistake in law.\n\nAnd later - when the High Court agreed to release these documents - Justice Nathalie Lieven described the family court as having made a \"reasonable decision\".\n\n\"Having read the papers here, I have every sympathy with the decision the magistrates made,\" she said.\n\nA child safeguarding review into the circumstances surrounding Finley's death is currently ongoing\n\nChesterfield MP, Labour's Toby Perkins, is now calling for a further inquiry into Derbyshire's children's services. He also says it is \"deeply significant\" that this case was heard by magistrates.\n\n\"It is legitimate to question that entire process, whether the care required for Finley Boden's safety was preserved by that process,\" he told the BBC.\n\nSince these documents were given to the BBC, Derbyshire County Council has said the author of the independent safeguarding review commissioned by the Derby and Derbyshire Safeguarding Children Partnership into Finley's death would consider the information in the paperwork \"to help form the partnership's learning findings and recommendations\".\n\nIt added in a statement: \"We remain fully engaged with the statutory legal review process which looks in depth at the role of all agencies following the death of a child.\"\n\nThe new timetable for Finley's return - decided on 1 October 2020 - meant he would stay overnight with his parents during the first week of transition. But by 23 November, he was living with them full-time.\n\nFour days later, social worker Emiley Hollindale was the last professional to see Finley alive. But, when she visited Boden and Marsden's home, no-one responded to her knocks. Peering through the window she could see Finley alone, asleep on the sofa.\n\nJust over a month later, the little boy was dead, in a once-more squalid house, reeking of cannabis.\n\u2022 None Parents murdered baby placed back into their care", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nVladimir Putin has said he will discuss Xi Jinping's 12-point plan to \"settle the acute crisis in Ukraine\", during a highly anticipated visit to Moscow by the Chinese president.\n\n\"We're always open for a negotiation process,\" Mr Putin said, as the leaders called each other \"dear friend\".\n\nChina released a plan to end the war last month - it includes \"ceasing hostilities\" and resuming peace talks.\n\nBut on Friday the US warned the peace plan could be a \"stalling tactic\".\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said: \"The world should not be fooled by any tactical move by Russia, supported by China or any other country, to freeze the war on its own terms.\"\n\nHe added: \"Calling for a ceasefire that does not include the removal of Russian forces from Ukrainian territory would effectively be supporting the ratification of Russian conquest.\"\n\nChina's plan did not specifically say that Russia must withdraw from Ukraine - which Ukraine has insisted as a precondition for any talks.\n\nInstead, it talked of \"respecting the sovereignty of all countries\", adding that \"all parties must stay rational and exercise restraint\" and \"gradually de-escalate the situation\".\n\nThe plan also condemned the usage of \"unilateral sanctions\" - seen as a veiled criticism of Ukraine's allies in the West.\n\nOn Monday, a military band gave Mr Xi a warm welcome to Moscow. Mr Putin hailed China for \"observing the principles of justice\" and pushing for \"undivided security for every country\".\n\nIn return, Mr Xi told Mr Putin: \"Under your strong leadership, Russia has made great strides in its prosperous development.

Russian and Chinese delegations will hold talks on Tuesday - the main day of the visit.\n\nThe meeting comes days after the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for the Russian president over war crime allegations.\n\nThis means Mr Putin could technically be arrested in 123 countries - though neither China nor Russia are on that list.\n\nMaking a trip to Moscow so soon after the ICC's announcement suggests China feels \"no responsibility to hold the Kremlin accountable\" for atrocities in Ukraine, Mr Blinken said.\n\nWestern leaders have been attempting since last February to isolate Russia, following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBut they have been unable to establish a global consensus, with China, India and several African nations reluctant to condemn Mr Putin.", "A lawsuit filed by Tiger Woods' ex-girlfriend claims he tricked her into packing a bag and leaving their shared home before locking her out.\n\nLawyers for Erica Herman, who began dating the golfer in 2017, argue she is owed $30m (\u00a325m) due to the way she was suddenly evicted from the house.\n\nIn a separate lawsuit, she wants a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) she signed with Mr Woods to be cancelled.\n\nA representative for Mr Woods, 47, did not immediately comment.\n\nThe couple's break-up has not been formally announced.

Common sense and friendship led us to suggest a postponement.\"\n\nThe UK government added the decision had been \"taken with the consent of all parties\". Mr Macron said France had proposed moving the trip to early summer, \"when things calm down again\".\n\nThe King and Queen Consort, pictured in Bolton in January\n\nThe decision is a significant loss of face for France and for President Macron. This was supposed to have been a showcase for France, introducing the new monarch to the best of French life and cementing a newly awakened friendship.\n\nThe president's opponents on the left and right reacted fast.\n\nEric Ciotti of the Republicans said the cancellation brought \"shame on our country\" while Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon on the far left was delighted the \"meeting of kings at Versailles\" had been broken up, adding that \"the English\" knew that France's interior minister was \"pathetic on security\".\n\nThe protests had made the trip impossible. Several French cities saw violence on the sidelines of Thursday's largely peaceful demonstrations that attracted more than a million people.\n\nThe entrance to the town hall in Bordeaux was set alight. In Paris, tear gas was fired and Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin said 903 fires were lit, in a city where refuse has been left uncollected since 6 March.\n\nHundreds of police officers were hurt across France, but protesters were injured by stun grenades and the Council of Europe said there was no justification for \"excessive force\" by authorities.\n\nFor much of Friday morning, French officials had sought to reassure the public that the state visit, from 26 to 29 March, would go ahead and that security was in place. Some UK journalists had already travelled to Paris to cover the event.\n\nThis was a hugely important trip for the King: a first state visit, and to one of the UK's closest and oldest allies. The King and Camilla were due to ride along the Champs-Elys\u00e9es in the heart of Paris and have a banquet at Versailles with President Macron.\n\nCamilla was expected to open an art exhibition at one of the main Paris attractions, the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay. They were then expected to head to Bordeaux.\n\nBut every step of the visit was at risk of being targeted by protests and eventually it was cancelled. Even the people who roll out the red carpets were planning strike action.\n\nInterior Minister Mr Darmanin said earlier on Friday that there were \"no known threats\" to the King. Bordeaux Mayor Pierre Hurmic said the trip to his city had been adapted so it \"can go ahead under the best security, so as not to expose the King to the slightest difficulty\".\n\nHowever, facing the prospect of showing the King through rubbish and graffiti-strewn streets, with every public appearance smothered in security, and every movement threatened by strikes, the French president made the obvious choice.\n\nIt may have been a joint decision with the UK government, but he was the one under pressure.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Dining with a king in Versailles would have been jarringly inappropriate and could have played rather too directly into the hands of his detractors.\n\nA TV interview that President Macron gave on the eve of Thursday's national action appeared to galvanise protesters, when he described the government's reforms as an economic necessity, saying he was prepared to accept the resulting unpopularity.\n\nHis government decided on Monday to force through the reforms, which raise the pension age from 62 to 64 and extend contributions by workers to 43 years.\n\nAs the president and prime minister realised they would struggle to pass the law in the National Assembly, they resorted to a constitutional power to bypass a vote.\n\n\"I listened to Macron yesterday and it was as if someone was spitting in our face,\" said Ad\u00e8le, a 19-year-old law student in Nanterre. \"For this pension reform, there is another way and if he doesn't do that, it's because he's not listening to the people.

He had previously described press reports about the membership numbers as \"inaccurate\" and \"drivel\".\n\nHowever, an NEC source told the BBC Mr Foote had been \"thrown under the bus\" by Mr Murrell.\n\nThe party this week confirmed there had been a big drop in membership numbers.\n\nSpeaking on BBC Scotland's The Sunday Show, Mr Russell said the SNP was \"basically a good party\" but things had gone \"spectacularly wrong in recent weeks\".\n\nHe said: \"I think it is fair to say there is a tremendous mess and we have to clear it up, and that's the task I'm trying to take on in the short term.\"\n\nPeter Murrell said he had become a distraction to the leadership race\n\nMr Russell said the most important thing now was that \"they have a fair electoral process that produces a clear accepted outcome\".\n\n\"We have got to have this concluded in the next eight days and then... the new leader has to look at the party and say let's rebuild this and let's rebuild the trust of Scotland.\"\n\nHe added: \"This has not been an edifying process. There hasn't been a contested leadership in the SNP for 19 years, and it shows.\"\n\nMr Russell said he did not know that the SNP membership numbers had dropped by about a third over about two years, and said he did not know if it was related to the controversial Gender Recognition Reform bill.\n\n\"We were losing members and we were losing members that we should have known about, absolutely,\" he said.\n\n\"We were clearly not told about that.

However while it has said the column fell \"short of its high editorial standards and should not have been published\" it has not accepted that it breached the editor's code, saying concerns raised were a \"matter of taste and judgement\".\n\nNevertheless after investigating the article, Ipso ruled the newspaper had indeed broken its editors' code of practice as the piece contained a \"pejorative and prejudicial reference\" to Meghan's sex.\n\nThe watchdog rejected complaints that the piece was discriminatory on the grounds of race, inaccurate or sought to harass the duchess.\n\nIn the column, Clarkson wrote that he was \"dreaming of the day when [Meghan] is made to parade naked through the streets of every town in Britain while crowds chant, 'Shame!' and throw lumps of excrement at her\".\n\nHe later explained that he had been thinking of a scene in Game of Thrones, but wrote the column in a hurry and forgot to mention the TV show.\n\nThe Sun has published a summary of the regulator's findings on the same page as the column usually appears, as well as running it on the front page of their website.\n\nElsewhere in the column, Clarkson wrote that he hated Meghan \"on a cellular level\".\n\nClarkson compared his hatred of the duchess with his feelings towards former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and serial killer Rose West. The regulator found this comparison was because all three are female.\n\nIpso's chief executive, Charlotte Dewar, told the BBC the regulator had considered complaints from gender equality charity The Fawcett Society and The Wilde Foundation, a charity that helps victims and survivors of abuse.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex dismissed apologies from Clarkson and The Sun\n\nShe said the remedy for this breach was the publication of Ipso's decision for Sun readers and also for the wider public to know the reasons for the finding adding, they had conducted a \"fair, independent, impartial and thorough investigation\".\n\nShe confirmed the complaints about the article had not come from the duchess.\n\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday, Ms Dewar said some complainants had felt passages had \"racial connotations\" but IPSO had not established these references were discriminatory.\n\nAsked if it mattered if the Sun had not accepted that there was a breach of the editors' code, Ms Dewar said: \"What matters to many people is that they did immediately remove the article very shortly after publication and they have apologised and accepted it should not have happened.\"\n\nShe said the complaint had been upheld and the finding meant the paper was required to look at the processes that led to the article.\n\nResponded to Ipso's ruling, the Sun said: \"Half of the Sun's readers are women and we have a very long and proud history of campaigning for women which has changed the lives of many.\"\n\nIt acknowledged Ipso ruled that Clarkson's column \"contained a pejorative and prejudicial reference to the duchess's sex\".\n\nBut it added the regulator had not upheld separate elements of the complaint - that the article was inaccurate, harassed the duchess or included discriminatory references on the grounds of race.\n\nThe BBC has contacted Prince Harry and Meghan for comment, along with Clarkson.\n\n\"This was a particularly egregious example of media misogyny, and our case was that the language in it and the tropes that Jeremy Clarkson used added up to sexism and discrimination against Meghan Markle that was harmful to her,\" she told the BBC.\n\nShe called for an investigation into how these \"toxic comments\" made it on to the pages \"of one of our biggest newspapers\".\n\nSenior Labour MP Harriet Harman, the society's incoming chairwoman, called Ipso's ruling \"a big step forward for women in the battle against sexism in the media\".\n\nClarkson has said that when he read the article in the paper, he realised he had \"completely messed up\".\n\nIn January he said he had emailed the couple over Christmas 2022 to tell them \"the language I'd used in my column was disgraceful and that I was profoundly sorry\".\n\nThe Sun as well as deleting the column from its website said at the time that it was \"sincerely sorry\".\n\nHowever, Harry and Meghan's spokesperson dismissed that apology, accusing the paper of profiting and exploiting \"hate, violence and misogyny\".\n\n\"A true apology would be a shift in their coverage and ethical standards for all,\" they said.\n\nThe article attracted the highest number of complaints since Ipso was established in 2014.", "Finley Boden was 10 months old when he was murdered on Christmas Day in 2020\n\nThe parents of a 10-month-old boy have been convicted of murdering him - 39 days after he was placed back into their care.\n\nStephen Boden and partner Shannon Marsden killed Finley Boden, who died on Christmas Day in 2020.\n\nFinley was found to have suffered 130 \"appalling\" injuries.\n\nA jury found the pair, from Chesterfield, Derbyshire, guilty of murder following a trial at Derby Crown Court on Friday.\n\nThey will be sentenced on 26 May.\n\nStephen Boden and Shannon Marsden were convicted at Derby Crown Court\n\nThe couple were responsible for what the court heard was the \"savage and brutal\" murder of their son after burning and beating him in repeated acts of violence.\n\nFinley's injuries included 57 breaks to his bones, 71 bruises and two burns on his left hand - one \"from a hot, flat surface\", the other probably \"from a cigarette lighter flame\".\n\nHe collapsed after suffering a cardiac arrest at the family's \"cluttered\" and filthy terraced home in Holland Road, Old Whittington - with faeces later found in the bedroom.\n\nParamedics were called there in the early hours of Christmas Day and Finley was taken to hospital, where he was later pronounced dead.\n\nWhen the verdicts were read out, Stephen Boden and Shannon Marsden showed no reaction.\n\nJudge Mrs Justice Amanda Tipples held back tears as she addressed the jury and thanked them for their \"extremely impressive\" conduct throughout the trial.\n\nAs she spoke, at least four jury members were in tears, and all were excused from taking part in jury service again for life, due to the distressing nature of the case.\n\nFinley, pictured on 30 November 2020, less than four weeks before he was killed\n\nChild protection concerns meant Finley was taken from his parents shortly after he was born in February 2020.\n\nBut later that year, he was returned to their care through a court order following an eight-week transition, despite social workers asking for a six-month period.\n\nThe court heard the pair worked together to keep professionals away from Finley to protect each other and to cover up serious violence.\n\nThis included cancelling a health visitor appointment two days before he died and telling social services when they arrived unannounced that Finley may have Covid-19 and refusing to let them in.\n\nA child safeguarding review into the circumstances surrounding Finley's death is currently under way.\n\nA spokeswoman for Derbyshire County Council said it would be \"fully engaged\" with the independent review, adding it would \"not be appropriate\" to comment further until it was complete.\n\nPolice described the conditions Finley was living in as \"filthy\"\n\nThe court heard both Boden, 30, and Marsden, 22, were regular and heavy users of cannabis, who prioritised getting money to spend on the drug over their son's care.\n\nToxicology tests showed cannabis was found in Finley's blood, indicating that he must have inhaled smoke in the 24 hours before his death, the court was told.\n\nThe court was shown text messages sent from the couple's shared mobile phone - with jurors told the author of each message was not always clear.\n\nIn one message to a contact saved as \"Smokey J\" at 12:39 GMT on 23 December 2020, the author said the \"little one\" had \"kept me up all night\".\n\nThe message added: \"I want to bounce him off the walls. Haha.\"\n\nPolice documented the state of the home Finley was living in as part of their investigation\n\nAfter Finley died, Boden was heard telling Marsden at hospital he was going to sell Finley's pushchair \"on eBay\" - but later told police he only said it \"in an effort to lighten the mood\".\n\nProsecutor Mary Prior KC said Boden later told a relative that Finley had been crying, so \"in his words, he 'shook him a little bit'\".\n\nBut she added Marsden, visiting Finley's body in a hospital chapel of rest on 11 January 2021, said: \"His dad's battered him to death. I didn't protect him.\"\n\nBoden had claimed the family dog may have \"jumped on\" his son, inflicting broken ribs, while a tear to the inside of Finley's mouth - likely caused by a dummy being rammed in - was blamed on the child hitting himself with a rattle.\n\nA child safeguarding review into the circumstances surrounding Finley's death is currently under way\n\nDet Insp Stephen Shaw, who led the police investigation, said: \"Finley Boden died in what should have been the safest place in the world for him - his own home.\n\n\"No verdict or jail sentence will bring Finley back, however, we now know the truth of what happened to him, and justice has been delivered.\"\n\nSuch tragedies almost defy comprehension but it may shock people to learn that the most likely age to be murdered in England and Wales is in the very first year of life.\n\nOn average 20 children under one are the victims of homicide each year. Each death results in an official review of what went wrong and then, as anguish over cases builds, a formal inquiry is launched.\n\nThree such inquiries into children's social care in England reported back last year. All three came to similar conclusions - the system needed a radical overhaul.\n\nTwo months ago, the government responded - agreeing that children's social care did need a \"major reset\".\n\nA consultation document was published by the Department for Education in February entitled 'Stable Homes, Built on Love'. It wrote of the need for phased reform, laying foundations, setting the direction for change, bringing forward new legislation subject to parliamentary time.\n\nCritics noted the \u00a3200m investment promised over the next two years is just a fifth of the billion pounds the government-commissioned inquiry into child social care in England had recommended. Some professionals lamented the lengthy timescale for reform.\n\nThere is general agreement that what is needed is effective multi-agency support for vulnerable children and their families. Inquiries have been trying to achieve that for decades.\n\nThis awful case adds to the anguish at society's inability to protect its most defenceless citizens.\n\nSir Peter Wanless, chief executive of the NSPCC, added: \"It is deeply harrowing and difficult to comprehend the suffering that Finley experienced leading up to his death, inflicted by the very people who should have been caring for him and protecting him from harm.\n\n\"The death of a child in such brutal circumstances leaves many of us asking questions and we await the child safeguarding practice review to provide answers as soon as possible.\"\n\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, or on Instagram.

Adam Price apologised last week but said the damning report points to a \"collective failure\" across the party\n\nMr Gruffydd's appointment as interim leader was agreed at a meeting of the party's Senedd members on Thursday and will need to be rubber-stamped by Plaid Cymru's National Council on Saturday.\n\nHe will not stand in the forthcoming leadership contest\n\nMr Gruffydd said he was \"grateful to the Plaid Cymru Senedd group\" for the nomination and thanked Mr Price for his \"vision, commitment, and dedication\".\n\nPlaid Cymru is the third largest party in the Welsh Parliament, with 12 Members of the Senedd and three MPs in Westminster.\n\nThe pro-independence party is in a co-operation agreement with the Welsh Labour government, which means they help them govern.\n\nMr Price was elected party leader in 2018, when he ousted Leanne Wood.\n\nWelsh Conservative leader, Andrew RT Davies, said: \"I have no doubt Adam Price's departure is a moment of personal sadness for him.\n\n\"Following the recent report into the culture within their party, it became clear Plaid Cymru politicians no longer had confidence in his leadership, so his departure became inevitable.\"\n\nFor the converted, the die-hard believers, it wasn't meant to be like this.\n\nAdam Price was touted by many in Plaid Cymru as a \"once in a generation\" politician who could overcome the party's many electoral barriers.\n\nWhen he challenged his predecessor for the leadership in 2018, he said only he could \"create the momentum\" Plaid needed to become Wales' main party of government and install him as first minister.\n\nAnd yet, there was no great advance at the following Senedd election - Plaid remains in third place behind the Welsh Conservatives.\n\nSupporters will say it was an election like no other, one focused almost entirely on the public's broadly favourable opinion of the Welsh Labour government's handling of the pandemic.\n\nIt is clear, though, that some of the sheen had faded and in terms of public support, the party remains no further forward under Adam Price's leadership.\n\nAs it nears its 100th birthday celebrations, Plaid Cymru will seek its 11th leader with many of the perennial questions about its purpose, its lack of reach beyond the heartlands and its relationship with Welsh Labour likely to be raised.\n\nBut it is the drip, drip of negative stories over the last year, culminating in a damning report that found a toxic culture within the party that meant Adam Price's position was no longer tenable.\n\nAddressing those major issues will be his successor's primary focus.\n\nSince last year Plaid Cymru has been dogged by claims of a toxic culture in the party, and it emerged last November that an allegation of sexual assault had been made against a senior member of staff.\n\nSeparately, a serious allegation was also made about the conduct of a Member of the Senedd, Rhys ab Owen, who is now suspended from the Senedd group pending an investigation.\n\nThe party asked Nerys Evans, a lobbyist and former Plaid assembly member, to hold a review last December.\n\nHer working group's report said Plaid needed to \"detoxify a culture of harassment, bullying and misogyny\".\n\nIt said too many instances of bad behaviour were tolerated, and said an anonymous survey of staff and elected members highlighted examples \"of sexual harassment, bullying and discrimination\".\n\nMr Price admitted the document left Plaid Cymru \"harmed and tarnished\". He apologised, but refused to quit.\n\nIn his resignation letter, Mr Price said: \"On receiving the report, I informed you that I felt morally bound to step down as leader of the party in recognition of our collective failure.\"\n\n\"You counselled against my resignation as you felt it would make it more difficult to achieve progress in implementing the recommendations.\"\n\nHe said he was \"persuaded by the argument that my stepping down would be an abdication of responsibility\".\n\nBut he added: \"It is now clear I no longer have the united support of my colleagues that would be necessary to follow this course to fruition.\"\n\nMr Drakeford said: \"I want to thank Adam Price for the constructive way the Welsh government and Plaid Cymru have worked together to develop and implement the co-operation agreement.

Focus on union after 'difficult week' for DUP - Robinson\n\nUpheaval in the DUP over the resignation of Jeffrey Donaldson as party leader should not deflect unionism from the task ahead, Gavin Robinson has said.\n\nThe interim DUP leader was speaking almost a week on from being installed in the role.\n\nSir Jeffrey resigned as party leader on Friday after being charged with rape and other historical sexual offences.\n\nHe has said he will strenuously contest the allegations.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr Robinson - who is also the East Belfast MP - said he had been engaging with colleagues over the last number of days and that the past week had been \"incredibly difficult and shocking\".\n\nBut he said the news \"should not deflect from the important task we have ahead of us as representatives for unionism and for Northern Ireland\".\n\n\"Let me assure you that our focus is undiminished on making sure our place in the UK is as strong as it can be, recognising the importance associated with the restoration of devolution,\" he said.\n\nMr Robinson said there were \"no mixed messages\" about support for him within the party.\n\nHowever, when asked whether there was unity about the deal the party signed up to that restored Stormont, he said that work continued.\n\nHe also criticised those he claimed sought to use events of the past week \"to sow discord for party political purposes\".\n\nHe added that in the coming weeks, there would be internal discussions about the leadership of the party - the deputy leader position is now vacant.\n\nMr Robinson had held it since last June before taking over as interim leader.\n\nHe said it was an internal matter and that the party would not be \"inviting introspection or encouraging disharmony where there is none\".\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, MP Carla Lockhart said there were no \"dissenting voices\" challenging Mr Robinson's installation.\n\nMs Lockhart, who is the MP for Upper Bann, said the revelations had come as a \"big shock\".\n\nShe also said whether Sir Jeffrey should stand down as MP Lagan Valley was \"for him to decide\".\n\nMs Lockhart added her voice to support for Mr Robinson and said there would be \"no leadership challenges\".\n\n\"Gavin has the support of the entire party, Gavin will do an excellent job,\" she said.\n\nMr Robinson had been deputy leader of the party since last June, until he was installed as interim DUP leader on Friday.\n\nGavin Robinson, the Belfast East MP, is the DUP's new interim leader\n\nIt is understood he had the unanimous support of the party's officers, who decide major decisions and set policy.\n\nMs Lockhart is one of the party's officers, and said it was \"right\" the DUP had taken action and that the party was focused on delivering for Northern Ireland.\n\n\"But it is important we in no way put at risk the justice system and allow the PSNI to do their jobs,\" she added.\n\nThe MP also insisted that the DUP was a family and \"not about one person\" and that the party would go into the upcoming general election as a team.\n\n\"It is important we show unionist unity and unite unionism - that's what I'm about.\"\n\nOn Friday, the DUP said Sir Jeffrey had confirmed he had been charged with historical allegations and was stepping down as leader.\n\nThe party's officers suspended him from membership, pending the outcome of the case.\n\nSir Jeffrey's letter to the DUP said he would be strenuously contesting the charges.\n\nMeanwhile on Thursday, the police said they were investigating the contents of a social media post relating to the Sir Jeffrey Donaldson case.\n\nThe PSNI did not identify Sir Jeffrey, but said it had \"received a report relating to a post online and are examining the content to determine if any offences have been committed\".", "It will be easier to prosecute people for sharing so-called revenge porn after a change in the law in England and Wales.\n\nAmendments to the Online Safety Bill being tabled on Tuesday will remove the requirement for prosecutors to prove perpetrators intended to cause distress to secure a conviction.\n\nSharing deepfake porn is also being criminalised for the first time.\n\nBoth offences will be punishable by up to six months in prison.\n\nThis would rise to two years if intent to cause distress, alarm or humiliation, or to obtain sexual gratification could be proved.\n\nThose who share an image for sexual gratification could also be placed on the sex offenders' register.\n\n\"Revenge porn\" is sharing an intimate image without consent. \"Deepfake porn\" involves creating a fake explicit image or video of a person.\n\nRevenge porn was criminalised in 2015 but up until now prosecutors had to prove there was an intention to cause humiliation or distress.\n\nTV personality Georgia Harrison, whose ex-partner Stephen Bear was jailed earlier this year for posting intimate footage of her on his OnlyFans account, was among those to call for a change to the legislation.\n\nThe Love Island star said she was grateful for the support she had been given.\n\n\"The reforms to the law that have been passed today are going to go down in history as a turning point for generations to come and will bring peace of mind to so many victims who have reached out to me whilst also giving future victims the justice they deserve,\" she said.\n\nGeorgia Harrison said she felt \"vindicated\" when her ex-partner was jailed earlier this year for sharing a private video of them having sex\n\nThe government announced its intention to legislate last year, and the amendments are part of the Online Safety Bill, which is due to be voted on by MPs later this month before it becomes law.\n\nJustice Secretary Alex Chalk said: \"We are cracking down on abusers who share or manipulate intimate photos in order to hound or humiliate women and girls.\n\n\"Our changes will give police and prosecutors the powers they need to bring these cowards to justice, safeguarding women and girls from such vile abuse.\"\n\nDeepfakes have been increasing in recent years with a website that virtually strips women naked receiving 38 million hits in the first eight months of 2021.\n\nResearch shows one in seven women and one in nine men aged between 18 and 34 have experienced threats to share intimate images,.\n\nMore than 28,000 reports of disclosing private sexual images without consent were recorded by police between April 2015 and December 2021.\n\nThe overhaul of intimate image law builds on previous amendments.\n\nA detailed review by the Law Commission recommended reforming measures protecting against intimate image abuse.\n\nDomestic Abuse Commissioner Nicole Jacobs welcomed the news and said the changes would \"hold perpetrators to account for this insidious form of abuse\".\n\nShe said: \"Intimate image abuse causes significant distress to victims and survivors and often exists as part of a wider pattern of abuse that continues offline.\"\n\nRuth Davison, chief executive of the domestic abuse charity Refuge, pointed to the \"woefully low\" conviction rates for intimate image abuse.\n\n\"The amendments to the Online Safety Bill will make it easier to prosecute perpetrators of intimate image abuse, ensuring justice and better protections for survivors,\" she said.\n\nHowever, others have highlighted that more needs to be done to fully address image-based abuse.\n\nHonza \u010cervenka, a lawyer at McAllister Olivarius, said the changes were welcome but pointed out there were likely to be \"jurisdictional issues\".\n\n\"Some of these websites may not be easily traceable, others may be hosted in countries specifically chosen for their lax laws when it comes to online harm and harassment,\" he told the BBC.\n\n\"Very often, victims become aware of images resurfacing months or even years after their apparent takedown.\"\n\nRani Govender, senior child safety online policy officer at the NSPCC, said it was a positive move but big tech firms needed to be held more accountable for what was posted on their platforms.\n\n\"More needs to be done if the Online Safety Bill is to tackle the creation and sharing of child sexual abuse material which takes place on industrial levels,\" she said.\n\n\"The government should act today by closing a loophole in the legislation that will let tech bosses off the hook if they fail to address the way their products contribute to child sexual abuse.\"", "Hundreds of thousands of public sector workers have been taking part in strikes over pay\n\nRishi Sunak has said any pay offer to public sector workers had to be \"fair, affordable and responsible\" in order to control rising prices.\n\nThe PM said it would be \"short-sighted\" to do something now that made inflation worse in the longer term.\n\nTackling inflation meant taking \"difficult decisions\" that would benefit the country, he added.\n\nIt comes as he reportedly faces pressure from ministers to accept the recommendations of pay review bodies.\n\nThe Times reported that five Cabinet ministers were lobbying the prime minister to accept pay recommendations believed to centre on around 6%.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Selby, Yorkshire, on Saturday, Mr Sunak said \"no decisions have been made\" on whether to abide by the proposals.\n\n\"It would be incredibly short-sighted of the government to do something that might sound great today but ultimately just made

She has claimed to have had an affair with him before he was president.\n\nSeated at a table before Justice Juan Manuel Merchan, Mr Trump was joined by his team of legal heavy hitters including Todd Blanche (far left), a white-collar legal expert who has been tapped to be his lead counsel, according to Politico.\n\nSusan Necheles (second from left) is no stranger to the Trump Organisation. She was part of the legal team that defended the company and its chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg last year in a trial for tax fraud. Mr Weisselberg was convicted. She also once represented Genovese crime family underboss Venero \"Benny Eggs\" Mangano, according to Reuters.\n\nJoe Tacopina (second from right) has been a prominent figure in the weeks leading up to this arraignment, frequently speaking to media on behalf of the former president.

Mr Dorris left the dock in tears.\n\nThose who died were Dane Chinnery, Donald Collett, Robert Huxley, Philip Logan, Dorota Rynkiewicz, Philip Seary and Mark Smith.\n\nThe jury heard Mr Dorris was driving the tram at over 70km/h (43mph) - more than three times the limit - as he approached the curve near Sandilands.\n\nThe prosecution claimed Mr Dorris, from Beckenham, south-east London, may have had a \"micro-sleep\" while at the controls of the tram. He denied this, saying: \"It just went horribly wrong for me.\"\n\nDorota Rynkiewicz, Dane Chinnery, Donald Collett, Mark Smith, Phil Seary, Philip Logan and Robert Huxley were killed in the derailment\n\nHe told the trial that he had become \"confused\" and \"disorientated\" before the tram derailed but that he could not explain how it happened.\n\nWhile giving evidence, Mr Dorris broke down in tears as he described his final journey and told the victims' families he was \"deeply sorry\" for the crash.\n\nHe told them: \"I'm a human being and sometimes as a human being things happen to you that you are not in control of.\"\n\nMr Dorris blamed his confusion on a combination of external factors including poor lighting and signage in the Sandilands tunnel complex, darkness and bad weather.\n\nThe accident happened early on the morning of 9 November 2016\n\nHe told the jury he thought he was travelling in the opposite direction, but by the time he realised his mistake the tram was already tipping over and he was thrown from his seat, causing him to hit his head and pass out.\n\nMr Dorris also said he had suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder since the crash and had become estranged from his wife and daughter.\n\nSurvivors described being flung about as if in a washing machine or a pinball machine, then a moment of silence before people began to scream and shout.\n\nAt the crux of this case is where the weight of responsibility lay for the safety of tram passengers. Was it with the driver or was it actually on the tram operator and Transport for London (TfL) and the systems in place?\n\nThe defence maintained there were factors outside Alfred Dorris's control that made him disorientated. He denied he had ever fallen asleep at the controls.\n\nThere were a lack of visual cues in the tunnel, poorly maintained and broken lighting - many lights didn't work at all - and poor speed limit signage. The court heard there was \"an accident waiting to happen\" at the corner where the crash took place.\n\nThe driver became confused and thought he was going the opposite way and not into a tight corner. The jury decided that system errors were the issue, not the driver.\n\nSpeaking after the verdict, Joe Collett, whose brother Donald died in the derailment, said he felt the system had let him down and later broke down in tears.\n\n\"I'm very, very disappointed because the only one who knows what happened, the truth, is Mr Dorris,\" he said.\n\nJoe Collett, whose brother Donald died, said he did not believe justice had been done\n\n\"There's certain elements for example - that he'd done the journey several thousand times and this day said he had a bad day - but seven people had a worse day.\"\n\nHe continued by saying he didn't think justice had been done, adding: \"He's got to live with himself, he knows what he's done.\"\n\nMeanwhile Danielle Wynne, whose grandfather Philip Logan was killed in the crash, said it felt \"like someone stabbing me in the chest\".\n\n\"If I got into my car and I did what he did at the speed that he did, then I would go to prison.\"\n\nMs Wynne added: \"I don't believe that morning [Mr Dorris] set out to kill anyone. But he did kill people. There has to be some kind of accountability.\"\n\nLater outside court, Mr Dorris's lawyer Gary Rubin read a statement from his client in which he described the past seven years as \"difficult\".\n\nHe said: \"Unfortunately, that morning went horribly wrong and that was because of something I wasn't in control of.\n\n\"I am truly and deeply sorry - it's something that I am going to have to live with for the rest of my life, and I would just like to end by saying there are no winners in this case.\"\n\nIn July 2021, an inquest jury concluded that the deaths were accidental and the victims were not unlawfully killed.\n\nThe case against Mr Dorris was brought by the Office of Rail and Road (ORR), which said it \"conducted an extensive, detailed and thorough investigation\" into the derailment.\n\nThe ORR also prosecuted TfL and the tram operator Tram Operations Limited under health and safety laws.

Watch: 'They've taken my baby' - Mother of teen shot by police\n\nThe killing of Nahel M, 17, has sparked riots in cities across France as well as the town of Nanterre to the west of Paris where he grew up.\n\nAn only child brought up by his mother, he had been working as a takeaway delivery driver and played rugby league.\n\nHis education was described as chaotic. He was enrolled at a college in Suresnes not far from where he lived, to train to be an electrician.\n\nThose who knew Nahel, who was of Algerian descent, said he was well-loved in Nanterre where he lived with his mother Mounia and had apparently never known his father.\n\nHis record of attendance of college was poor. Nahel had been in trouble before and was known to police, but family lawyers stressed he had no criminal record.\n\nHe had given his mother a big kiss before she went to work, with the words \"I love you, Mum\".\n\nShortly after nine in the morning on Tuesday he was fatally shot in the chest, point-blank, at the wheel of a Mercedes car for driving off during a police traffic check. At 17 he was too young for a licence.\n\n\"What am I going to do now?\" asked his mother. \"I devoted everything to him,\" she said. \"I've only got one, I haven't got 10 [children]. He was my life, my best friend.\"\n\nHis grandmother spoke of him as a \"kind, good boy\".\n\n\"A refusal to stop doesn't give you a licence to kill,\" said Socialist Party leader Olivier Faure. \"All the children of the Republic have a right to justice.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nNahel had spent the past three years playing for the Pirates of Nanterre rugby club. He had been part of an integration programme for teenagers struggling in school, run by an association called Ovale Citoyen.\n\nThe programme was aimed at getting people from deprived areas into apprenticeships and Nahel was learning to be an electrician.\n\nOvale Citoyen president Jeff Puech was one of the adults locally who knew him best. He had seen him only a few days ago and spoke of a \"kid who used rugby to get by\".\n\n\"He was someone who had the will to fit in socially and professionally, not some kid who dealt in drugs or got fun out of juvenile crime,\" Mr Puech told Le Parisien.\n\nHe praised the teenager's \"exemplary attitude\", a far cry from what he condemned as a character assassination of him painted on social media.\n\nHe had got to know Nahel when he lived with his mother in the Vieux-Pont suburb of Nanterre before they moved to the Pablo Picasso estate.\n\nShortly after his death an ambulance man, Marouane, launched a tirade against a police officer, explaining later that he knew the boy as if he was his little brother. He had seen him grown up as a kind, helpful child. \"He never raised a hand to anyone and he was never violent,\" he told reporters.\n\nHis mother believes the police officer who shot him \"saw an Arab face, a little kid, and wanted to take his life\". She told France 5 TV she blamed only the one person who fired the shot, not the police: \"I have friends who are officers - they're with me wholeheartedly.\"\n\n\"May Allah grant him mercy,\" read a banner unfurled over the Paris ring road outside Parc des Princes stadium.\n\nFlowers were left at the site where Nahel died\n\n\"Police violence happens every day, especially if you're Arab or black,\" said one young man in another French city calling for justice for Nahel.\n\nBut the family's lawyer, Yassine Bouzrou, said this was not about racism, but about justice.\n\n\"We have a law and judicial system that protects police officers and it creates a culture of impunity in France,\" he told the BBC.\n\nNahel had been the subject of as many as five police checks since 2021 - what is known as a refus d'obtemp\u00e9rer - refusing to comply with an order to stop.\n\nWhen he was stopped by police, he was driving a Mercedes with Polish number plates, with two passengers and no licence.\n\nAs recently as last weekend, he had reportedly been placed in detention for refusing to comply and was due to appear before a juvenile court in September.\n\nHis name was on a police file called a Taj, used by authorities for a variety of investigations.\n\nLast September a judge imposed a \"disciplinary measure\". Most of the trouble he got into involved cars: driving without a licence or insurance and using false number plates.\n\nBut Nahel had never been convicted, said family lawyer Jennifer Cambla, and had no criminal record. Being known to police was not the same as a criminal record, because he had never been tried for anything listed on his police file, she told French TV.\n\n\"I think in this kind of suburb it's pretty rare that a young person hasn't been stopped by police or hasn't been in custody,\" Ms Cambla said.\n\nThe riots that his death has provoked are a reminder for many in France of the events of 2005, when two teenagers, Zyed Benna and Bouna Traor\u00e9, were electrocuted as they fled police after a game of football and ran into an electricity substation in the Paris suburb of Clichy-sous-Bois.\n\n\"It could have been me, it could have been my little brother,\" a Clichy teenager called Mohammed told French website Mediapart.", "South Wales Police is set to start reusing technology ruled unlawful in 2020\n\nCivil rights groups have claimed facial recognition technology will make racism within the police worse.\n\nSouth Wales Police is set to restart using the controversial technology after an independent review said it was not discriminatory.\n\nBut Liberty said history showed it would \"always be used disproportionately against communities of colour\".\n\nThe force insisted the technology would be used responsibly.\n\nLive facial recognition enables police to find people at big events suspected of committing crimes.\n\nIn 2020, appeal court judges ruled a trial project to scan thousands of faces by South Wales Police was unlawful.\n\nThe force had paused its use of the technology amid concerns over discrimination, but will resume in the wake of a report commissioned in conjunction with the Metropolitan Police.\n\nIt found there were minimal discrepancies for race and sex when the technology is used at certain settings.\n\nAn independent review said the technology was not discriminatory\n\nLiberty, which describes itself as \"the UK's largest civil liberties organisation,\" said the technology was oppressive and had no place in a democracy.\n\n\"Our ability to express ideas, communicate with others and engage in democratic processes will be undermined by technology such as facial recognition,\" said campaigns manager Emmanuelle Andrews.\n\n\"The expansion of mass surveillance tools has no place on the streets of a rights respecting democracy.\"\n\nSouth Wales Police chief constable Jeremy Vaughan said the study confirmed the software does not discriminate.\n\n\"We're not going to just stick cameras out and look for whoever we want to at any given point in time,\" he said.\n\n\"There's a proper list with careful thought about who's on that list.\"\n\nBut following a damning report about the Met and concerns about racism, misogyny and homophobia within Gwent Police, campaign groups said they have every right to be concerned.\n\n\"It entrenches patterns of discrimination and sows division.\n\n\"History tells us that surveillance technology will always be used disproportionately against communities of colour and those most marginalised in our society and at a time when racism in UK policing has rightly been highlighted.\n\n\"It's simply unjustifiable to use a technology that will make this even worse.\"\n\nThe force has previously demonstrated the technology with a member of staff\n\nRace Council Cymru's Molara Awen pointed to incidents where the technology has had \"difficulty identifying black faces\".\n\nShe said the decision had been made without the organisation being consulted.\n\n\"We know that the justice system does not work equally for black people as it does for white people,\" she added.\n\n\"We're all of a sudden supposed to just trust them?

The government and rail industry need to go back to the drawing board.\"\n\nThere have been threats of legal challenges from some disability campaigners, and from five Labour metro mayors.\n\nBut the train operating companies' body, the Rail Delivery Group, has consistently defended the proposals and the consultation.\n\nLast week its chief executive Jacqueline Starr told the BBC the industry was listening to accessibility groups' concerns and had taken part in a 'round table' with the rail minister.\n\nAsked if she could promise that every ticket would still be available from machines or online, including the cheapest, Ms Starr responded: \"I'm not going to make promises that I can't keep\".\n\nShe added that the industry would work hard to make sure vending machines did offer every ticket where possible.", "The Conservative Party is investigating its former Foreign Office Minister Sir Alan Duncan, after he attacked other party members over Israel.\n\nThe former MP told LBC the Conservative Friends of Israel group was \"doing the bidding\" of the Israeli prime minister.\n\nHe also called for two Tories linked to the group, Lord Polak and Lord Pickles, to be removed from the House of Lords.\n\nThe Campaign Against Antisemitism said he was \"invoking classic antisemitic tropes of Jewish power and disloyalty\".\n\nSir Alan, who stood down as an MP in 2019, said the Conservatives had not provided \"substantive grounds for their action\".\n\nHe had not been contacted by the party but had been \"told by many in the media that the Conservative Party has issued a statement to say that I am to be investigated by them with a view to expulsion\".\n\n\"If this is indeed their intention, I will probably be the only person ever to be reproached for upholding his party's policy and for defending the principles of international law and justice in the face of others who would undermine them,\" Sir Alan said.\n\n\"Should they choose to pursue this, they should not be surprised if it rebounds on them massively and proves dangerously harmful to their own reputation.\"\n\nIn an interview with LBC, Sir Alan criticised those in British politics who \"refuse to condemn settlements\" by Israel in the West Bank.\n\n\"The time has come to flush out those extremists in our own parliamentary politics,\" he said.\n\nThe Conservative Friends of Israel group was \"doing the bidding\" of Benjamin Netanyahu and \"bypassing all proper processes of government to exercise undue influence at the top of government\", Sir Alan said.\n\n\"What you have now is a lot of people sitting around Rishi Sunak who are giving him appalling advice.\n\n\"Let's start with the head of CFI -

Neither are coastguard and military vessels which do not have to share their location.\n\nThe overcrowded vessel was pictured a number of times before tragedy struck\n\nFrontex, the EU's border force, says it first spotted the migrant boat at around 08:00 GMT on Tuesday and informed the Greek authorities.\n\nAlarm Phone, an emergency hotline for migrants in trouble at sea, say they received a call at 12:17 GMT saying the boat was in distress.\n\nWe have used video and photographs authenticated by BBC Verify, as well as court records and shipping logs, to analyse the movement of vessels in the area in the following hours.\n\nThe Marine Traffic animation shows a ship called the Lucky Sailor abruptly turning north at 15:00 GMT.\n\nThe owner of the Lucky Sailor gave the BBC their timeline of events and confirmed it had been asked by the Coastguard to approach the migrant boat and give food and water.\n\nAbout half-an-hour later at 15:35 GMT, the coastguard helicopter found the migrant boat. Authorities have continued to claim it was on a steady course at the time.\n\nThe movement of ships in the area where the vessel eventually sank (in yellow) suggests it was stationary hours before the shipwreck\n\nBut two-and-a-half hours later at around 18:00 GMT, another vessel, the Faithful Warrior, travelled to the same area and also gave supplies to the boat.\n\nThe owners of Faithful Warrior referred us to the investigating authorities.\n\nVideo has emerged - reportedly shot from the Faithful Warrior - claiming to show supplies being delivered to the migrant ship via a rope in the water. No other ships can be seen.\n\nBBC Verify checked it and found the vessel - which is not moving in the footage - matched the shape of the migrant ship seen in photos and the weather conditions were a match for those reported at the time.

But few in the country, where nearly half the population relies on money from the government to help make ends meet, are making any backup plans.\n\nIn the base of a tower near the Brooklyn Bridge, half a dozen white-haired men and women assembled for their monthly book club.\n\nThe members are among the nearly 70 million Americans who receive monthly payments from Social Security, the government's assistance for pensioners and the disabled.\n\nThe programme pays out more than $115m (\u00a392m) each month - about $1,700 on average per person - support that is at risk if President Joe Biden and Republican leader Kevin McCarthy cannot reach a deal before the US runs out of money to pay its bills.\n\nAuthorities have warned that moment could arrive in less than two weeks.\n\nThe seniors at Southbridge Towers said they were following the talks - and feel worried. But asked if they had taken any precautions in case the US defaults and their Social Security benefits do not arrive, the seniors seated around the plastic table responded with a sea of blank looks.\n\n\"That will never happen,\" declared 82-year-old Norman Manning. \"It would be disastrous.\"\n\nMr Manning is hardly alone in betting that a deal allowing the US to borrow money will get done.\n\nFinancial markets also appear largely confident, despite some signs of anxiety among investors, including a drop in demand for some kinds of US debt.\n\nEven after the lead Republican negotiator last week walked out of a closed-door meeting with White House representatives during talks aimed at avoiding a default, shares only flinched.\n\nBut Ian Bremmer, president of political consultancy the Eurasia Group, warned that even if both sides can agree to a deal, it will probably take significant wrangling before Republicans in Congress will vote for it - which could push the US into risky territory.\n\n\"This is going to get worse before it gets fixed,\" he said.\n\nWithout a deal, the White House has warned that if the government defaults, there would be severe disruption to government functions as well as pay for pensioners, government employees and members of the military. Financial markets are expected to go haywire.\n\nAnalysts say a prolonged stand-off could spark an economic downturn on the scale of the 2008 financial crisis, when millions of people lost their jobs and trillions of dollars in wealth was wiped out in financial markets.\n\nA recent poll by Ipsos/Reuters found that three in four Americans fear personal financial fallout from such an event.\n\nBut dire predictions aside, no-one is exactly sure what would happen in a default - nor are government agencies providing many clues about if or how they are preparing.\n\nWhen asked if it had alerted Social Security recipients about the risks, the Social Security Administration referred questions to the Treasury Department. The Treasury Department did not respond to a request for comment.

She has now been suspended from the Commons, a move which is expected to trigger a by-election.\n\nAnother former SNP MP, Natalie McGarry, withdrew from the party whip in 2015 amid a police investigation into her finances.\n\nShe was sentenced to two years in jail for embezzling \u00a325,000 from the SNP and a pro-independence group.

It would, she said, require people to \"run government-mandated scanning services on their devices\".\n\nCiaran Martin, the former head of the National Cyber Security Centre, told Today that: \"Essentially it's building a door that doesn't currently exist, not into the encrypted messaging app but into devices, which could be used or misused by people who aren't interested in protecting children for more nefarious purposes.\"\n\nMr Martin said he believed the UK would end up in the \"unhappy situation\" where the power in the bill would be passed by Parliament but not used.\n\nApple tried client-side scanning, but abandoned it after a backlash. In an article in the Financial Times, Mr Martin suggested Apple is privately critical of the powers in the bill, but the firm has so far declined to set out publicly its position on the issue.\n\nBBC News learned from Freedom of Information requests that Apple has had four meetings since April 2022 with the Ofcom team responsible for developing policy regarding the enforcement of the relevant section of the bill.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Watch: 'This is such dramatic news' - Katie Razzall talks about Huw Edwards\n\nLast night's statements \"have acted like a dash of cold water to the face of all journalists,\" Craig Oliver, Huw Edwards' former boss on the Ten O'Clock News, said.\n\n\"I think that one of the things that's really come of this, is should news just slow down and allow the processes to take place, allow the facts to emerge and then report the story?,\" he told BBC's Radio 4 Today programme.\n\nThe story has raised \"much bigger issues for journalism,\" former ITN chief executive Stewart Purvis also told the programme.\n\n\"In what circumstances is it legitimate for a news organisation to investigate and report on the private life of somebody with a high public profile?,\" he asked.\n\nEdwards has worked for the BBC since the mid-1980s, rising from a trainee position to becoming one of BBC News' most recognisable presenters.\n\nAs well as hosting the Ten O'Clock News on television, he has led coverage of major news events, such as elections and the death of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nThe initial allegations, first reported on Friday, were that the presenter paid a young person for explicit photos, beginning when they were 17.\n\nThe paper's source was the mother and step-father of the young person - but a letter issued on the young person's behalf by a lawyer described their account as \"rubbish\".\n\nSouth Wales Police previously said it had told the young person's family there was no criminal wrongdoing after being approached prior to their complaint to the BBC and account to the Sun.\n\nIn another statement on Wednesday, the force said it had recently carried out further inquiries and had found \"no evidence that any criminal offences have been committed\".\n\nOn Tuesday, the BBC published an investigation after speaking to an individual in their 20s who said they said were sent abusive and menacing messages by the presenter.\n\nThe Sun then published another story claiming the presenter broke Covid lockdown rules in February 2021 to meet a 23-year-old he had met on a dating site, and sent what they described as \"quite pressurising\" messages.\n\nThe newspaper also published what it says is an Instagram chat between the presenter and a 17-year-old, where the presenter sent messages including love heart emojis.\n\nThe BBC has not been able to verify these messages.\n\nA spokesperson for the Sun said the newspaper has no plans to publish further allegations about Edwards and will co-operate with the BBC's internal investigation process.\n\nA statement read: \"The allegations published by the Sun were always very serious. Further serious allegations have emerged in the past few days...\n\n\"The Sun will cooperate with the BBC's internal investigation process. We will provide the BBC team with a confidential and redacted dossier containing serious and wide-ranging allegations which we have received, including some from BBC personnel.\"\n\nThe Sun's statement said it had not accused Edwards of criminality in its original front page story.\n\nThe newspaper had reported Edwards had paid the person for pictures when they were 17 - but it did not explain such actions could be an offence. Under-18s are classed as children in the law covering sexual images. This is higher than the age of sexual consent, which is 16.\n\nIn later versions of the story, the Sun changed the wording of this allegation to \"it is understood contact between the two started when the youngster was 17\".\n\nDespite allegations emerging publicly and being widely discussed, media outlets - including BBC News - initially took the decision not to name the presenter due to privacy concerns.\n\nHave you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

While theoretically a marriage of equals, one partner, it seemed, could not leave without the other's consent.\n\nMs Sturgeon had run out of road and she knew it.\n\nAfter briefly flirting with the idea of treating the next general election as a referendum in all but name, she announced her resignation less than three months after the court ruling.\n\nHer departure marks the end of a remarkable career as a political campaigner.\n\n\"Eight election victories in eight years as first minister, that's the verdict that matters to me,\" said Ms Sturgeon in her 286th and final session of First Minister's Question Time on Thursday.\n\nTriumphs in three general elections, two Holyrood elections, two local government elections, and a European parliamentary election are impressive for sure - but, unusually for a political party, winning elections to enact policies in government is not actually the central mission of the SNP.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Nicola Sturgeon addresses the Holyrood chamber for the last time as first minister\n\nOn the binary measure of independence, Ms Sturgeon, like Alex Salmond before her, leaves office as a failure. Scotland remains in the United Kingdom.\n\nShe began campaigning for independence as a teenager in 1980s Ayrshire and was just 21 when she first stood for election, unsuccessfully challenging Labour in the working class Glasgow Shettleston constituency under the SNP slogan \"Free by '93\".\n\nThirty years on, the SNP has made great strides towards its goal but Ms Sturgeon's resignation implicitly acknowledges that Scotland will not be \"free\" by '23, or any time soon after.\n\nThe abrupt announcement of her departure set in train a damaging and divisive leadership contest, with splits emerging on economic and social issues as well as on electoral and constitutional strategy.\n\nDiscipline, for which the SNP had been famed, began to crumble.\n\nEven contenders for Ms Sturgeon's crown publicly criticised the lack of progress on independence during her eight years in office.\n\nHumza Yousaf, Kate Forbes and Ash Regan are competing to become the next SNP leader\n\n\"For too many years, we've become the party of referendums rather than the party of independence,\" said Finance Secretary Kate Forbes, who promises to \"turn a divided nation into a settled majority\" for leaving the UK.\n\nAccording to former minister Ash Regan: \"The SNP has lost its way. There's been no progress on independence in the last few years, despite the worst UK governments of all time.\"\n\n\"I think what we are now hearing publicly is what many people have been saying privately for a long time,\" says James Mitchell, professor of public policy at Edinburgh University.\n\nThe SNP's looming crisis deepened when the party admitted that it had covered up a dramatic fall in its membership, prompting the resignations of director of communications, Murray Foote, and chief executive Peter Murrell, who is married to Ms Sturgeon.\n\nAlso following his wife out of government are two of her most trusted lieutenants, senior adviser Liz Lloyd and Deputy First Minister John Swinney.\n\nIt has been a chaotic and painful few weeks for the SNP and yet the final days of the first minister's tenure have been characterised by boosterism and denial.\n\n\"The SNP's not in a mess,\" Ms Sturgeon insisted on ITV's Loose Women. \"It's going through, how can I put this, some growing pains right now.\"\n\nThen there was her denial that SNP president Mike Russell had said the party was in a mess.\n\nMr Russell had answered the question \"Is your party in turmoil?\" with the words: \"Well, I think it's fair to say that there's a tremendous mess and we have to clear it up.\"\n\nMs Sturgeon also insisted that her party had not lied to journalists about its plummeting membership figures despite evidence to the contrary, not least the resignations of Mr Foote and Mr Murrell.\n\nThe whole membership affair was, leadership contender and Health Secretary Humza Yousaf told Tuesday's Times Radio debate, a \"total own goal\".\n\nSo, is Nicola Sturgeon's dream of a sovereign Scottish state, standing tall on the world stage, dead and buried?\n\nHistory says don't be so sure.\n\nOn the day the Hollywood epic Braveheart had its American premiere in Seattle, a more peaceful political drama was playing out on the streets of the old country.\n\nThe death of the Conservative MP for Perth and Kinross had triggered a by-election, and the SNP candidate Roseanna Cunningham was on the march - and under attack.\n\nA senior Tory accused Ms Cunningham - caricatured as Republican Rose because she opposed the monarchy - of fighting a campaign \"against Queen and country\".\n\nAt 18 years old, I was easily the least experienced journalist on the by-election trail - but even I could see that the Tories were in trouble in territory which they had dominated for decades.\n\nTheir candidate, a gaffe-prone merchant banker, was keen to talk about one topic above all others, campaigning (literally) under the banner: \"A Strong Union\".\n\nYou could understand why. The spoils of Empire; the unifying experience of defying Hitler's Germany; and the creation of the welfare state had all bound Scotland tightly into the union.\n\nRoseanna Cunningham (centre) put independence at the heart of her by-election campaign in 1995\n\nMargaret Thatcher's response, as Conservative prime minister during the 1980s, was to fight and win a war abroad while hastening a profound economic shift at home.\n\nHer vision of a modern British economy meant moving away from state subsidy of heavy industry; weakening the trade unions; and encouraging the creation of wealth through private enterprise.\n\nFor many in Scotland, where culture, tradition and pride were intertwined with coal, steel and textiles, the pace of change was bewildering.\n\nA lack of direct and obvious benefit from the vast quantities of oil being sucked out of the North Sea also contributed to a rise in nationalist sentiment.\n\nBy the time of the Perth and Kinross by-election, Scotland was rediscovering an old identity.\n\nWhen it premiered in Stirling that autumn, Braveheart's romanticisation of the wars of independence from England in the 13th and 14th Centuries seemed in tune with the mood of the moment.\n\nHaving placed independence front and centre in her campaign, Ms Cunningham won handsomely, further reducing Tory Prime Minister John Major's slender majority in the House of Commons.\n\n\"Scotland is waking from its slumber,\" proclaimed the victorious new MP during a feisty and raucous declaration in the city hall.\n\nWas it though? The SNP had scored spectacular by-election successes before \u2014 Motherwell in 1945; Hamilton in 1967; and Glasgow Govan in 1973 and 1988 \u2014 only to lose each seat at the subsequent general election.\n\nThis time was different. Perth remains SNP territory to this day.\n\nThe party may be in trouble now but, with large majorities of younger voters telling pollsters that they support independence, the constitutional question which hangs over Scottish politics is not going away.\n\nIt is a question which Labour, a party forged in the din of Scotland's industrial revolution, has tussled with since its creation.\n\nThe Scottish Labour Party was founded in 1888 by two extraordinary but very different men, the miner and trade unionist Keir Hardie, and the aristocratic adventurer RB Cunninghame Graham.\n\nHardie went on to become the first leader of the UK Labour Party in 1906; Cunninghame Grahame the first president of the Scottish National Party in 1934.\n\nThe most fundamental change to Scottish governance in the democratic era was delivered by Labour when the Scottish Parliament took charge of domestic affairs such as health and education in 1999.\n\nBut it was the SNP which benefited most, gradually capturing almost all of the post-industrial seats which Labour had held for decades and, from 2007, taking charge of the Scottish government.\n\nLabour's Donald Dewar was the first first minister of Scotland when the Scottish Parliament opened in 1999\n\nNearly a quarter of a century later, Labour is led by Keir Hardie's namesake, Sir Keir Starmer, who spies an opportunity in the SNP's travails.\n\nOn Friday I accompanied Sir Keir, Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar and shadow climate change and net zero secretary, Ed Miliband on a trip to SSE's Beatrice wind farm off the east coast of Caithness.\n\nThe leader of the opposition at Westminster was in buoyant form, and no wonder.\n\nHis party sees the departure of multiple election winner Nicola Sturgeon \u2014 whom he calls a \"giant in Scottish politics\" \u2014 as great news.\n\n\"The SNP is imploding,\" he told me on the harbour side at Wick. \"I think everybody can see that.\"\n\nThe party, he added, \"has run out of road when it comes to the case for independence and that's shone a light on their record\".\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nWith a large and sustained polling lead across the UK, and signs of improvement in Scotland, Labour may be in a positive place but the path to Downing Street is not straight and clear, running through mixed terrain.\n\nFirst, there is the cosmopolitan and multicultural domain of London and other big English cities.\n\nThen there are the more socially conservative, Brexit-inclined \"red wall\" seats, in the Midlands and the north of England, which switched from Labour to Boris Johnson's Conservatives at the last general election.\n\nFinally there is the party's old Scots fiefdom, stretching from Ayrshire in the west through the central belt to Fife in the east, where the SNP have dominated with a pro-independence, pro-European message since 2015.\n\nThe SNP hold 45 of the Scottish 59 seats at Westminster (two more have defected to Alex Salmond's Alba Party since the last general election) but Labour strategists now reckon at least 15 of those would be competitive based on current polling, particularly in Glasgow, Fife, Midlothian and East Lothian.\n\nWith that in mind, on this trip Sir Keir appears to have adopted the doctor's maxim: first, do no harm. In our interview he uses the word \"humility\" a lot.\n\n\"I think Labour lost its way and got too far from voters here in Scotland and that's why I've spent a lot of time in Scotland listening, engaging, talking about the future,\" he says.\n\nPrecisely what he means by getting too far from the voters is not terribly clear.\n\nSir Keir Starmer, Ed Miliband and Anas Sarwar travelled to the Beatrice wind farm off Caithness on Friday\n\nHow would he respect the democratic will of the Scottish people to remain in the European Union, and the pro-independence majority in the Scottish Parliament?\n\nThe real answer to both questions is, he won't. But that would sound harsh so he adopts softer language.\n\nOn Brexit he says: \"If you want a closer relationship with the EU, I hear you, I agree with you and we will set about ensuring that we do have that close relationship.\"\n\nOn independence he rejects \"breaking up the United Kingdom,\" while recognising that there is a \"desire for change\".\n\nLabour's attempt to defuse independence as an issue is to acknowledge an asymmetry in political and economic power between the prosperous south east of England and other parts of the UK, which it proposes to tackle by embracing some of the recommendations in Gordon Brown's recent commission on the UK's future, while considering whether to adopt others.\n\nAlready on Labour's agenda are House of Lords reform; decentralisation of economic power to the nations and regions of the UK; and improved intergovernmental working between the various administrations of these islands.\n\n\"Decisions should be made by people most closely affected by those decisions,\" says Sir Keir.\n\nIsn't that an argument for independence?\n\nNo, he insists, it's an argument for local decision-making within the UK framework.\n\n\"The people in the Highlands can make decisions in partnership with the Labour government about the future living standards here, the future jobs, the skills we're talking about this morning,\" he explains.\n\nAware of this looming Labour threat, the SNP is keen to conflate Sir Keir's party with Rishi Sunak's, reminding voters that Labour and Tories joined together in the Better Together campaign against independence in 2014.\n\nLabour politicians joined Conservative and Liberal Democrat counterparts to campaign for the union ahead of the 2014 referendum\n\nSir Keir's decision to approvingly quote Margaret Thatcher in a speech on crime while in Stoke this week makes the SNP's job easier while underlining the Labour leader's difficulty in assembling such a diverse electoral coalition.\n\nStill, he can take comfort that his opponents here also face immense challenges.\n\nThe new SNP leader will have to tackle deep-rooted problems in Scotland's public services which are costing and blighting lives.\n\nHe or she will also be under pressure to set out a credible route map towards \u2014 and a credible plan for \u2014 independence.\n\nAnd the winner must also reunite a divided party in time for a general election expected to be held next year in which, it is now clearer than ever, Scotland will be a key battleground.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

You are truly the King of Flutes and I can't wait to play with you again.\"\n\nThe annual Met Gala is one of the biggest events in the New York celebrity calendar, raising money for the city's Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nTickets are rumoured to cost upwards of $50,000 (\u00a340,000) and the 400 or so guests are handpicked by organiser Anna Wintour, Vogue's editor-in-chief.\n\nBig, bold fashion statements are the order of the night and this year the guests were asked to wear outfits in honour of German designer Karl Lagerfeld, who died in 2019.\n\nLizzo, pictured on the red carpet at Monday's Met Gala, is best known for massive pop hits such as Good As Hell, About Damn Time and Juice\n\nLizzo dazzled in a long, black gown donned with strings of pearls and wore matching black leather gloves and Chanel earrings.\n\nThe Grammy-winning singer and classically-trained flute player was chosen as the performer for Monday's event and she and Sir James duetted on The Flight Of The Bumblebee.\n\nSir James and his wife live in Switzerland but were in New York to visit friends and family when they were invited to join Lizzo at the gala.\n\nSpeaking to BBC News NI, he praised Lizzo as a \"great entertainer\".\n\n\"When she gets on the stage she takes full command,\" he said.\n\n\"It was quite funny - they wanted to give us chairs and Lizzo complained so they came up with these two thrones.\n\n\"I was definitely impressed, she was very respectful.\"\n\nHis wife Lady Jeanne Galway said they had been sworn to secrecy ahead of the event but ultimately had a spectacular night.\n\nSir James Galway has sold tens of millions of records in a career spanning six decades\n\n\"When we first met Lizzo at the rehearsal on Saturday at 11pm at night she came and she bowed down to my husband and said what an honour it was,\" she said.\n\n\"She kept saying to me: 'I'm so nervous, I'm so nervous, he's my idol.'\"\n\nLady Galway said the performance was centred around the flute \"and that's why they wanted Sir James\".\n\n\"It started with 18 flautists planted around the hall and they're in incredible costumes.\n\n\"It was the most elegant group and they were so quiet when Sir James and Lizzo were playing.\"\n\nLady Galway, also a famous flautist who regularly duets on tour with her husband, spoke of her amazement at the Met Gala.\n\nLizzo often plays a flute during her live performances\n\n\"We had to sign more forms to secrecy that Sir James was playing,\" she said.\n\n\"And when we got invited Sir James said, typically: 'Ah, I don't think I want to get involved in this. This is going to be very complicated.'\n\n\"But the team is so professional and they brought us down by car to Vogue and they would give him anything he wanted to wear.\n\n\"They refitted my gold dress with pearls and they couldn't have been kinder.\n\n\"[The performance] was spectacular - it was a minute-and-a-half on stage but it was a strong minute-and-a-half.\n\n\"Then they went into the rest of the gala and the afterparty and we went home.\"", "A four-day walkout by junior doctors across England straight after the Easter break is putting patients at \"greater risk\", says Health Secretary Steve Barclay.\n\nMore than a quarter of a million appointments and operations could be cancelled in the strike that began this morning.\n\nThe British Medical Association is asking for a 35% pay rise.\n\nBut the government says that is an unreasonable request.\n\nMr Barclay accused organisers of timing the strike just after the Bank Holiday Easter weekend - a period when the NHS already faces increased demand and greater staff absence - \"to maximise disruption\".\n\nThe BMA said there were plans to pull doctors off picket lines if lives were in immediate danger. Under trade union laws, life-and-limb cover must be provided.\n\nThe junior doctors' approach contrasts with recent strikes by nurses and ambulance workers, which saw unions agree to exempt certain emergency services.\n\nBut doctors say they are striking for patient safety as much as about pay, saying that current pay levels are affecting recruitment and leading to many doctors leaving the profession.\n\nDr Emma Runswick, deputy chairwoman of the BMA, said they are hoping this round of industrial action will be the last - but \"we will continue\" if the government does not move.\n\nShe told BBC One's Breakfast. \"This is not a situation where we are fixed in our position. We are looking for negotiations and Steve Barclay isn't even willing to talk to us.\n\n\"He hasn't put any offer at all on the table. If we want to start a negotiation there has to be two sides in the discussion.\"\n\nMr Barclay said he had hoped to begin formal pay negotiations with the BMA last month but said its demand for a 35% pay rise was unfair and would result in some junior doctors \"receiving a pay rise of over \u00a320,000\".\n\nAre you a junior doctor with a view on the strike? Are you a patient affected? Share your experiences by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.\n\nProf Sir Stephen Powis, NHS England's national medical director, said it would be \"the most disruptive industrial action in NHS history\".\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme as the walkout began on Tuesday morning, Mr Powis warned it \"will take weeks\" to recover from the strikes as \"services will undoubtedly be affected\".\n\nDuring last month's three-day walkout by junior doctors, more than 175,000 treatments and appointments were cancelled.\n\nBut Prof Sir Stephen added the expectation is to see \"considerably more\" cancellations this time around due to the strike lasting four days. Estimates from other senior NHS figures have suggested between 250,000 and 350,000 appointments and operations could be cancelled.\n\nMental health services and some GP surgeries are also expected to be impacted, while the NHS said it will prioritise keeping critical care, maternity, neonatal care, and trauma operations running.\n\nDr Vivek Trivedi, co-chairman of the BMA junior doctors' committee, advised people to still ring 999 if they have a life-threatening illness as \"the service is working as normal and we have prioritised emergencies\".\n\nDr Paul Turnbull, 61, from Hampshire, who is an occupational health doctor, needs a prosthetic femur bone implanted in his leg.\n\nHis operation has been cancelled twice - once in December, because he developed deep vein thrombosis, and the second time because of the first junior doctors' strike. The operation is now due to take place on 18 April, after the four-day strike.\n\nHe has limited mobility and is unable to work.\n\n\"As a doctor, I don't believe doctors should strike. I think our first responsibility is to our patients and I think using patients as pawns in a dispute with the government is not something we should be doing.\"\n\nNeuroscientist Dr Camilla Hill, 42, from Nottingham, has also been affected. She has had two knee operations cancelled because of the junior doctors' strikes - one this week and one back in March. She now has a third date scheduled for 25 April.\n\nShe has been unable to do some of her favourite hobbies, which include hiking and sailing, in part because of the pain in her knees.\n\n\"I feel really frustrated. It's messed me about, it's messed about my employer, it's messed about my husband - and it's messed about his employer as well. It's not just the patient whose operation is cancelled that's impacted, it's everybody around them.\"\n\nJunior doctors say their demanding for a 35% increase in pay is to compensate for 15 years of below-inflation wage increases.\n\nBut the government has said the pay demand is unrealistic, pointing to the deal other health unions - representing nurses and other workers - have recommended to their members, which includes a 5% pay rise and one-off payment of at least \u00a31,655.\n\nMore than 40% of the medical workforce are classed as junior doctors, with two-thirds of them members of the BMA.\n\nThe term junior doctors covers those who are fresh out of medical school through to others who have a decade of experience behind them.\n\nRabiat is in her third year of junior training, working in a hospital in the south east of England.\n\nShe is planning on striking this week, saying it is as much about safety as it is pay.\n\n\"It's quite a common thing that junior doctors are left alone with wards of patients to look after, with their seniors having gone down to A&E or an acute assessment area, for example.\n\n\"We feel really left out and unsupported. Not because our seniors don't want to support us, but because we are all stretched to our limits.\n\n\"I really hope that the strikes will make the government realise that this is really having a big impact on junior doctors - and the whole of the NHS - and more actually needs to be done.\"\n\nAre you a junior doctor with a view on the strike?

The Russian authorities have not mentioned Krasnohorivka in their updates.\n\nEarlier this month, Mr Zelensky confirmed Ukraine's long-awaited counter-offensive to recapture areas occupied by Russia had begun.

It was there he played alongside the prolific pianist Hancock.\n\nShorter had also released solo albums as early as 1959, including the acclaimed Speak No Evil, Night Dreamer and JuJu.\n\nRecording solo albums gave him more creative freedom.

It wasn't malicious, it was miscommunication.\n\n\"I would never purposefully cheat and this was not a target race, but I don't want to make excuses.\n\n\"Mel didn't get the glory at the finish and I'm really sorry she didn't get that.\"\n\nDr Zakrzewski said she regretted not clarifying with the marshals at the end of the race that she was not running competitively.\n\nShe said she was \"devastated\" by what had happened and extremely upset to see \"haters\" on social media calling for her to have a lifetime ban.\n\n\"I've given so much to the running world so I am devastated this has happened,\" she said.\n\nIn February, at the Taipei Ultramarathon in Taiwan, Dr Zakrzewski won the 48-hour race outright - setting a world record across 255 miles (411.5 km).\n\nRacing for Great Britain in the IAU World 100km Championships, she won individual silver in 2011 and bronze in 2014 and 2015.\n\nShe also represented Team Scotland in the marathon at the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games.\n\nIn 2020, aged 44, she won a 24-hour event in Australia with a distance of 236.561km.\n\nShe has set a number of records including the Scottish 24-hour record, the British 200k and the Scottish 100 miles record.\n\u2022 None Ultrarunner disqualified for using a car in race", "The government says housing asylum seekers in places like the Bibby Stockholm will help cut its a \u00a36m-a-day hotel bill\n\nFor the first time, reporters have been allowed on board the Bibby Stockholm barge - the giant, floating accommodation complex that will house asylum seekers.\n\nThe barge is moored off Portland Port in Dorset and in the coming weeks will become home to 500 single men claiming UK asylum.\n\nWalking around on board, it has the feel of an old overnight ferry or an outdated motel - a bit of a faded 1980s/90s vibe.\n\nLong, confusing corridors lead to relatively spacious cabins which include a desk, wardrobe, safe locker, TV and large windows.\n\nEach room has an en-suite bathroom with a shower and there are additional facilities on each of the three floors.\n\nThere were originally 222 cabins - but the main contribution to increasing its capacity from 222 to 506 has been placing bunk beds in each room.\n\nThey're not the biggest beds, but the rooms don't feel too claustrophobic.\n\nThere's a TV room with a big screen and sofas, a multi-faith prayer room and a classroom which can be used for meetings and activities.\n\nSome other communal spaces have been converted to extra dormitory space for four to six men - but we weren't allowed to see these.\n\nThe dining room is large, with a long serving counter and tables of six set out in rows.\n\nThe sample menu includes eggs and pancakes for breakfast, potato soup and beef stew for dinner. We're told it will change regularly and cater for individual needs and religious requirements.\n\nThere's a gym and outdoor recreational space in the two courtyards in the centre of the barge. The men will also have access to the dockside, within a fenced off area - we're told this is to ensure the security of the port which also sees cruise ships, cargo vessels and navy craft docking.\n\nThere will also be 24/7 security in place on board.\n\nThe men will receive healthcare onboard the barge or remotely from a team of experts, the NHS said on Friday - following concerns among the local community over the impact extra people would have on local health services.\n\nBuses will be available hourly between 09:00 and 23:00 to take asylum seekers to Portland or Weymouth. It's not a curfew, but if they aren't back there will be a \"welfare call\" to check they're OK.\n\nThe government clearly wants to show that this accommodation isn't cruel or inhumane - but the Home Office has always described this as \"basic and functional\".\n\nIt certainly doesn't have ocean liner splendour - there's no grand staircase, fine artwork or sculpture. The stairwells feel quite industrial.\n\nIt is light, clean and currently seems reasonably comfortable.\n\nSome of the journalists on our visit felt the standard is better than some of the hotels currently housing asylum seekers. Of course, our stay only lasted one hour.\n\nSome men may be on board for nine months. And once it's full to capacity, conditions could feel very different.\n\nThe government says it is currently spending \u00a36m per day housing more than 50,000 migrants in hotels.\n\nThe Home Office says that by the autumn, they aim to house about 3,000 asylum seekers in places that aren't hotels - such as the barge, and former military sites Wethersfield in Essex and Scampton in Lincolnshire.\n\nLast week, the Home Office announced that the first asylum seekers had moved to Wethersfield. Fifty people are expected in the first group housed on the Bibby Stockholm.\n\nAs the vessel arrived on Tuesday morning, it was met with protests from local residents and human rights groups.\n\nImmigration minister Robert Jenrick said the government had been \"clear that those who arrive in the UK illegally should not be housed in expensive hotels\".\n\n\"Our use of alternative accommodation sites and vessels provide basic and appropriate standards for small boats arrivals while their claims are determined,\" he said.\n\nDorset Council is receiving \u00a33,500 per occupied bedspace on the Bibby Stockholm, with additional funding provided to the local NHS and police, the Home Office said.\n\nThe council has also received almost \u00a3380,000 in a one-off grant to help support local charity and voluntary organisations provide services on board, it is understood.", "Cefin Campbell says \"unacceptable behaviour\" was tolerated in Plaid Cymru for many years\n\nA culture of bullying and misogyny in Plaid Cymru was allowed to go on \"too long\", one of its MSs has said.\n\nCefin Campbell said rumours of misconduct were known about for \"many years\" within the party and everyone who failed to report it was complicit.\n\nAdam Price quit as leader on Wednesday after a report found \"too many instances of bad behaviour\" were tolerated by senior figures.\n\nMr Campbell said the culture within the party now \"had to change\".\n\n\"For too long... people have known about misconduct in Plaid Cymru, whether it's misogyny, bullying, sexual harassment or whatever unacceptable behaviour,\" the MS for Mid and West Wales told BBC Radio Wales.\n\nHe said he had not seen the behaviour described in a review led by former Plaid politician Nerys Evans since he became a Senedd member in 2021, but admitted he had \"heard rumours\".\n\n\"So we are all complicit in the sense that we haven't maybe reported even rumours, so that has to stop, that culture has to change.\"\n\nMr Campbell said he had supported Mr Price to continue as leader to implement the 82 recommendations in the report.\n\nAdam Price resigned after saying he no longer had the support of his party\n\nBut he said Mr Price had \"lost the dressing room\" among the Plaid's Senedd group and did the \"honourable thing\" by stepping down.\n\nNorth Wales MS Llyr Gruffydd became interim leader of Plaid on Thursday.\n\nMr Campbell said the party is not \"divided\" but the Senedd group has \"differing views\".\n\n\"I think that's always healthy for a democratic party,\" he said. \"I haven't seen any infighting, there have been different views.\"\n\nHe added he still respects those who moved against Mr Price, saying they did what they believed was \"for the good of the party\".\n\nPlaid Cymru has said a permanent new leader will be in place in the summer\n\nKarl Davies, who was Plaid Cymru chief executive from 1993 to 2002, warned that \"if the party has moved from being a place where people felt safe, felt inclusive, and it has become a fearful culture, with people not feeling that inclusion, then the party is in a dire situation\".\n\nSpeaking on BBC Radio Cymru's Dros Frecwast programme, he said: \"The party depends on its members in terms of financial resources, to go out and knock on doors during elections, and depends on being part of their community.\n\n\"If the members feel that they are not being led correctly and that the party leadership is maintaining the 'toxic' culture, as it was called in the report, then there will be no motivation to go out and do the work and that will be damning for the party practically as well as culturally.\"\n\nElin Jones believes it would be better if a \"divisive\" leadership election was avoided\n\nMr Davies spoke of a \"feeling that the membership in the Senedd has taken over the party and the members are less powerful\".\n\n\"The new leader needs to ensure that the members of the party feel that they are once again in control, and I really hope that there will be a leader who will understand the grass roots of the party,\" he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Senedd presiding officer and Ceredigion Plaid Cymru MS Elin Jones confirmed in a Facebook post that she would not be joining any leadership race.\n\nShe added that she would rather there was no such election at all, but admitted her view could belong to a \"minority of one\".\n\nMs Jones, who previously ran to lead the party in 2012, said: \"I won't be putting my name forward to be Plaid Cymru leader.\n\n\"Who would I like it to be? In all honesty, I'd like to see unity behind one candidate, thus avoiding a divisive, distracting leadership election so we can carry on with the job for our constituents and our country.\n\n\"There's a lot of work to do.\"", "Confusion at Twitter appears to be continuing after owner Elon Musk introduced limits to the amount of posts users can read in a day.\n\nThe billionaire announced the \"temporary measure\" to address extreme levels of data scraping on the site.\n\nInitial limits were quickly increased by Mr Musk at the weekend.\n\nWhile many users reported no longer seeing limits on Sunday, some said a \"rate limit exceeded\" notification had returned on Monday.\n\nMr Musk - who took over Twitter in October 2022 had said previously that he was not happy about artificial intelligence (AI) firms using Twitter's data to train their large language models.\n\nChanges to the platform at the weekend saw it impose an initial 600-tweet limit for unverified Twitter users who are not paying for a subscription to the platform, but Mr Musk said this had increased to 1,000 on Saturday evening.\n\nHe has not yet provided an update on whether the limits will remain in place.\n\nResponding to a user flagging issues with site features, Mr Musk said in a tweet on Saturday morning Twitter had imposed the measures as a result of \"EXTREME levels of data scraping\".\n\nThe process is a key method of gathering content and information from web platforms, and involves extracting data from sites, often at great scale, to make it accessible and readable in local formats, such as in a spreadsheet.\n\n\"Almost every company doing AI, from start-ups to some of the biggest corporations on Earth, was scraping vast amounts of data,\" Mr Musk added in his tweet.\n\n\"It is rather galling to have to bring large numbers of servers online on an emergency basis just to facilitate some AI startup's outrageous valuation.\"\n\nSimilar concerns over the mass use of platform data to train AI models in part sparked Reddit's decision to make companies pay to access its data.\n\nData scientist and ex-Twitter employee, Dr Rumman Chowdhury, told the BBC it was unclear if AI organisations had been scraping data from Twitter, but suggested financial issues could be behind the changes.\n\n\"Frankly, I think I'm in a majority of people who believe that it's due to his lack of payment of his bills... and he's attempting to reduce his costs,\" she said.\n\nAn Australian project management firm has filed a lawsuit against Twitter in a US court seeking cumulative payments of about A$1m (\u00a3534,000) over alleged non-payment of bills for work done in four countries, court filings show.\n\nIn May, a former public relations firm filed a suit in a New York court saying Twitter had not paid its bills, while early this year US-based advisory firm Innisfree M&A Inc sued it, seeking about $1.9m (\u00a31.4m) for what it said were unpaid bills after it advised Twitter on its acquisition by Mr Musk.\n\nSince Mr Musk bought Twitter he has focused on reducing costs by laying off half the workforce and introducing the subscription service, which offers the sought-after \"verified\" badge for a monthly fee.\n\nFor a platform that requires engagement, limiting posts seems to go in the opposite direction. It is a \"very extreme and unprecedented tactic\" which is \"already failing\", said Dr Chowdhury.\n\nTwitter saw advertisers flee amid worries about Mr Musk's approach to content moderation rules, affecting its revenue.\n\nWhen Mr Musk spoke to the BBC in April, he said the company was now \"roughly breaking even\", claiming most of its advertisers were returning.\n\nThe limit on tweets saw some journalists, who use Twitter to find information for live reporting and verification of stories, confronted with the curbs.\n\nBel Trew, chief international correspondent for The Independent, tweeted that limits to how many tweets she could read on the platform had left her at a \"complete loss\" while reporting on Sunday.\n\nAnd a reporter in the US city of Baltimore was left unable to view tweets from the local police department's Twitter account in the wake of a shooting that left two people killed and a further 28 injured.\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

For Ukrainians, during this war we just can't do handshakes, and you have to change, and you have to have some respect for us.\n\n\"When I have a choice... where I shake hands I will never shake hands with her. I'm sorry but there is something bigger than Olympic Games or license or fencing and finally I understood that, there is something more. The support for the Ukrainian people, it's incredible.\"\n\nBefore the IOC's decision, the president of Russia's Olympic Committee said the body had \"picked a side\" in the Russia-Ukraine dispute.\n\nThat was because the IOC had responded to Kharlan's initial suspension by encouraging sports federations to handle Ukrainian athletes with sensitivity.\n\nBut Stanislav Pozdnyakov said the IOC advice \"clearly showed duplicity\".\n\n\"The statement in question indicates that the IOC determined for itself and picked a side in the political conflict, [and] began to act in the interests of this side,\" he said on Telegram.\n\nAfter Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the IOC imposed sporting sanctions on Russia and its ally Belarus but earlier this year recommended that Russian and Belarusian athletes could compete as individuals under a neutral flag and with no anthem.\n\nKharlan became the first fencer to face a Russian or Belarusian since the invasion.\n\nAfter the snub, Smirnova staged a 45-minute sit-down protest, resulting in Kharlan, a four-time individual world champion and four-time Olympic medallist, being shown a black card.\n\nThat ruled her out of the women's sabre individual event and it appeared she would miss the team competition as well before the federation lifted her suspension.\n\u2022 None Watch: Svitolina gets emotional speaking about

aggression against their country,\" the IOC said in a statement it reiterated after Pozdnyakov's comments.\n\n\"Therefore, we encourage international federations to handle situations involving Ukrainian and individual neutral athletes with the necessary degree of sensitivity.\n\n\"We continue to stand in full solidarity with the Ukrainian athletes and the Olympic community of Ukraine.\"\n\nKharlan, 32, followed the example of Ukrainian tennis players such as Elina Svitolina by not shaking hands with Russian or Belarusian opponents, but International Fencing Federation (FIE) rules state that fencers must shake hands.\n\nShe claimed that FIE president Emmanuel Katsiadakis had assured her that it was \"possible\" not to shake hands and offer a touch of her blade instead.\n\n\"I thought I had his word, to be safe, but apparently, no,\" Kharlan added.", "About 170 people were relocated from the western French town of La Laigne after an earthquake on Friday

operations\n\nThe Ministry of Defence has confirmed for the first time that UK Special Forces are at the centre of a war crimes inquiry.\n\nThe MoD on Wednesday abandoned an effort to restrict any mention of Special Forces' involvement in alleged war crimes in Afghanistan.\n\nThe MoD's stance had been challenged by bereaved family members and by several media outlets, including the BBC.\n\nThe inquiry follows years of reporting into alleged SAS unlawful killings.\n\nIn a statement ahead of a hearing of the Independent Inquiry relating to Afghanistan, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: \"The inquiry is now reaching the stage of substantive hearings, and I can confirm that the allegations relate to the conduct of UK Special Forces.\"\n\nThe decision to confirm the involvement of Special Forces units in operations under scrutiny from the inquiry reverses the position previously held by the MoD.\n\nMr Wallace said the confirmation of Special Forces involvement was made only \"in the exceptional circumstances of this inquiry\".\n\n\"Outside of this very specific context, such confirmation should not be seen to alter the longstanding position of this government, and previous governments, to not comment on the deployment or activities of the UK Special Forces,\" he said.\n\nThe MoD had previously argued that the inquiry should restrict from the public \"any evidence or documents or words or passages of documents, that tend to confirm or deny the alleged involvement of United Kingdom Special Forces in the operations that are to be investigated\".\n\nBut on Monday, less than 48 hours before they were due to argue their case in front of the chair of the inquiry, Lord Justice Haddon-Cave, MoD lawyers wrote to the inquiry saying the ministry \"proposed to abandon that part of their application\".\n\nThe reversal, confirmed at the hearing on Wednesday, means that evidence of involvement of UK Special Forces in the alleged unlawful killings in Afghanistan can be discussed openly in the inquiry hearings and reported publicly.\n\nA long-running investigation by the BBC uncovered evidence clearly indicating that one SAS unit operating in Afghanistan in 2010 and 2011 killed 54 people in suspicious circumstances in one six-month tour.\n\nFurther reporting by the BBC uncovered specific cases that caused concern at the highest level of UK Special Forces, including a 2012 raid in which a different unit killed two parents and gravely wounded their two infant boys.\n\nThe MoD is still pursuing a request for all Special Forces personnel involved in the operations in Afghanistan to automatically be granted anonymity, and for all witness evidence about the operations themselves to be held in closed hearings, away from both the bereaved families and the public.\n\nThe MoD's lawyer, Brian Altman KC, also said that the ministry intended to keep in place its \"neither confirm nor deny\" policy in relation to naming specific UK Special Forces units or sub-units, arguing that the identification of \"particular force elements\" would pose a risk to future capabilities and operations.\n\nLawyers for the families of Afghans killed in seven separate Special Forces operations argue that the overall restrictions being sought by the MoD are \"unjustifiable and seriously damaging to the credibility of the inquiry\".\n\nTessa Gregory, a partner at Leigh Day, the law firm representing the families, said that the relatives had suffered \"years of cover up and obfuscation\" and remained concerned even as the inquiry began that the MoD was \"seeking to shut the door on them and prevent evidence being heard in public\".\n\n\"The bereaved families now put their trust in the inquiry to uncover the truth,\" Ms Gregory said.\n\nSpeaking at the opening of the hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, Lord Justice Haddon Cave said that, in line with the 2005 Inquiries Act, \"as much as possible should be heard in public to allay public concerns about the subject matter of the inquiry\".\n\nBut the chair acknowledged that some evidence would need to be heard in closed hearings, because of national security concerns. \"The essential task is to balance the competing considerations in the public interest,\" he said.\n\nA spokesman for the MoD said: \"It is not appropriate for the MoD to comment on cases which are within the scope of the Statutory Inquiry and it is up to the Statutory Inquiry Team, led by Lord Justice Haddon-Cave, to determine which allegations are investigated.\"\n\nA lawyer for the Royal Military Police, Paul Greaney KC, told the inquiry on Wednesday that it was currently investigating allegations of unlawful killings in Afghanistan and had received evidence from informants on a confidential basis.\n\nStressing the importance of continuing its investigations without prejudicing potential prosecutions, and avoiding discouraging new informants coming forward, the RMP said it was seeking its own restrictions around three key areas: matters relating to its ongoing investigations; the identities of confidential informants; and the covert techniques and methods employed by

is this all in my head?\"\n\nAnother victim described how her stalker took away her feelings of freedom.\n\n\"[I was] living with looking over my shoulder, at times fearing for my life,\" she said.\n\n\"On one occasion I had 155 WhatsApp messages in a few hours and was also receiving messages on two other platforms at the same time.\"\n\nOn another occasion the stalker started playing music through the victim's speaker in her home, despite him being 15 miles away.\n\nDet Supt Lindsay Fisher said police were asking the public not to ignore the \"red flags\", adding that stalking is not just someone \"lurking in the shadows\".\n\n\"If someone's behaviour towards you is fixated, obsessive, unwanted and repeated, this is stalking,\" she said.\n\n\"Stalking can actually take many forms and can be online as well as in person and could be someone known to you or a complete stranger.\"\n\nDet Supt Fisher said stalking often results in fear, trauma and, in some tragic cases, murder\n\nDet Supt Fisher described it as \"an insidious crime that takes over and destroys lives.\"\n\nShe said statistics showed people suffered up to 100 incidents before reporting stalking -

After hosing it down, we saw that it had markings that appeared unnatural and possibly man-made.\"\n\nThe timber has been carbon dated to between 4640 BC and 4605 BC, making it around 2,000 years older than Stonehenge, and 500 years older than the only other known piece of carved Mesolithic timber, which was found near Maerdy in Rhondda Cynon Taf in 2012.\n\nThe large timber was carved 2,000 years before Stonehenge was built\n\nHistoric England chief executive Duncan Wilson said: \"This exciting find has helped to shine new light on our distant past and we're grateful to the landowner for recognising its significance.\n\n\"Amazing discoveries like these remind us of the power of archaeology to uncover the hidden narratives that connect us to our roots.\"\n\nThe waterlogged carved oak is one metre long, 0.42 metres wide and 0.2 metres thick.\n\nThe wood is being conserved at Historic England's Fort Cumberland facility\n\nIt was found about 1.5 metres (5ft) below the surface not far from the present course of the River Lambourn in a layer of peat.\n\nMr Fawcett has donated the timber to the West Berkshire Museum in Newbury where it will eventually go on display.\n\nThe museum is also working with the Boxford History Project to arrange for the timber to go on loan to the Boxford village heritage centre.\n\n:: Fort Cumberland's Gill Campbell talks to BBC Radio Berkshire's Andrew Peach about Britain's oldest wood carving.

It also warned that cost-cutting and inaccurate modelling of future demand could mean new hospitals are too small.\n\nThe health department remained \"firmly committed\" to delivering the England building pledge, a spokesperson said.\n\nThe hospitals plan was a Conservative manifesto commitment during the December 2019 election campaign, and it was made policy the following year.\n\nWhen the health department officially set out the plan in October 2020, eight hospital construction projects already under way were not included in the target. But recent government statements about building 40 new hospitals include these eight projects, referred to as \"legacy hospitals\".\n\nAnd in May, the government changed the scope of the scheme to include hospitals in urgent need of repairs, including five judged to be at risk of collapse because of crumbling concrete infrastructure.\n\nNow the National Audit Office has analysed the plans and found that, by the definition set out in 2020, the target will be missed, and only 32 will be built in time. The NAO said the government has used a \"broad\" definition of \"new\", which includes refurbishment of existing buildings as well as completely new hospitals.\n\nThe 32 that will be built in time include 24 from the original new hospitals programme, five that were added in May, and three new mental health hospitals.\n\nIt said a further eight do not count towards the original definition of \"new\" because they were already under way when the commitment was made.\n\nQuestions have been asked for some time about whether the programme is on track and it is significant that the watchdog has now ruled that, judged by the original template, it is not.\n\nIn May, a BBC News investigation found that building work had not started on 33 of the projects.\n\nThe NAO said staff shortages mean a planned design for a standardised hospital has been delayed until May 2024.\n\nIt also warned that a push to meet the target at the lowest possible cost - combined with optimistic forecasts about how much care will be outside hospitals in the future - could result in new hospitals that are too small.\n\nThe government had failed to achieve good value for money, the NAO said, as it called for a review of the underlying assumptions behind the plans to make sure the new hospitals are fit for purpose.\n\nHealth Secretary Steve Barclay had already told MPs in May that some of the original group included in the new hospitals programme might not be completed by 2030.\n\nHe made the admission as he updated the department's building plans to deal with hospitals built with a lightweight concrete that was used in the 1980s and is now judged to be unsafe.\n\nBut he restated the commitment to deliver 40 new hospitals by the end of the decade.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. The PM says delivering 40 new hospitals is \"one of the many things\" the government is doing for the health service.\n\nThe Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has also said the target will be met.\n\nHe described the plans to build the hospitals as one of the \"many things we're doing\" to improve healthcare, citing \"community diagnostics in local communities\" and the workforce plan as \"all ways we're backing the NHS\" and \"cutting waiting lists\".\n\nGareth Davies, head of the NAO, said the programme included \"innovative plans\" to improve efficiency and quality. But there are important lessons to ensure future major projects were affordable, transparent and delivered on time, he said.\n\nSir Julian Hartley, chief executive of NHS Providers, urged the government to \"shift gears\" to get the hospitals built and warned that costs had \"spiralled due to high inflation\".\n\nHe said many NHS trusts were \"deeply disappointed\" by delays and said the government \"could have better managed expectations about the funding available, given the uncertainty involved and the impact of inflation\".\n\nNHS leaders have warned some buildings desperately need to be upgraded\n\nLiberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said the \"utterly damning report demolishes the government's claims to be building 40 'new hospitals'\".\n\nShe called on the health secretary to make an urgent statement in Parliament addressing its findings, saying \"the public deserves answers\".\n\nLabour's shadow health secretary Wes Streeting said: \"The Conservatives have overpromised, under-delivered, and they've been found out.\n\n\"Meanwhile patients are being treated in outdated, crumbling hospitals.\"\n\nA health department spokesperson said: \"The NAO's report acknowledges that despite changes to the original programme, 40 new hospitals are still expected to be delivered by 2030 and praises the programme's innovative plans to standardise hospital construction, deliver efficiencies and improve quality.\n\n\"We remain firmly committed to delivering these hospitals, which are now expected to be backed by over \u00a320 billion of investment, helping to cut waiting lists so people can get the treatment they need quicker.\n\n\"Three new hospitals have already opened and more will open this year so patients and staff can benefit from major new hospital buildings, equipped with the latest technology.\"", "Moscow says it downed two drones that were targeting the Kremlin last night, accusing Ukraine of attempting to kill President Vladimir Putin.\n\nOne video circulating on Russian social media appears to show an object flying and exploding above the dome of the Senate Palace.

Explained: Why has Scotland\u2019s new hate crime law proved controversial?\n\nScotland's new hate crime law has come into force, with JK Rowling and Elon Musk among its critics.\n\nThe Harry Potter author and the owner of social media platform X both claim the legislation could harm free speech.\n\nSenior police officers say they expect a flood of complaints about online posts.\n\nBut the Scottish government insists the law provides protection from hate and prejudice without stifling individual expression.\n\n\"I think there has been a lot of misinformation,\" about the legislation, said the Victims and Community Safety Minister Siobhian Brown, before going on to claim, inaccurately, that it was \"passed unanimously\" by MSPs in 2021.\n\nIn fact the law was approved by 82 votes to 32 with four abstentions after heated debate about its contents.\n\nThe Hate Crime and Public Order (Scotland) Act 2021 creates a new crime of \"stirring up hatred\" relating to age, disability, religion, sexual orientation, transgender identity or being intersex.\n\nThe maximum penalty is a prison sentence of seven years.\n\nA person commits an offence if they communicate material, or behave in a manner, \"that a reasonable person would consider to be threatening or abusive,\" with the intention of stirring up hatred based on the protected characteristics.\n\nStirring up hatred based on race, colour, nationality or ethnicity was already illegal in Great Britain under the Public Order Act 1986 but, in an attempt to streamline the criminal law in Scotland, that too is now part of the Hate Crime Act.\n\nThe bar for this offence is lower than for the other protected characteristics, as it also includes \"insulting\" behaviour, and as the prosecution need only prove that stirring up hatred was \"likely\" rather than \"intended\".\n\nIn England and Wales stirring up hatred over race, religion or sexual orientation by threatening behaviour remains illegal.\n\nThe hate crime law in Scotland includes more protected characteristics.\n\nSupporters of the new law point out that it contains safeguards designed to protect freedom of speech.\n\nFor example, it states that it is a defence for a person charged with stirring up hatred to show that their actions were \"reasonable.\"\n\nIt also references the right to freedom of expression in Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which includes protection for \"ideas that offend, shock or disturb.\"\n\nTo be convicted of a hate crime, \"you have to be really threatening and really abusive, and there has to be reasonable assumption from others that that is the case,\" said Ms Brown.\n\nAs well as the offence of stirring up hatred, the Hate Crime Act also consolidates the existing law on crimes which are \"aggravated by prejudice.\"\n\nThese are where an offender demonstrates malice or ill-will towards their victim based on a protected characteristic, which can be taken into account by a sheriff or judge with a longer sentence or a higher fine than would otherwise have been the case.\n\nFor example, if an assailant punched someone in the face while also making a hateful comment about their age, that might be assault aggravated by age-related hatred.\n\nThis is the first time that age has been included in the list of protected characteristics for aggravated offences, a move welcomed by some campaign groups.\n\n\"It's going to be a positive thing for the country,\" said Adam Stachura of the charity Age Scotland.\n\nOthers are less enthusiastic.\n\nFormer Conservative MSP Adam Tomkins voted against the bill\n\nAdam Tomkins, professor of public law at Glasgow University, and a former Conservative MSP, voted against the bill because it could see someone convicted of stirring up hatred for a comment they make in private in their own home, not just in public, \"and I just don't think that's where the criminal law belongs.\"\n\nHowever, Professor Tomkins said he believed the law only posed a risk to free speech \"if it's misunderstood,\" adding, \"if it's properly understood, I think this is a fairly safe piece of legislation now.\"\n\nSusan Smith of For Women Scotland, which campaigned against recent proposed changes to gender law, is not convinced.\n\nSusan Smith fears those who are investigated under the new law will have their lives 'upended'\n\n\"The tests are quite woolly and we don't know how people are going to interpret this,\" she told BBC News.\n\n\"We do anticipate that there will be a lot of malicious complaints, a lot of rather trivial complaints and potentially people who are investigated will see their lives upended.\n\n\"I imagine there will be many complaints, for example, made against JK Rowling,\" she added.\n\nMs Rowling, a prominent critic of some transgender activism, described the law as \"ludicrous\" in a defiant post on X (formerly Twitter) last month.\n\nMr Musk has cited discussion about the legislation as an \"example of why it is so important to preserve freedom of speech.\"\n\nVic Valentine of the charity Scottish Trans said the organisation supported the law because of the \"serious impact that hate crime can have on LGBTI people.\"\n\nVic Valentine from Scottish Trans says the delay is frustrating\n\nIt would not, Vic added, criminalise behaviour which transgender people might simply find upsetting, offensive or even transphobic.\n\nThe SNP-led Scottish government has tried to soothe concerns.\n\nSiobhian Brown described the act as \"ambitious\" while also insisting it would \"not necessarily\" criminalise anything that was not already criminal.\n\nAsked whether \"misgendering\" someone or making a comment about their religion would be a crime the minister replied: \"This will be up to Police Scotland. I wouldn't say misgendering if you say something on social media for example it would be up to Police Scotland to determine.\"\n\nCh Supt Rob Hay of the Association of Scottish Police Superintendents (ASPS), which represents senior officers, said there was the potential for a \"huge uplift\" in complaints about social media posts.\n\nCh Supt Rob Hay said the resourcing of police is a key concern\n\nMr Hay said his central concern was that Police Scotland \"haven't been provided with any additional resources in terms of dealing with this piece of legislation.\"\n\nJust last month the national force said it was no longer able to investigate every \"low level\" crime, including some cases of theft and criminal damage.\n\nIt has, however, pledged to investigate every hate crime complaint it receives.\n\nBBC News understands that these will be assessed by a \"dedicated team\" within Police Scotland including \"a number of hate crime advisers\" to assist officers in determining what, if any, action to take.\n\nAt a recent meeting of the Scottish Police Authority board, Chief Constable Jo Farrell said her force would apply the act \"in a measured way\" under \"close scrutiny.\"\n\nDebate about the act has also resurrected a long-running row about how police forces throughout Britain record allegations of hate crimes where no charges are brought.\n\nThe Conservative MSP Murdo Fraser has been leading a campaign against the recording of what are termed \"non-crime hate incidents\" after he discovered that Police Scotland had recorded a comment he had made on social media as a hate incident, despite deciding that no crime had been committed.\n\nMore generally, the publicity about the new law, and the controversy surrounding it, has prompted warnings that it could lead to self-censorship.\n\nRoddy Dunlop KC, dean of the Faculty of Advocates, said it could have a \"chilling effect\" on free speech.\n\nAnd some feminist groups have raised concerns that the absence of sex as a protected characteristic in the legislation leaves women unprotected.\n\nThe Scottish government has promised to introduce a separate misogyny law \"in due course\" following a report by the barrister, Helena Kennedy KC.", "Toys and flowers were left at the scene of the incident in 2021\n\nA woman has been found guilty of murdering her eight-week old son and attempting to murder his two-year-old sister.\n\nThe woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, accepted she stabbed the children on 27 July 2021 but denied the charges.\n\nBut jurors rejected her argument and found her guilty after more than five hours of deliberations.\n\nThe woman was convicted at Belfast Crown Court on Thursday.\n\nShe will receive an automatic life sentence, with the amount of time she has to serve before being considered for parole to be set at a later date.\n\nThe woman placed her head in her hands and sobbed \"no, no, no\" as the guilty verdict was read out.\n\nThe juror who read the verdict also broke down as she read it and had to sit down to compose herself.\n\nWhen handing down the life sentence, Judge Donna McColgan said \"this has been a very difficult and stressful case\".\n\n\"I will be excusing the jury from jury service for the rest of their lives,\" she added.\n\n\"Counselling will also be made available to all jurors.\"\n\nOver the last six weeks, Belfast Crown Court has heard harrowing evidence.\n\nAfter the woman stabbed the children, she made five phone calls, including one to the children's father, telling him that their daughter was \"lying slowly bleeding\".\n\nIt was only after this call that she phoned 999, telling police: \"I killed my kid for him.\"\n\nThe trial was held at Belfast Crown Court\n\nDuring the trial, prosecuting counsel read a statement from the children's father to the court, as he was deemed too unwell to attend court as a witness.\n\nHe said on the evening of the stabbings, he was in England and had missed a call from his then partner as he was sleeping.\n\nHe returned her call and she told him she had killed the baby, that the baby's sister was slowly bleeding and that she was going to kill herself.\n\nHe then phoned the police.\n\nDuring the trial, the jury was shown harrowing footage from the body cameras of police officers who responded to a 999 call made by the defendant.\n\nThe videos showed the woman sitting on her living room floor in handcuffs and bleeding from a self-inflicted wound to her neck.\n\nThe footage also captured a police officer attempting to drive the injured girl to hospital in a PSNI car before handing her over to paramedics.\n\nBoth youngsters were taken to the emergency department at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children and were treated as they lay side-by-side.\n\nWhilst the young girl was successfully treated for a stab wound to her chest, her baby brother was later pronounced dead.\n\nFollowing her arrest, the defendant made the case that she stabbed her children and then turned the knife on herself as she wanted them all to die together.\n\nThe court heard that during subsequent police interviews, she made references to her partner's use of drink and drugs, and also claimed that he beat and sexually abused her.\n\nWhen asked by a detective what she was thinking at the time, she said: \"I wanted to kill all three, all of us so that [their father], could have a happy life together with his new woman.\n\n\"This was the only solution that came to my mind.\"\n\nThe woman also spent four days in the witness box at Belfast Crown Court where she was questioned about the events of 27 July 2021 - and where she denied stabbing her children out of spite and malice towards their father.\n\nSobbing as she gave evidence, the defendant claimed she tried to resuscitate her baby son after stabbing him in the chest and also told the jury that after attacking her daughter, she then tried to keep her alive by holding her to her chest.\n\nShe said she did not know what \"was going on in my mind at that time\" and told the court she could not forgive herself and wished she could \"turn back time\".\n\nThe defendant sobbed as she was taken from the dock and back into custody.", "Greggs plans to open around 150 new bakeries in 2023 as part of major plans to expand.\n\nThe firm, which opened its first shop in Newcastle in 1951, also plans to extend the opening hours of some outlets and test 24-hour drive-thrus.\n\nIt comes after the chain posted bumper profits for 2022, despite cost of living pressures hitting consumers.\n\nThe bakery chain has put up its prices several times in the last few years blaming rising costs.\n\nUnder the new plans Greggs, which currently has around 2,300 shops, aims to open more branches in airports, train stations, supermarkets and shopping centres.\n\nIt also said it hoped to grow its total number of bakeries to over 3,000 in the coming years.\n\nThe chain - which made profits of \u00a3148.3m last year - put its growth down to the \"value\" it was offering customers impacted by the rising cost of living.\n\nInflation - the rate at which prices rise - is near a 40-year-high, forcing many consumers to cut back their spending or find way ways to cut costs.\n\nHowever, the cost of ingredients for Gregg's pasties and pies has been going up, along with its energy bills and staff wages.\n\nAs a result, the chain's prices rose in 2022 and 2023. In January it increased the price of a sausage roll from \u00a31.15 to \u00a31.20 - the fourth price rise since 2021 when the snack cost \u00a31.\n\nAs well as opening 150 new shops, Greggs said it would refurbish another 150 and relocate 40 of its shops to larger sites.\n\nLast year, the opening hours of 500 shops were extended until 20:00 or later and in 2023, Greggs said it planned to extend hours in 300 shops to 21:00.\n\nGreggs was first founded by John Gregg in the late 1930s when he began delivering yeast, eggs and confectionery on his bicycle to homes around mining terraces in Newcastle.\n\nThe company then opened its first shop on Gosforth High Street in 1951 and the firm has gone onto to become a well-known brand.\n\nRuss Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said the firm's value proposition put it in a good place in the current climate.\n\n\"With the best will in the world and even when household budgets are under real pressure sometimes people are just too busy to make sandwiches.

They've had massive increases in the cost of that debt,\" he said.\n\nHowever, he said the committee, which would also be questioning water companies on Wednesday, wanted to know where the debt came from.\n\nSir Robert believed the firm was taking money out in the form of debt payments, instead of dividends. \"Our suspicion is that a lot of this debt is with these very funds that own the shares,\" he said.\n\nThe committee chairman said the MPs would want to know: \"Have Ofwat been asleep at the wheel or have they just not had the powers to inquire into some of the finance structures?\"\n\nOfwat's appearance on Wednesday will be the second appearance in as many weeks in front of politicians. Last week its chief executive David Black gave evidence to the Lords' business committee when he denied the watchdog had failed to regulate the industry well.\n\nBut he admitted there were \"hard lessons to learn\" and that he had been \"angered\" by excessive chief executive pay in the industry.\n\nThames Water is not the only water company in the spotlight. The management of Southern Water is also up for scrutiny.\n\n\"It does seem rather reckless,\" Sir Robert said. \"Southern Water's credit rating has been downgraded yet again. The owners of these companies are having put to put money in yet again. My worry is the money that we're paying as water users will be going to service that debt, rather than what we want to see, which is paying to clean up our rivers and improve sewage treatment.\"\n\nHowever, the chair of the select committee argued a return to nationalisation was not the answer: \"I can remember when water investment was way back in the queue behind hospitals and education and to be fair, we have seen massive investment in improving our infrastructure.\n\n\"The general problem with pollution is when it rains. Many older houses have the water from their roofs going straight into the sewer, which massively overloads the system, and that's something that can be addressed with storm-water tanks. It can also be addressed by people putting in water bowsers or catching the grey water and using that to flush their toilets.\"\n\nThames Water, which is due to publish its annual results on Monday, said it would be making no comment.\n\nIn a statement to the BBC on Sunday Ofwat said: \"Thames Water need to develop a robust and credible plan to turn around the business and transform its performance for customers and the environment.

Mr Low is currently at large, and believed to be in China.\n\nProsecutors say the financier used his vast resources to curry favour with celebrities, including Mr DiCaprio and model Miranda Kerr.\n\nMr Low's parties also drew the likes of Alicia Keys, Paris Hilton and Britney Spears. Spears once jumped out of a cake to wish Mr Low a happy birthday.\n\nIn the Washington DC court on Monday, a soft-spoken, bearded Mr DiCaprio testified about his financial ties with Mr Low.\n\nMr DiCaprio - who described himself simply as \"an actor\" - told jurors he first met Mr Low at a party in Las Vegas in 2010.\n\nIn subsequent years, he attended \"a multitude of lavish parties\" on yachts and nightclubs at Mr Low's invitation, alongside other celebrities, actors and musicians.\n\nOn one occasion, Mr DiCaprio attended a New Year's Eve party in Australia with Mr Low, after which partygoers were flown to the US in an effort to celebrate New Year's twice.\n\nThe actor's 2013 film Wolf of Wall Street - about a notorious fraudster - was partially funded by a firm tied to Mr Low.\n\n\"I understood him to be a huge businessman with many connections,\" Mr DiCaprio said in court. \"He was a prodigy in the business world and ultra-successful.\"\n\nUS District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly more than once asked the actor to \"keep his voice up\" so he could be heard by the jury and court reporter.\n\nMr Michel looked at the actor and waved when Mr DiCaprio was asked to identify him in court.\n\nBloomberg previously reported that Mr Low was \"especially generous\" with Mr DiCaprio and donated a $3.2m work of art by Picasso to his charity, in addition to a $9.2m piece from Jean-Michel Basquiat.\n\nMr DiCaprio reportedly later turned those items and others received from Mr Low over to authorities.\n\nOn Monday, the actor said that Mr Low also actively participated in auctions held by Mr DiCaprio in St Tropez \"to bring in funds\" for his environmentally focused foundation.\n\nLater in their relationship, Mr DiCaprio said the two men began discussing US politics, with Mr Low expressing an interest in making a \"significant contribution\" of between $20m and $30m to the Democratic party ahead of the 2012 presidential election.\n\n\"I basically said, 'wow, that's a lot of money',\" Mr DiCaprio said. Authorities believe those funds were embezzled from 1MDB.\n\nMr DiCaprio did not accuse Mr Michel of wrongdoing in his testimony.\n\nHe said that he first met Mr Michel in the 1990s following a Fugees concert.\n\nHe added that Mr Michel might have also attended a Thanksgiving party at his home, although \"memory does not serve\" and he could not say for sure.\n\nIn 2019 Mr DiCaprio reportedly testified before a grand jury in Washington DC as part of the justice department's investigation into the 1MDB scheme.\n\nMr DiCaprio told jurors that he lost contact with Mr Low around 2015 after being informed that he was under investigation for his financial dealings.\n\nThe Oscar-winner may not be the only celebrity to testify in Pras Michel's trial.\n\nDuring jury selection, attorneys named actors including Jim Carrey, Jamie Foxx and Mark Wahlberg as possible witnesses, in addition to director Martin Scorsese, according to CNN.\n\nThe sprawling case could also see testimony from former high-level US government officials and political insiders, including Donald Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon and Rudy Giuliani, former mayor of New York and previously a lawyer for Mr Trump.", "Patients can expect severe disruption to services as senior hospital doctors in England prepare to strike for 48 hours, from 07:00 Thursday, over pay, NHS England warns.\n\nThousands of planned appointments are being postponed.\n\nConsultants will stop seeing many patients and will not be around to supervise the work of junior doctors.\n\nThey will provide so-called Christmas Day cover, meaning emergency care and a small amount of routine work.\n\nThe walkout is over the government's \"final offer\" of a 6% rise - in line with pay-review body recommendations but far below what doctors, who say their pay has been eroded by inflation, want.\n\nThe longest junior-doctors' walkout so far - across five days - ended on Tuesday. Their strike had caused tens of thousands of postponed appointments, England's top doctor, Prof Sir Stephen Powis, said. And the consultants' walkout was expected to have an even bigger impact.\n\nThe back-to-back action had left NHS services with almost no time to recover, Sir Stephen said.\n\n\"This could undoubtedly be the most severe impact we have ever seen in the NHS as a result of industrial action, with routine care virtually at a standstill for 48 hours,\" he said.\n\n\"We are working closely with the British Medical Association [BMA] and the British Dental Association to ensure that emergency and urgent care is prioritised and patients remain safe - but in the eighth month of industrial action and with more than 600,000 appointments already affected, it's becoming even more challenging to get services back on track after each round of action.\"\n\nOn the strike days, people should use 999 in life-threatening emergencies and NHS 111 online for other health concerns. GP services and pharmacies can also be accessed in the normal way.\n\nThose not told their appointments have been postponed should attend as normal.\n\nRadiographers, who scan patients, plan to strike for 48 hours in some parts of England from 08:00 on 25 July.\n\nUnlike junior doctors at the start of their dispute, consultants are not asking for full pay restoration in one go. Instead, they want the government to start giving pay rises that at least match inflation, currently just above 11%.\n\nNHS consultants earn more than \u00a3126,000 a year, on average, including extra pay for additional hours and performance. They can also be paid extra for private work - but not all do it.\n\nTheir pay has fallen 27% since 2008, once the Retail Price Index (RPI) measure of inflation is taken into account.\n\nOnce changes to tax and pension contributions are factored in, the shortfall is 35%, the BMA says.\n\nBut the government says it has acted on the BMA's request for pension reform, increasing the tax-free threshold on pensions contributions.\n\nConsultants plan more industrial action, on 24 and 25 August, unless a pay deal is agreed.\n\nDr Vishal Sharma, who chairs the BMA consultants committee, said the strikes were \"a last resort\" and the union had \"been left with no choice\".\n\nHe said: \"The responsibility for this industrial action lies squarely at the door of the government. It still does not need to go ahead.\n\n\"We are deeply disappointed that since our ballot result, in which 86% of consultants voted to strike, we have not had a single meeting with the secretary of state and that the prime minister has now apparently closed the door to negotiation, when negotiation is the only route out of this dispute.\n\n\"Patient safety is an absolute priority for consultants, which is why we gave six weeks' notice of these strike dates.\"\n\nClear processes were in place to help safeguard patient care during the strike, Dr Vishal Sharma added.\n\nBut the prime minister's official spokesman implored consultants \"to be clear-eyed about the risk to patients\".\n\n\"They should be in no doubt that this does have the capacity to cause patient harm\" and \"does nothing to help us collectively cut waiting times\", he said.\n\nThe government says 6% is \"very much in line\" with private-sector rises.\n\nThe spokesman said: \"These are highly paid individuals receiving a significant pay increase, so we would ask them again to think again.\n\n\"It is not too late to avoid the damage that this would do to patients and to the wider health service.\"\n\nAlongside strikes, hospitals have faced other challenges to return to full capacity since the Covid-19 pandemic, including:\n\nAt the end of May, 7.47 million people were waiting to start routine hospital treatment - up from 7.42 million a month earlier and nearly three million more than before the pandemic - the highest number since the measure was introduced, in August 2007.\n\nOne in 20 has been waiting more than a year - although the NHS is close to eliminating waits of more than 18 months.\n\nAre you a consultant with a view on the strike?

No fatalities or injuries have been reported, but abouy 50 homes have been destroyed as a result of the fire.\n\nDave Rockwood, a spokesperson with the Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources, told reporters on Wednesday that the fire appears to be \"very fast moving\".\n\nMr Rockwood said firefighters have spotted flames as tall as 60 to 90m.\n\nThe fire is significantly larger than the average seen during an entire fire season in Nova Scotia, said Lucas Brehaut, a wildfire researcher with the Canadian Forest Service.\n\n\"Last year was quite high, at about just over 3,000 hectares burned,\" Mr Brehaut told the BBC. The Shelburne County fire, by comparison, is more than five times that size.\n\nHe added the high flames reported by firefighters are an indication of how strong and rapid the wildfire's spread has been.\n\nMore than 6,000 people have been evacuated from the region, the local Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) division said.\n\nThey are in addition to another 16,400 people who were evacuated from a suburban area nearby Halifax due to a smaller, 836-hectare wildfire that has been burning since Saturday and has destroyed around 200 homes and structures.\n\nOn Wednesday, Nova Scotia officials increased the fine for breaking the provincewide burn ban - a restriction on outdoor fires - to C$25,000 ($18,000; \u00a314,800) - a massive jump from C$237.50.\n\nYour device may not support this visualisation\n\nOfficials said that smaller fire is more than 50% contained as of Thursday morning, but are fearful the flames may spread due to hot weather in the forecast.\n\n\"We are still dealing with a very dangerous and volatile situation,\" said David Steeves, a spokesperson with the Department of Natural Resources, adding the temperature could climb above 30C (86F) later in the day.\n\nOfficials said rain is not forecast for the region until Friday, and that they remain unsure on when residents can return to their homes.\n\nCanada's federal government also announced on Thursday that it will be sending more resources to help Nova Scotia battle the flames.\n\nThis includes military personnel, as well as additional firefighters to help relieve those who have been working on the ground for days.\n\nMore than 300 firefighters from the US and South Africa are heading to Canada in the coming days. Some will be sent to battle fires in Nova Scotia, while others will be sent to battle ongoing fires in Canada's western province of Alberta.\n\nThey will join firefighters from Australia and New Zealand who are already on the ground.\n\nThe massive fire in Shelburne County has destroyed around 50 homes and forced the evacuation of 5,000 residents\n\nNova Scotia is seeing an unusually active wildfire season this year, Mr Brehaut said. It is part of a wider trend in Canada where the fire season has had an earlier start than normal.\n\nOfficials say that the number of wildfires across the country is on par with the 10-year average, but the amount of land burned - around 2.7m hectares in total - is unprecedented.\n\nThe fires have had an impact as far as the US, where air quality warnings were issued in Rhode Island and Massachusetts on Wednesday.\n\nSome people in Boston have reported smelling smoke outside, according to reports in local media, while photos have shown a hazy sky over New York City on Tuesday as a result of the fires.\n\nNova Scotia officials said it remains unclear how the two fires started.

Starmer: Tories arguing over Johnson list while people worry about cost of living\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer has accused Rishi Sunak of being \"too weak\" to block Boris Johnson's honours list.\n\nThe former PM handed out awards to some of his closest aides from the Covid era in a list published last week.\n\n\"That means that those who threw a Downing Street party the night before the late Queen sat alone at her husband's funeral will now receive awards from the King,\" Sir Keir said.\n\nMr Sunak insisted he had acted \"in line with established conventions\".\n\nAnd - in a jibe at Sir Keir's own title - he said: \"I'd expect a knight like him to understand that.\"\n\nThe list of Mr Johnson's nominees included his former head of operations, Shelley Williams-Walker, who was reportedly the DJ at a Downing Street gathering on the eve of Prince Philip's funeral. She was made a dame.\n\nFormer director of communications Jack Doyle and press adviser Rosie Bate-Williams, who issued some of Mr Johnson's denials about Covid rule-breaking, were given CBEs.\n\nMr Johnson has accused Mr Sunak of blocking some of his other nominations, including a peerage for close ally Nadine Dorries, something firmly denied by Downing Street.\n\nMr Sunak said last week that he was not prepared to do what Mr Johnson wanted over peerages, adding: \"If people don't like that, then tough.\"\n\nAt Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir - who was knighted in 2014 for his past role as director of public prosecutions - asked why \"for all his tough talk\" Mr Sunak had signed off on Mr Johnson's list.\n\nHe repeated his call for an immediate general election, accusing the Conservatives of getting their priorities wrong.\n\n\"All across the country, people are worried about their bills, the price of the weekly shop and the spiralling mortgage rates,\" said the Labour leader.\n\n\"So why has the Tory party spent this last week arguing over which of them gets a peerage?\"\n\nMr Sunak denied interfering in Mr Johnson's nominations for honours, in line with what he said was a \"long-held convention\" that had been followed by prime ministers of both main parties.\n\n\"My predecessors may not have agreed with Labour's choices of Tom Watson or Shami Chakrabarti, but the same precedent stood then as it does now. And I'd expect a knight like him to understand that,\" said the prime minister.\n\nSir Keir responded: \"Honours should be for public service not Tory cronies.\"\n\nRishi Sunak insists he did not interfere in the honours process\n\nHe accused the PM of ensuring \"those who spent their time helping cover up Johnson's lawbreaking are rewarded by becoming lawmakers for the rest of their lives\".\n\nMr Sunak asked why the Labour leader had put former MP Tom Watson, \"who spread vicious conspiracy theories that were totally and utterly untrue\", forward for a seat in the Lords.\n\nHe was referring to the now Lord Watson's previous support for fantasist Carl Beech, who wrongly accused several high-profile politicians and military officers of murder and child sex abuse in 2014.\n\nCommons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle intervened to warn Mr Sunak about his comments.\n\n\"Can I just say to the prime minister, you shouldn't criticise other members,\" he told the PM.\n\n\"Also, you're not responsible for the other parties. You are the prime minister that is answering the questions - not asking the questions.\"\n\nLord Watson used his maiden speech in the Lords in December last year to apologise for his role in promoting false sex abuse claims.", "Facial recognition firm Clearview has run nearly a million searches for US police, its founder has told the BBC.\n\nCEO Hoan Ton-That also revealed Clearview now has 30bn images scraped from platforms such as Facebook, taken without users' permissions.\n\nThe company has been repeatedly fined millions of dollars in Europe and Australia for breaches of privacy.\n\nCritics argue that the police's use of Clearview puts everyone into a \"perpetual police line-up\".\n\n\"Whenever they have a photo of a suspect, they will compare it to your face,\" says Matthew Guariglia from the Electronic Frontier Foundation says. \"It's far too invasive.\"\n\nThe figure of a million searches comes from Clearview and has not been confirmed by police. But in a rare admission, Miami Police has confirmed to the BBC it uses this software for every type of crime.\n\nClearview's system allows a law enforcement customer to upload a photo of a face and find matches in a database of billions of images it has collected.\n\nIt then provides links to where matching images appear online. It is considered one of the most powerful and accurate facial recognition companies in the world.\n\nHoan Ton-That, founder and CEO of Clearview AI, speaking with the BBC\n\nThe company is banned from selling its services to most US companies, after the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) took Clearview AI to court in Illinois for breaking privacy law.\n\nBut there is an exemption for police, and Mr Ton-That says his software is used by hundreds of police forces across the US.\n\nPolice in the US do not routinely reveal whether they use the software, and it is banned in several US cities including Portland, San Francisco and Seattle.\n\nThe use of facial recognition by the police is often sold to the public as only being used for serious or violent crimes.\n\nIn a rare interview with law enforcement about the effectiveness of Clearview, Miami Police said they used the software for every type of crime, from murders to shoplifting.\n\nAssistant Chief of Police Armando Aguilar said his team used the system about 450 times a year, and that it had helped solve several murders.\n\nHowever, critics say there are almost no laws around the use of facial recognition by police.\n\nMr Aguilar says Miami police treats facial recognition like a tip. \"We don't make an arrest because an algorithm tells us to,\" he says. \"We either put that name in a photographic line-up or we go about solving the case through traditional means.\"\n\nThere are a handful of documented cases of mistaken identity using facial recognition by the police. However, the lack of data and transparency around police use means the true figure is likely far higher.\n\nMr Ton-That says he is not aware of any cases of mistaken identity using Clearview. He accepts police have made wrongful arrests using facial recognition technology, but attributes those to \"poor policing\".\n\nClearview often points to research that shows it has a near 100% accuracy rate. But these figures are often based on mugshots.\n\nIn reality, the accuracy of Clearview depends on the quality of the image that is fed into it - something Mr Ton-That accepts.\n\nCivil rights campaigners want police forces that use Clearview to openly say when it is used - and for its accuracy to be openly tested in court. They want the algorithm scrutinised by independent experts, and are sceptical of the company's claims.\n\nKaitlin Jackson is a criminal defence lawyer based in New York who campaigns against the police's use of facial recognition.\n\n\"I think the truth is that the idea that this is incredibly accurate is wishful thinking,\" she says. \"There is no way to know that when you're using images in the wild like screengrabs from CCTV.\"\n\nHowever, Mr Ton-That told the BBC he does not want to testify in court to its accuracy.\n\n\"We don't really want to be in court testifying about the accuracy of the algorithm\u2026 because the investigators, they're using other methods to also verify it,\" he says.\n\nMr Ton-That says he has recently given Clearview's system to defence lawyers in specific cases. He believes that both prosecutors and defenders should have the same access to the technology.\n\nLast year, Andrew Conlyn from Fort Myers, Florida, had charges against him dropped after Clearview was used to find a crucial witness.\n\nMr Conlyn was the passenger in a friend's car in March 2017 when it crashed into palm trees at high speed.\n\nThe driver was ejected from the car and killed. A passer-by pulled Mr Conlyn from the wreckage, but left without making a statement.\n\nAlthough Mr Conlyn said he was the passenger, police suspected he had been driving and he he was charged with vehicular homicide.\n\nHis lawyers had an image of the passer-by from police body cam footage. Just before his trial, Mr Ton-That allowed Clearview to be used in the case.\n\n\"This AI popped him up in like, three to five seconds,\" Mr Conlyn's defence lawyer, Christopher O'Brien, told the BBC. \"It was phenomenal.\"\n\nThe witness, Vince Ramirez, made a statement that he had taken Mr Conlyn out of the passenger's seat. Shortly after, the charges were dropped.\n\nBut even though there have been cases where Clearview is proven to have worked, some believe it comes at too high a price.\n\n\"Clearview is a private company that is making face prints of people based on their photos online without their consent,\" says Mr Guariglia.\n\n\"It's a huge problem for civil liberties and civil rights, and it absolutely needs to be banned.\"\n\nViewers in the UK can watch the Our World documentary into Clearview AI on BBC iPlayer", "Victoria Amelina was one of Ukraine's most celebrated young writers\n\nThe award-winning Ukrainian writer Victoria Amelina has died from her injuries after a Russian missile hit a pizza restaurant in the eastern city of Kramatorsk on Tuesday.\n\nThe war crimes researcher becomes the 13th person to have died in the attack.\n\nThe writers' association PEN Ukraine said doctors \"did everything they could to save her life, but unfortunately the wound was fatal\".\n\nKramatorsk is under Ukrainian control but is close to Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine.\n\nAmelina, 37, was dining with a delegation of Colombian journalists and writers in the city's popular Ria Lounge when the missile hit.

Why?\"", "Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg's show on GB News is one programme being investigated by Ofcom\n\nThe media expert who drew up the UK's broadcasting rules has urged the watchdog, Ofcom, to decide whether politicians should be allowed to present TV programmes on news channels.\n\nChris Banatvala said no-one foresaw the rise of politician presenters when the rules were being designed in the 2000s.\n\nHe said Ofcom should take \"a view about whether what is emerging is acceptable in terms of due impartiality\".\n\nThe regulator is reviewing its rules around politicians presenting TV shows.\n\nUnder Ofcom's rules, news must be presented with due impartiality, and politicians are not allowed to be newsreaders, interviewers or reporters \"unless, exceptionally, it is editorially justified\".\n\nOfcom says there are no rules against politicians hosting current affairs programmes, as long as they reflect a range of views.\n\nBut there's been a debate about how these rules apply to the growing number of programmes fronted by politicians on GB News and Talk TV, both relatively new channels.\n\nLast month, Ofcom commissioned research into these programmes after receiving hundreds of complaints about politicians presenting shows.\n\nThen this week, the regulator launched two investigations into potential rule breaches on two programmes, including the GB News show presented by the former cabinet minister, Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg.\n\nIn the episode in question, Sir Jacob read out a breaking story about the jury verdict in a civil case involving the former US president, Donald Trump.\n\nWriting in the Telegraph this week, Ofcom's chief executive, Melanie Dawes, said the regulator had a \"crucial role in preserving the integrity of broadcast news\" and a duty to \"ensure our rules remain effective\".\n\nMr Banatvala was Ofcom's director of standards when the regulator's rules around politicians presenting programmes were introduced in 2005.\n\nHe told the BBC that in a changing media landscape, we need \"a grown-up debate about whether and how we want to apply due impartiality to news\".\n\n\"It's evident now that news channels are blurring the boundaries between genuine news, current affairs and opinion,\" he said. \"That may be a good reason for Ofcom to look at these rules in the round.\"\n\nHe added: \"We may need to look at whether these rules are fit for purpose, and whether we need to amend or adjust them.\"\n\nHe said the tenor of programme on some channels in the UK \"is something that's come across the pond from America\".\n\nIt's long been common to see politicians hosting programmes that veer between partisan commentary and news coverage on channels such as Fox News in the US.\n\nThe UK's impartiality rules go back decades and were included in Ofcom's broadcasting code following its creation as the communications regulator in 2003.\n\nIf broadcasters are found to have breached the code, Ofcom has powers to impose fines and other sanctions.\n\nWhen the impartiality rules were drafted, Mr Banatvala said, they were felt to be \"ample and adequate to prevent any programme from using the same political party over and over again\".\n\n\"It wasn't ever envisaged that a news channel would use politicians from the same political party to present programmes, day in, day out,\" he said.\n\nGrilling two Ofcom directors at a meeting of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee in Parliament on Tuesday, SNP MP John Nicolson asked why the regulator was not taking more action over programmes fronted by sitting politicians.\n\nJohn Nicolson suggested Jacob Rees-Mogg's show had \"the grammar of a news programme\"\n\nSingling out Mr Rees-Mogg's programme on GB News, Mr Nicolson said \"every day, he churns out the same pro-Brexit, right-wing stuff\", arguing \"what he's doing is blurring news presenting and commentary\".\n\nHe asked: \"Why don't you act to stop this?\"\n\nKate Davies, Ofcom's public policy director, said the watchdog looks at current affairs programmes \"differently\" to those focused solely on news.\n\nFollowing further frank exchanges, Mr Nicolson said \"we've lost all sight of objective journalism\" and suggested \"we're going to proceed down a route where we end up with awful, American-style ranting at the camera, we're already seeing it, masquerading as news\".\n\nKate Biggs, Ofcom's content policy director, said the media watchdog takes its responsibility on impartiality and accuracy rules \"very seriously\".\n\nShe said the regulator's investigations into programmes \"do set a precedent for other editors\".\n\nTalkTV said it \"will engage with the Ofcom process and looks forward to defending its output.\"\n\nGB News has also been

long awaited counter-offensive had begun.\n\nSeparately, Russia's military said it had repelled a new attack in the eastern Donetsk region on Monday.\n\nBakhmut has for months been at the heart of fierce fighting. It has little strategic value - but is important symbolically both for Kyiv and Moscow.\n\nMonday's claims by Ukraine and Russia have not been independently verified.\n\nIn the early hours of Tuesday, air raid sirens were activated for several hours all over Ukraine. In the capital Kyiv, all missiles - more than 20 - were shot down, city officials said citing preliminary information.\n\nIn a post on social media on Monday, Ms Maliar said that \"despite stiff resistance and the enemy's attempts to hold the their positions, our military units advanced in several directions during the fighting\".\n\nShe said in Orikhovo-Vasulivka and Paraskoviivka, Ukrainian troops gained from 200m to 1,600m (656-5,250ft), while in Ivanivske and Klishchiivka they advanced between 100m and 700m (330-2,300).\n\nAll four villages are located within several kilometres of Bakhmut. The battle for the city in the Donetsk region has been the longest and bloodiest of the war.\n\nIn a video address late on Monday, President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked Ukrainian fighters for delivering \"the news we are expecting\" on the Bakhmut direction.\n\n\"The enemy knows that Ukraine will win,\" he said.\n\nThe Russian paramilitary group Wagner had claimed to have captured the city in late May. In recent weeks, some analysts have suggested Kyiv's forces are attempting to encircle Bakhmut and trap Russian units.\n\nA major Ukrainian counter-offensive has been long expected but Kyiv has already said it would not give advance warning of its start.\n\nThere has been a notable increase in military activity, with Ukraine claiming to have made marginal gains elsewhere on the front line.\n\nThe latest reports are being seen as a fresh sign that the expected Ukrainian push may have begun.\n\nA video released by the Ukrainian army claims to show a military vehicle near Bakhmut. The BBC has not verified the date of the image\n\nMeanwhile, the Russian defence ministry said on Monday that a new attack by Ukrainian forces in the Donetsk had been repelled.\n\nIn a statement quoted by state-run media, It said the attacking side suffered heavy casualties, and that 28 tanks - including eight German-made Leopards - were destroyed. This has not been verified by the BBC.\n\nWagner boss Yevgeniy Prigozhin publicly mocked the Russian defence ministry, describing its statement as \"wild fantasy\".\n\nThis comes a day after Moscow said a Ukrainian \"large-scale offensive\" in the Donetsk region had begun on Sunday - but was unsuccessful. Ukraine's military said it had no information about such a major attack in the region.\n\nVideo of what Russia said was the battle in Donetsk showed military vehicles under heavy fire in fields. Russia claims it killed 300 troops and destroyed 16 tanks.\n\n\"We do not have such information and we do not comment on any kind of fake,\" a Ukrainian army spokesperson told Reuters.\n\nThere has been a significant increase in Ukrainian messaging on when and how their counter-offensive could take shape.\n\nUkraine has been planning such a move for months. But it has wanted as much time as possible to train troops and to receive military equipment from Western allies.\n\nForeign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said his country now had enough weapons for a counter-offensive but would not comment on whether it had begun, Reuters reported.\n\nOfficials in Kyiv have warned against public speculation over the offensive, saying it could help the enemy.\n\n\"Plans love silence. There will be no announcement of the start,\" the defence ministry said in a recently posted video.

I found this astonishing.\"\n\nHugh Grant told the Leveson Inquiry in 2011 that his flat had been broken into and that a story shortly afterwards had given details of the inside.\n\nIn the statement, he said: \"I had no evidence that this burglary was carried out or commissioned on the instruction of the press, let alone The Sun\".\n\nHe also learned that private investigators specialising in \"blagging\" medical information by ringing hospitals had also been paid to find out about the birth of his daughter to Tinglan Hong, his former partner.\n\n\"Although we did our best to keep this information out of the public domain, we suspected that it was leaked by the hospital to the media\", he said.\n\nHowever the recent disclosures convinced him The Sun had been behind the targeting of his private life.\n\nHe said News UK \"considered itself above the law and is using the law now in a way I believe it was never intended, that is to further cover-up and conceal what it has done.\"\n\n\"I strongly believe that cannot be allowed to happen and that what it has done must be brought to light.\"\n\nMr Justice Fancourt said another legal hearing would be needed in early July before he could deliver his judgement.", "Beethoven, who suffered from several ailments, had asked for his body to be studied\n\nA US businessman has donated fragments of what is believed to be Ludwig van Beethoven's skull to a Vienna university for study.\n\nPaul Kaufmann said he felt \"very privileged to be able to return the Beethoven skull fragments, which I inherited, to where they belong\".\n\nAn Austrian coroner said the fragments, which have already been studied in the US, had \"great value\".\n\nThe composer suffered ill health all his life and died in the city in 1827.\n\nThe businessman said he found the fragments in 1990, in a small box with \"Beethoven\" scratched on it inside a family safety deposit box held by a French bank.\n\nIt is thought that Mr Kaufmann's great-great-uncle Franz Romeo Seligmann, a Viennese doctor, received the fragments in 1863 after Beethoven's bones were exhumed for study.\n\nThere are 10 fragments in total, including two bigger pieces - one from the back of the head and one from the right side of the forehead.\n\nMr Kaufmann shows the fragments to journalists at the Medical University of Vienna\n\nThe Rector of Vienna's Medical University, Markus Mueller, said that it was of paramount importance to handle the remains in an ethically responsible way.\n\n\"It's about finding the right balance between understandable public interest and respect for a deceased person,\" he said.\n\nAustrian coroner Christian Reiter said the fragments were \"really valuable material\" that they hoped to continue to research over the coming years. \"That was Beethoven's wish too,\" he added.\n\nBeethoven, was born in Bonn in December 1770 and died on 27 March 1827.

Well, not this time.\n\nHis opponent - Kemal Kilicdaroglu - was just four percentage points behind him. No doubt President Erdogan will be reflecting on that as he starts his third term in office.\n\nThis strategic Nato nation has chosen its path, most voters opting for a seasoned autocrat rather than an untested democrat in the form of Mr Kilicdaroglu.\n\nThe opposition leader ran his campaign as Mr Nice Guy, initially promising a new spring for Turkey. He later swerved right, vowing to send all refugees home. That won his some extra support from nationalists, but not enough.\n\nTurkey's Islamist leader Mr Erdogan has a bond with his followers that goes back 20 years. Many are religious conservatives like him. They have stuck with him through thick and thin - and hyperinflation - giving him five more years.\n\nAs the run-off result was announced, the streets of the capital Ankara were a kaleidoscope of Turkish flags, blaring car horns, and cheering Erdogan supporters. Huge numbers flocked to his custom-built presidential palace with its 1,000 plus rooms.

Let the world hear this. He is the leader who defied the entire world and taught the entire world a lesson.\"\n\nThat's a key part of his appeal here: Mr Erdogan is a strong leader, a latter-day Sultan who does not bow down.\n\nThe message of the election is that many here prefer a tough guy to a nice guy.\n\nNow he is newly emboldened. The country's opposition is badly bruised, and the Kremlin is celebrating.\n\nThis is the outcome President Vladimir Putin wanted - no surprises that he was one of the first to offer his congratulations to the Turkish leader. Mr Putin did what he could to tilt the scales in his favour, including postponing a $600m (\u00a3486m) payment for Russian natural gas.\n\nMr Erdogan entered the contest with many advantages: his street smarts, his common touch, and his control of 90% of the media here.\n\nIn his victory speech he insisted that \"only Turkey was the winner\" - but he lost no time in attacking the opposition and the LGBTQ community.\n\nBoth may now be targeted even more, and human rights and free speech could be further eroded in the years to come. There are few checks and balances here, and Turkey's longest-serving leader is not known for his restraint.\n\nThose who wanted change here - almost 48% of the voters - will be disappointed, and perhaps fearful.\n\nMany predict there will be more religion and less freedom in the public life of this secular republic, which will mark its centenary in October.\n\nTurkey is now a divided nation with a broken economy. Critics say the president has no solution for either.\n\nAnd where does the election result leave Turkey's neighbours and its Nato allies?

The prosecution in Yekaterinburg says former Mayor Yevgeny Roizman took part in a YouTube discussion last August where he negatively assessed the way Russian troops were being used in Ukraine.\n\nIn an interview with the AFP news agency last summer, Mr Roizman said: \"Something horrible is happening, evil is prevailing. Absolutely vile evil is suddenly prevailing before our eyes.\"\n\nUntil his arrest in August, the ex-mayor was one of the last remaining prominent opposition politicians in Russia who had not been killed, detained, or forced out of the country.\n\nIn interviews, he was often asked why he had not fled Russia, like so many of his fellow activists. \"I can't flee,\" he said shortly after the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. \"It is unacceptable for me to do that.\"\n\nEarlier this week, in yet another show of Russia's crackdown on dissenting opinions over the invasion, an interior ministry worker was sentenced to seven years in jail for spreading \"fake news\" about the war in a personal phone call.\n\nSergei Klokov was detained a few weeks after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in March 2022 when his phone was tapped.

Scientists analysing the vapes said they were the worst lab test results of their kind they had ever seen.\n\nThe Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) now says the UK government should \"without a doubt\" ban disposable e-cigarettes.\n\n\"Youth vaping is fast becoming an epidemic among children, and I fear that if action is not taken, we will find ourselves sleepwalking into a crisis,\" said Dr Mike McKean, paediatric respiratory consultant and RCPCH vice-president.\n\nHealth experts stress that smoking cigarettes, which contain tobacco, is still the single biggest cause of preventable illness and disease in the UK.\n\nHowever, Dr McKean said vaping products were \"not risk-free\" and research on them was \"still very much in its infancy\", meaning it was not possible to predict the long-term impacts on young people's lungs, hearts and brains.\n\nWhat's your reaction to a possible ban on disposable vapes?

This means they would cost a similar amount to rechargeable, reusable vaping products - but still much less than a pack of cigarettes.\n\nIt also wants rules to be tightened around the way vapes are promoted in shops, to reduce their appeal to children.\n\nThe vaping industry also says a ban on single-use vapes is not the answer.\n\nUK Vaping Industry Association (UKVIA) director general John Dunne said: \"Strong, targeted action directed at those illegally selling vape products to children is the way forward.\"\n\nGreen Alliance, an independent think tank, said disposable vapes wasted resources like lithium which are needed for batteries to power electric cars, and recycling them was costly.\n\nIt called current government proposals to restrict marketing and end free giveaways to children \"laughably inadequate\".\n\nA spokesperson for the Department for Health and Social Care in England said: \"We are taking bold action to crack down on youth vaping through the \u00a33m illicit vapes enforcement squad to tackle underage sales to children.\"", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Deborah Meaden: 'I woke up, climate change is happening in the here and now'\n\nThe wildfires in the southern Mediterranean have brought climate change to the top of the news agenda and have also whipped up a storm on social media.\n\nPeople calling for climate action, like Dragons' Den star Deborah Meaden, have been branded as alarmists. Meaden has publicly faced down critics on online platforms like X (formerly called Twitter) when accused of exaggerating climate change. Despite the hostility her public stance generates, it is an issue she is passionate about.\n\n\"The climate change problem is here and now,\" Meaden told the BBC at a recent event. People are increasingly waking up to the idea and this has big implications for businesses, she says.\n\n\"People are joining the dots,\" says Meaden.\"We can't assume we've got time to sort the planet any more. It was probably about six or seven years ago when I really woke up to the fact.\"\n\nHowever, she is of course well known not as a scientist or social activist, but as a famous face of business. Much of the damage to the planet driving climate change is caused by big businesses, as they supply us with the necessities - and luxuries - of modern life.\n\nThey are increasingly being forced to rethink their policies, thanks to consumer pressure, says Meaden.\n\n\"Consumers have woken up to the power they have in their pockets in the past five or six years,\" she says.\n\n\"They are telling businesses, you need to change the way you do things. They want to make sure businesses are reducing their planetary impact.\n\n\"And businesses will - and do - listen to the consumer.\"\n\nSome large companies have been caught out greenwashing - paying lip service to sustainability, but not putting it into practice - but many do genuinely want to commit to change, Meaden told Bupa's eco-Disruptive event in London, which earlier this month ran a competition for start-ups in the sustainability sector.\n\nWhile consumers can influence big businesses to become more responsible through their spending power, Meaden reckons, it is actually new breeds of small, start-up companies that will bring those businesses the radical ideas they need to change their ways.\n\nWhile large companies have resources and deep pockets, they don't always have the ability to focus on the kinds of new ideas that have to be experimented with, to become more sustainable, she argues.\n\nLarge, public companies can also face inertia on climate change because they are subject to the demands of their shareholders, who are focused on short-term profits.\n\nThis is where start-ups come in. They are more agile and their small teams can laser-focus on new ideas, says Meaden.\n\nMany start-up founders with bold ideas aren't in fact trying to be the next all-conquering Facebook. From the outset, they are looking to be acquired by a larger company after they've proved their potential - making life-changing amounts of money for the founding members when they sell.\n\nSince large companies are on the lookout for green solutions right now, they are interested to acquire start-ups that can solve their sustainability issues for them, in areas like supply chains, waste or energy consumption.\n\nSo there is a good market now for start-ups to be in this space and drive the sustainability agenda at scale, says Meaden.\n\nMany of these kinds of start-ups were represented at the eco-Disruptive Live event.\n\nAustralian start-up Cassava Bags won the overall competition, taking prize money of \u00a3200,000.\n\nIt had developed a disposable, carrier bag that looks like it is made of plastic, but in fact dissolves in water.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

The bags dissolve in boiling water in around one minute, or over several days if left in the ocean, say the founders, though they can also withstand rain.\n\nThe start-up hopes that supermarkets will adopt their bags, though subsidies will be required to help them compete with established plastic rivals whose products are significantly cheaper.\n\nAnother firm at the event, Energym, makes exercise bikes which generate electricity that can be stored in a battery, allowing gyms to use their own electricity rather than buy it from the grid.\n\n\"I have been concerned about sustainability and climate change for a very, very long time,\" says Meaden, \"but it was always something that was going to happen way into the future.\n\n\"But of course it isn't, it's happening now.\"", "Last week Nadine Dorries said she would resign her Mid Bedfordshire seat with immediate effect\n\nFormer cabinet minister Nadine Dorries has said she will not resign until she gets more information on why she was denied a peerage.\n\nThe Boris Johnson ally announced last Friday she would be standing down as MP for Mid Bedfordshire \"with immediate effect\".\n\nMs Dorries accused Rishi Sunak's team of removing her name from Mr Johnson's resignation honours list.\n\nIn a tweet, she said she had requested all correspondence around her removal.\n\nMs Dorries said she had put in Subject Access Requests to the House of Lords Appointments Commission (HOLAC), Cabinet Secretary and the Cabinet Office.\n\nSubject Access Requests allow an individual to receive a copy of all their personal data held by a government department.\n\nFreedom of Information expert Martin Rosenbaum has pointed out that under the Data Protection Act 2018, the right of access to personal data does not apply to data processed for the honours system.\n\nIn a multi-tweet thread Ms Dorries said she had requested copies of WhatsApp messages, texts, emails and meeting minutes. relating to the process of her nomination for the House of Lords\n\nOnce she receives them she will \"take the time to properly consider the information I am provided\", Ms Dorries added.\n\nShe went on to say it is \"absolutely my intention to resign\" but \"this process is now sadly necessary\".\n\nShe added that her \"office continues to function as normal and will of course continue to serve my constituents\".\n\nBefore Ms Dorries' announcement, No 10 said it was important for her constituents to have \"certainty\".\n\n\"It is obviously unusual to have an MP say they will resign with immediate effect and for that not to take place,\" the prime minister's press secretary added.\n\nMr Johnson also announced he was leaving Parliament on Friday, ahead of a Commons report expected to accuse him of misleading MPs over the Partygate scandal, which is due to be published on Thursday.\n\nNigel Adams, one of Mr Johnson's other close allies, stood down as an MP on Monday, following reports his name was also removed from the list of approved peerages.\n\nThe by-elections to replace them were triggered on Wednesday, with 3 July or 20 July the possible polling dates.\n\nWhile Ms Dorries remains a member of Parliament, she can turn up in the House of Commons chamber to make her views known.\n\nAnything she says would be covered by parliamentary privilege, allowing her to be outspoken on any issue, without fear of legal consequences.\n\nThe Conservatives - who are trailing Labour in national polls - wanted to conclude swift campaigns before Parliament's summer recess and for any political pain from the by-elections to be short and sharp.\n\nBut if Ms Dorries keeps her party waiting, she could force them into a potentially divisive by-election later on - for example, ahead of the autumn party conference season.", "Last updated on .From the section Boxing\n\nAnthony Joshua returned to winning ways with a unanimous points victory over Jermaine Franklin at London's O2 Arena.\n\nThe British heavyweight, 33, controlled the contest against the durable American but it was not the explosive early finish many expected.\n\nTwo judges scored it 117-111 and one 118-111 to Joshua.\n\nTempers flared after the final bell as the two fighters squared up to each other, prompting their teams to enter the ring and be separated by security.\n\u2022 None 'Joshua doesn't want to do it any more' - Whyte analysis of fight\n\nIt is Joshua's first win in more than two years, having lost consecutive bouts to WBA (Super), IBF and WBO world champion Oleksandr Usyk.\n\n\"No knockout, so no good.

His seven previous fights at the venue ended inside the distance, but this was not vintage Joshua.\n\nA boisterous sellout crowd, including popstar Liam Payne and journalist Louis Theroux, were in attendance, eager to see whether Joshua - still one of the biggest names in British boxing - remained a force in the division.\n\nAway fighter Franklin - who earlier travelled on the London underground to the arena due to traffic - entered the ring first to huge jeers. Joshua followed, marching to the ring with a look of determination.\n\nJoshua started strongly, taking the centre of the ring and doubling up on the jab to pierce Franklin's guard, with quick feet to stay out of range of any advances. A thudding straight right got Franklin's attention at the start of the second.\n\nThe Michigan fighter - who shed 23lbs since losing to Whyte - came out strong in the third, growing in confidence and showing he was not there to make up the numbers.\n\nJoshua landed a telegraphed uppercut from range in the fourth and both men found success in the fifth.\n\nBoxing fans and pundits felt Joshua needed to win in style against a fringe world-level contender. Even 'AJ' himself said he needed to make a statement, but it was starting to look as if that would not be the case.\n\nFranklin began to tire into the second half of the fight, Joshua landing a sharp hook on the inside. The two men stood their ground and exchanged glares after the bell in the seventh.\n\nBut when the AJ of old would have pushed for a knockout, the fight instead became scrappy as both men were warned for holding in the ninth.\n\nJoshua enjoyed more success in the following round, stunning Franklin with a terrific uppercut. He grinned and, perhaps for the first time in the fight, the former unified heavyweight champion was reminiscent of his old self.\n\nA complacent Joshua was reminded of the danger Franklin poses, taking a couple of clean shots, but out-jabbed his opponent, who continued to clinch, in the final rounds.\n\nIn scenes not too dissimilar to his outburst when he lost to Ukrainian Usyk in August, Joshua once again allowed his frustration to get the better of him after the final bell.\n\nHe tapped Franklin on the back of the head, who reacted and then AJ decided to wrestle with his opponent, before Franklin's corner got involved. The melee continued outside the ring, pushing back the barriers separating the teams from media.\n\n\"Last time I grabbed the mic, it was a bit chaotic,\" Joshua said afterwards. \"I'm calm - I appreciate everyone coming out this evening.\n\n\"Inside the ring, it is a different energy so I apologise to those watching.\"\n\nFans wanted to see the return of the old Joshua. The ferocious, ruthless combination puncher who stopped his first 20 opponents inside the distance.\n\nBut the last time Joshua won in the first half of a fight was in 2016, against Eric Molina. Perhaps that is testament to the level of opponents he has faced since then.\n\nFranklin - a fringe world level contender - gave Joshua a harder night's work than most expected. Nevertheless, the pressure was on. A defeat for Joshua would have been difficult to come back from.\n\nDespite an underwhelming performance, Joshua is keen on a match-up with Fury.\n\n\"I would be honoured to fight for the WBC heavyweight championship of the world,\" Joshua said.\n\n\"If he's listening, he knows my promoter, we've had dialogue before, so let's continue this. We ain't getting any younger.\"\n\nPromoter Hearn added: \"There may be an opportunity to do the Tyson Fury fight next.\n\n\"If it is there, it'll be difficult for AJ not to take it. He may think he will never get it.\n\n\"The sensible thing is to have another fight with Derrick James to improve; Dillian Whyte is a great option. The first fight was epic. It is all about timing. Money?

The Morecambe fighter will be looking for a high-profile opponent for his next fight.\n\nJoshua-Fury is arguably the most lucrative bout for both men.

We are at the stage where promising further action is not enough.\n\n\"The scale of the climate impacts we are seeing make clear that resilience to climate change should be a much greater national priority.\"\n\nThe UKCCC noted almost all the measures are re-announcements of existing commitments from other plans like the Environment Act.\n\nTrudy Harrison, minister for climate adaptation, said: \"We are absolutely serious across government. What we have set out today is billions of pounds of investment to protect the most vulnerable communities.\"\n\nShe said the government had taken on board the climate change committee's comments.\n\n\"There's always more to do. This is a five-year plan,\" she said.\n\nNew proposals in the plan from government include:\n\nAs global temperatures continue to rise the risk of extreme events in the UK such as high heat, winter flooding and storm surge increases.\n\nLast year, during the most intense heat wave the country has ever faced, there were 25,000 wildfires from the moorlands of greater Manchester to the gardens of east London. Hospitals struggled to cope - around 3,000 more deaths in the over-65s than usual and 20% of operations were cancelled.\n\nAlongside flooding, overheating is one of the biggest risks the UK population face from climate change.\n\nDr Chloe Brimicombe, researcher in heatwaves at University Graz, told the BBC: \"The reason that it's a massive risk is that it causes significant health issues especially for vulnerable groups. It causes health issues like dehydration, heat stress which they might need to go to hospital for.\"\n\nThe government wants contractors who build new schools and hospitals to implement cooling measures like shaded windows, green roofs and more open spaces. But there is no new legislation or funding for updates to existing homes to make sure they are protected.\n\nUnder a scenario where global temperatures rise by 2C all homes in England and Wales are at risk of overheating according to energy consultants Arup.\n\nIn dense urban areas like London, Manchester and Birmingham populations are particularly at risk.\n\nRezina Chowdhury, Labour deputy leader of Lambeth council in south London told the BBC: \"Our communities feel the effects disproportionately with poorer households... and our residents live in flats without outside space.\"\n\nCity dwellers struggled with overheating homes last year during the UK heatwave\n\nBut she said that there is no secure funding: \"It is like Hunger Games where people are having to fight for pots of money to do the work we should all be doing.\"\n\nLocal authorities are being offered advice and information from a new climate advice service to help them tailor their response.\n\nThis move has been welcomed by Linda Taylor, environment spokesperson for the Local Government Association, the national body for authorities in England and Wales.\n\n\"But while access to Local Authority Climate Data could provide some good learning and understanding for councils, they crucially need the resources and money to take action on their findings,\" she said.\n\nThe UK is not just vulnerable to heat at home but also abroad. The UK only produces 16% of its fruit and 50% of its vegetables domestically, relying on imports, mostly from Europe, to fulfil the shortfall. Therefore any extreme weather events in Europe could effect the supply here.\n\nEarlier this year the UK experienced shortages of cucumber, tomatoes and other popular vegetables after poor weather in Spain, and now the same region is baking under an intense heatwave. which could further damage crops.\n\nThe UKCCC recommended in March that the government require, by law, all large food companies to assess the climate risks to their supply chains.\n\nThe government did not propose this in the NAP. It said that a new Food Security Strategy would be produced for next year but industry was best placed to deal with the issue.\n\nLow rainfall in Italy and Spain last year led to shortage of key vegetables in the UK\n\nFlooding and storms are the other major risk the UK currently faces. Memorable events such as Storm Arwen wreaked havoc with UK homes and key infrastructure. In November 2021, it left one million British properties without power and internet supply.\n\nThere are no targets in the plan for improving the strength of the communications sector, which was a key ask of the UKCCC in March - but said Ofcom would look at issuing new guidance to companies to prepare for climate change.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "Boots is changing the way its loyalty card works by offering discounts on more of its own-brand products but cutting the points earned per pound.\n\nThe health and beauty retailer said that from May, holders of the Advantage Card would collect 3p worth of points for every \u00a31 spent, instead of 4p.\n\nThe move comes when many retailers' costs are increasing amidst record rises in energy bills and overheads.\n\nOne retail analyst said shoppers \"want their jam today rather than waiting\".\n\n\"Loyalty schemes where shoppers collect points to use later are losing appeal as shoppers want the best price and discount right now, and the cost of running these schemes is also significant,\" said Catherine Shuttleworth.\n\nAfter the changes, every point people earn will continue to be worth 1p to spend in Boots.\n\nBoots added that customers would be able to save 10% in store on 6,000 of its own-brand products.\n\nIt said customers would also save on hundreds of products with its Price Advantage scheme in a move which was to \"make things stretch that little bit further\". Price Advantage allows Boots card holders exclusive access to lower prices on certain products.\n\nIt said the move was in response to customer feedback.\n\nOn its website, Boots said: \"We understand that more customers are looking to access instant savings, so offering 10% off our Boots own brand range will give even more opportunities to save.\n\n\"We understand that many customers still love saving up their points for big purchases in the future, so will continue to offer 3p worth of points for every \u00a31 spent at Boots.\"\n\nThe retailer said students would continue to receive a 10% discount storewide, alongside the extra 10% for Boots branded products.\n\nRecent research suggests that shoppers have been switching away from branded products at certain retailers and opting for own-brand equivalents to save money at the till, as inflation - the rate at which prices rise - reaches record highs.\n\nMs Shuttleworth said Boots is competing with other High Street firms to hold on to shoppers amid rising cost pressures, and that points \"really aren't enough\" anymore.\n\n\"Boots is faced with shoppers that are looking for better prices and great value and are shopping far and wide to find it from discount retailers like B&M and Home Bargains to supermarkets and online,\" she told the BBC.\n\n\"Younger shoppers in particular are well versed in unlocking immediate discounts offered to them.\"\n\nShe said that with the cost-of-living crisis, shoppers are increasingly savvy about making their money stretch as far as possible.\n\n\"Changes to schemes and devaluation of points can mean that shoppers choose to give up collecting their points and simply shop elsewhere,\" she said.\n\nAnnich McIntosh, managing editor of Loyalty Magazine, said Boots had been the \"last bastion of high-value loyalty points\".\n\n\"It always had been one of the more generous schemes since the start of the loyalty push,\" she said.\n\nThe shift to instant discounts was common across retailers, she said, allowing companies to continue to collect extremely valuable data about spending habits, while keeping their own costs down.\n\nThey could also use the power of differential pricing to push their own-brand products, and have branded products supplied cheaper, to enhance profits.", "Lhermitte seen in court before her conviction in 2008\n\nA Belgian woman who murdered her five children has been euthanised at her own request, 16 years after the killings.\n\nGenevieve Lhermitte killed her son and four daughters, aged three to 14, in the town of Nivelles on 28 February 2007, while their father was away.\n\nShe then tried to take her own life but failed, and ended up calling emergency services for help.\n\nThe 56-year-old was sentenced to life in prison in 2008, before being moved to a psychiatric hospital in 2019.\n\nIn Belgium the law allows for people to choose to be euthanised if they are deemed to be suffering from \"unbearable\" psychological, and not just physical, suffering that cannot be healed.\n\nThe person must be conscious of their decision and be able to express their wish in a reasoned and consistent manner.\n\n\"It is this specific procedure that Mrs Lhermitte followed, with the various medical opinions having been collected,\" her lawyer said.\n\nPsychologist Emilie Maroit told the RTL-TVI channel that Lhermitte likely chose to die on 28 February in a \"symbolic gesture in respect for her children\".\n\n\"It may also have been for her to finish what she started, because basically she wanted to end her life when she killed them,\" the psychologist said.\n\nThe quintuple murders in 2007, and the subsequent trial, rocked Belgium.\n\nDuring the trial Lhermitte's lawyers argued she was mentally disturbed and should not be sent to prison. But the jury found her guilty of premeditated murder and sentenced her to life in jail.\n\nIn 2010 Lhermitte filed a civil lawsuit demanding up to three million euros (\u00a32,655,840) from a former psychiatrist, claiming his \"inaction\" failed to prevent the murders, but she ended up abandoning the legal battle after 10 years.\n\nIn 2022, some 2,966 people died via euthanasia in Belgium, an increase of 10% compared to 2021.\n\nCancer remains the most common reason, but officials said in nearly three out of four requests the patient presented \"several types of suffering, both physical and psychological\".\n\nSince 2014, Belgium has allowed children to be helped to die as well as adults, if they are terminally ill and in great pain and if they have parental consent.", "Harvey Evans's aunt Hayley Murphy says his family are determined to get \"justice\" for him\n\nThe aunt of one of two teenagers killed in an e-bike crash says she believes the police are to blame for their deaths.\n\nHayley Murphy, whose nephew Harvey Evans, 15, died alongside best friend Kyrees Sullivan, 16, said the family were determined to get \"justice\".\n\nSouth Wales Police said officers were following the boys before the crash, which sparked a riot.\n\nThe force said it and the police watchdog are continuing to investigate.\n\nHarvey Evans, 15, and Kyrees Sullivan, 16, died in a bike crash on Monday\n\nCCTV from minutes before the accident in Ely, Cardiff, on Monday evening showed a police van driving at a distance behind the two boys, but the force said its nearest vehicle was half-a-mile away when the bike crashed.\n\n\"They were two children who were chased to their death by South Wales Police,\" Ms Murphy told the BBC after a vigil was held in memory of the two boys on Friday.\n\nMs Murphy, whose sister is Harvey's mother, claimed her nephew had been \"arrested 30 times over the last two years, and there's been not one charge that's stuck\".\n\nShe alleged in one case officers had visited his family home, after a police officer was assaulted, but doorbell video footage showed he was at home at the time.\n\nShe claimed on another occasion when officers believed he had done something wrong, the family were on holiday and \"he wasn't even in the country\".\n\nBalloons were released at a vigil held for them on Friday\n\nShe described Harvey as \"chopsy and cheeky\" but also \"so lovable\".\n\nMs Murphy called him \"a typical teenager\u2026 out and about with all his friends and sees the police all the time\".\n\nShe explained how Harvey, a fan of e-bikes and scooters, had told his father he was going to take Kyrees home on his electric bike, which was an early 16th birthday present, after they had had tea together.\n\n\"Harvey had only just had this bike and didn't want to lose it. He turned back and the police gave chase,\" she alleged.\n\nMs Murphy said the riot began after family members were waiting near the crash scene to find out if the boys were still alive as CPR was being carried out.\n\nTributes were attached to a fence in memory of the two boys\n\nHarvey's grandmother, Dawn Rees, said they believed some people involved in the riot had no local connections and \"didn't care what they were doing and rioting for\".\n\nNine people in total have been arrested in connection with the riot - of whom at least five are from the Cardiff area - after the police investigation looked at more than 180 pieces of body worn footage.\n\nDetectives have said more arrests are expected.\n\nMs Murphy said the family had faced an agonising wait to get the police confirmation they feared about the boys' deaths.\n\nShe said: \"They came to the house around four hours after it happened, about four hours in total, and they said 'there have been two fatalities but we cannot confirm who they are'.\n\nTheir deaths sparked a riot in the Ely suburb of Cardiff\n\n\"We knew it was Harvey, but we didn't get told until the family liaison officer came at around two o'clock the following day.\n\n\"How can you treat a family of a young boy like that?\"\n\nThe two women also blamed rioters for delaying emergency services from removing Harvey and Kyrees' bodies from the scene of the crash.\n\n\"Those boys lied on that floor for 10 hours.

It claims to have worked with more than 16,000 people including the son of a former Mexican president and Hollywood actresses such as Mack.\n\nProsecutors say Mack helped recruit and groom women as sexual partners for the group's leader, Keith Raniere. Though Raniere, 62, was at the top of this structure and the only man, Mack served as one of his top female deputies.\n\nFemale recruits were allegedly branded with his initials and expected to have sex with him in exchange for becoming a part of the group, which was based in Albany, New York.\n\nThe news of Mack's release was initially reported by the New York newspaper Albany Times Union.\n\nMack, who was arrested in 2018, was facing as much as 17 years in prison but saw her sentence reduced after providing evidence to help prosecutors pursue their case against Raniere.\n\nIn 2020, he was sentenced to 120 years in prison for multiple crimes, including forcing women to be his sexual \"slaves\".\n\nBefore her sentencing, Mack apologised to those she said had been harmed by her actions, calling her involvement with the group \"the biggest mistake and regret of my life\".\n\n\"I am sorry to those of you that I brought into Nxivm,\" she said. \"I am sorry I ever exposed

trying to remove Adam Price as leader, leaked texts seen by BBC Wales said.\n\nMessages from the party's Luke Fletcher said colleagues were discussing whether Mr Price was fit to lead the party over a failure to deal with allegations of bullying and sexual impropriety.\n\nIt comes after a review found a culture of \"harassment, bullying and misogyny\".\n\nThe Senedd group said it shared the party's distress about the findings.\n\nBut it did not respond to questions about whether Mr Price still had the wider party's support.\n\nMr Price has refused to stand aside following Nerys Evans's report, and said he would be \"abdicating\" his responsibility if he quit.\n\nHe apologised to all those who experienced or witnessed unacceptable behaviour and said the party was a product of the society it was trying to change.\n\nThe WhatsApp exchanges between a former party staff member and the Member of the Senedd for South Wales West detail discussions last November over a plan to replace Mr Price.\n\nThe texts suggested Mr Price lost the confidence of several party figures, who were keen to install the Ynys M\u00f4n MS, Rhun ap Iorwerth, as leader.\n\nIn one of the messages, Mr Fletcher said he had \"spoken to Rhun\" and \"told him that I'd back him\".\n\nHe went on to say that a meeting had taken place among a number of Plaid Cymru MSs concerning the leadership on 15 November.\n\nThat was about a week after the South Wales Central MS, Rhys ab Owen, was suspended from the party's Senedd group.\n\nHe is under investigation by the Senedd's standards watchdog, over an alleged breach of the code of conduct.\n\nMr Fletcher said that during the meeting there was \"a reluctance to push the button\u2026 but I think people can be persuaded\", before adding that \"things are still yet to come out\".\n\nIn response to later messages, he added he was \"sick of everyone pretending everything is OK\" and that Plaid Cymru was \"the definition of hypocrisy\".\n\nMr ap Iorwerth admitted \"major changes\" were needed in messages to the staffer sent around that time.\n\nHe went on to say: \"It is clear to me that we are at a critical juncture for the party.\"\n\nIn later exchanges, Mr Fletcher also references the North Wales MS, Llyr Gruffydd, saying he \"doesn't think there's a way back for Adam\".\n\nFollowing publication of the Plaid Cymru report, a former Welsh Labour cabinet minister called for Plaid Cymru's co-operation deal with the Welsh government to end.\n\nKen Skates MS, a former economy minister, said he did not want to deal \"with bullies, misogynists or anyone who discriminates against others\".\n\nPlaid Cymru is in a co-operation deal with the Welsh government, which sees Labour ministers work with the party on a range of policies including childcare and free school meals.\n\nAsked on the BBC Politics Wales programme if she agreed with Mr Skates, Climate Change Minister Julie James MS said: \"I think it's a matter for Plaid Cymru.\n\n\"They will want to look very carefully at that report and it's a matter for them to put their own house in order.\n\n\"The difficulty with the Welsh system, of course, is that we have to work with someone and, actually, co-operation agreements across the parties in Wales are things that have brought stability to Wales and support from a large number of people.\n\n\"So, it's about more

There had been years of vicious infighting, and agonies over antisemitism.\n\nBy any measure, restoring the party to a credible political organisation is an enormous accomplishment.\n\nWithout question, Sir Keir has been helped by the Conservatives' rolling series of crises - the chaos of Boris Johnson's downfall, the market meltdown of Liz Truss' several dozens of days in office, and now the profound problems in the economy.\n\nThe Starmer smile is on show more often at PMQs\n\nBut even with the much more ordered regime of Rishi Sunak, Labour has managed to stay significantly ahead in the polls, making important advances in local elections, and soon to be tested again in a flurry of by-elections you can read about here.\n\nAs a result of a solid and sustained opinion poll lead, Labour is thinking not just about how to win anymore, but in detail about what they would do if they get there.\n\nSir Keir is the first to warn of complacency, repeatedly telling his team to fight \"like they are five points behind\".\n\nBut there is no question he is mulling over how he would govern.\n\n\"He is thinking, I want to be ready and I want to be a good prime minister,\" says an ally.\n\nAnother source tells me he is already using a red box system, like a prime minister would.\n\n\"Everything goes in by late afternoon with a hard deadline and he spends his evenings poring over papers, ideas, drafts, or submissions\", all dealt with by the morning.\n\nBut it may be more than a year still until he has the chance to swap the bag that holds his papers for a real government red box. And there is still an awful lot that could go wrong.\n\nSensing the opportunity and worrying it could go south is \"scary as hell\", says a shadow minister.\n\nThere is a widespread awareness that Labour's massive lead now is likely to narrow as a general election comes closer.\n\nThe Tories \"aren't dead\", says one shadow minister and their party HQ has one of the most successful campaign fighting records in the Western world.\n\nAnd the first rule of politics is always, learn to count.\n\nLabour's poll lead over the Conservatives is expected to narrow\n\nA whopping national poll lead does not automatically translate into winning many more seats in a general election, as one Labour MP in a tightly-fought constituency worries - \"The biggest danger is that you rack up big majorities and don't seal the deal with enough of the seats\".\n\nSir Keir's team can't change the fact that Labour fell so far behind in 2019 that winning an overall majority isn't just climbing a mountain, more scaling the Himalayas. They also of course, like any political organisation, can't control unforeseen events that can shape how voters make decisions.\n\nNot much however is without risk, even issues that ought to be within Starmer's control.\n\nFirst, one source half jokes what could go wrong is \"The Labour Party\"!\n\nThe danger is \"it loses discipline and focus and makes unforced errors\", they tell me.\n\n\"It's been 20 years since we won a general election\", they add, and the party simply doesn't have the habit.\n\nA shadow minister says \"we have to hold our nerve\" and not make any mistakes, or give into pressure from the left of the party.\n\nThe leadership has been accused of control freakery, trying to suppress the left, expelling party members unfairly.\n\nBut a source says the danger of disputes with the left is \"way down the risk register\", the focus has to be on potential voters.\n\nOne shadow minister believes Sir Keir thinks \"I can't be in government and dependent on these people\".\n\nThe logic goes that battles with the left over who gets to run as a Labour MP now are well worth having to avoid having an awkward squad that could make life difficult in Parliament later. Particularly if Labour has to try to run the country as a minority government or with a tiny majority.\n\nThe Labour leader has his eyes firmly on Number 10\n\nThe leadership's most central strategy is one of the reasons why there are grumbles on the left - and that is risky too.\n\nAs we heard from Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves last week, and Sir Keir is likely to argue in our interview on Sunday morning, Labour has put watching the pennies strictly at the top of its list.\n\nWith the economy in serious trouble, they share some of the ethos of the current government, however uncomfortable that might feel, that now is not the time for huge spending or huge tax cuts.\n\nThat discipline means the party has dropped or watered down some promises that activists loved - the plan for free university tuition in England, delaying big spending proposals for green projects.\n\nNo-one is getting promises from Rachel Reeves' cheque book, as we talked about last week.\n\nIt has had an effect on the leader's reputation.\n\nOne union leader says Starmer has \"had the blame for shifts in policy that have made him look a bit shifty\".\n\nAnd there is concern that all the talk of keeping a lid on spending on what Keir Starmer once described as \"good Labour things\" will lead voters to wonder what Labour really would offer.\n\nAnother senior figure tells me: \"The economy is on its knees - sitting there saying, we are very sensible, who is going to listen to that?\"\n\nThere is also a question of the political argument being made.\n\nKeir Starmer and his team have made the case for many years that the deep roots of many of the country's problems relate to the austerity of the coalition years, when George Osborne kept strict limits on spending.\n\nBut if Labour's plan does not include filling in the holes financially to undo that damage, does that stack up?\n\nOne of his MPs, not from the far left of the party, ponders \"it is pretty hard to criticise this government without acknowledging the damage that austerity has caused, and then not say you would spend more\u2026 no-one really believes that he wouldn't spend more\". As Labour approaches its National Policy Forum next week, an important powwow with activists and unions, calls for more ambition, like from the leader of the Unite union, Sharon Graham, may become familiar.\n\nStressing the importance of reforming and improving public services, and getting the economy growing without spending billions extra and certainly not borrowing without good reason.\n\nLabour's top team is stuck like glue to the idea that they have to show they would keep a tight grip on public spending, almost as if they are traumatised by past elections when the Conservatives have run the attack that they would splash the cash.\n\nA senior figure suggests the leadership is \"very nervous about making any wrong moves on the economy\".\n\nBut those at the top believe the messiness of the past few months, particularly the rising cost of mortgages, make discipline even more important.\n\nOne shadow minister says: \"The mortgage stuff hits homeowners in places like Stevenage and Luton, swing voters, who are looking for people who are serious on the economy.\"\n\nBut insiders acknowledge turning discipline into electoral excitement might not be easy. Making promises about abstract reform doesn't necessarily get voters running to the polling booths.\n\nAs Parliament packs up for the summer, there is no question that Sir Keir Starmer has cause to be confident.

Prof Smith told BBC News that ministers had consistently said that they were fully supportive of full association with the Horizon programme once the EU gave the green light.\n\n\"There is a great deal of concern and anxiety at the rumours that there is now a desire to renegotiate our association of the Horizon programme.\n\n\"It will mean that the continuing uncertainty will drift on and we will have more of the problems we are already seeing, such as a brain drain and the exclusion of leadership from major programmes,\" he said.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen said talks on Horizon would begin immediately once the Windsor agreement was implemented\n\nThe assumption was that if differences over the Northern Ireland Protocol could be resolved, the UK would fully re-join the Horizon programme under terms similar to those it had before Brexit.\n\nBut BBC News understands that Mr Sunak is keen on an alternative research programme put together by ministers, known as \"Plan B\". This would be a UK-led programme involving collaboration with non-EU as well as European nations. It was developed in case a research agreement could not be reached with the EU.\n\nSources say that while some aspects of the Horizon programme are appealing to the Prime Minister, such as grants to individual scientists, he believes that larger institutional grants favour France and Germany and may not represent good value for money.\n\nProf Sir Adrian Smith: ''anxiety and concern'' among the UK's leading scientists\n\nWhile no decision has yet been taken, one option under consideration is for a complete renegotiation of the terms of the Horizon agreement currently in place with the EU. This would allow the UK government to sign up to those parts of the programme that appealed, then use the remainder of the money that would otherwise have been spent on Horizon on its Plan B.\n\nProf Smith told BBC News that he didn't believe that such a plan would work.\n\n\"There is an assumption that we are in charge of the renegotiation and that we can have the good bits and get out of the not so good bits. All history shows that this kind of cherry-picking and negotiation Is not up for grabs.\n\n''The whole thing is a package and the point is that the entire programme has in the past been good for the UK,\" he said.\n\nProf Sarah Main of the Campaign for Science and Engineering said that the UK's previous fruitful membership of the EU programme had attracted investment from the hi-tech companies her organisation represents and that her members want nothing short of the full association that is currently on the table.\n\n\"We want to see this with all speed. If the Prime Minister has not been close to the discussion, we need to make clear that that is the message from the research community and in the UK's economic interest to secure this deal as quickly as possible,\" she said.\n\nProf James Wilsdon, a specialist in research policy at University College London, said the failure to commit to the current arrangement on offer from the EU showed that the government was not listening to the science community.\n\n\"To keep the whole UK research system hanging on in limbo for two years while we ostensibly seek association; then to walk away when we finally have it in our grasp would, I think, be for many UK scientists, the final straw,\" he said.\n\nHorizon Europe is a collaborative research programme involving Europe's leading research institutes and hi-tech companies. EU member nations each contribute funds which are then allocated to individuals or organisations by expert scientists based on the merit of research proposals.\n\nThe government negotiated associate membership of the programme in the withdrawal agreement following Brexit, because it felt it was important for the UK to be involved. But the EU went back on its part of the deal after disputes emerged over the Northern Ireland Protocol and British involvement in the prestigious programme has been left in limbo ever since.\n\nThe agreement of the Windsor Framework last week paved the way for the UK to re-join.\n\nWhen the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Mr Sunak were asked about re-entry to the Horizon programme at a joint press conference, Ms von der Leyen enthusiastically remarked that it was \"good news for scientists and researchers, in the European Union and in the UK,\" but Mr Sunak did not comment.\n\nHe also failed to make a commitment to the programme when asked at Prime Minister's Questions this week and the FT has reported that he was holding back on committing to the programme.\n\nDowning Street has been approached for comment but has not responded.", "Stormzy is helping to fund more black or mixed-race heritage undergraduates at Cambridge University\n\nGrime artist Stormzy has pledged to support a further 36 black students studying at Cambridge University over the next three years.\n\nEach will receive a \u00a320,000 annual scholarship in a continuing partnership between banking group HSBC UK and the musician's charity, #Merky Foundation.\n\nIt is five years since the Stormzy Scholarships were launched.

Carole Mundell: \"Liquid water we think is a precondition for habitability\"\n\nEarth has taught us that life requires four essential inputs: liquid water, nutrients of some kind, an energy source, and time - an extended period of stability during which biology can get a foothold and establish itself.\n\nWe've long considered Mars to be the most likely candidate to host extra-terrestrial life, if not today then sometime in its distant past.\n\nBut for astrobiologists - scientists who study the possibility of life elsewhere in the Universe - the ice-covered moons of Jupiter and also Saturn are really starting to pique their interest.\n\nTiny alien-looking worms can be found at deep-sea volcanic vents on Earth\n\nThese worlds may be in the cold, outer reaches of the Solar System, far from the Sun, but they could just be able to satisfy the four inputs - even for a supply of energy. It's not light and warmth from a star, but the constant gravitational squeezing and pushing the giant planets exert on the moons.\n\nIt's this flexure that provides the means to keep water in liquid form and could also drive the kind of volcanic vent systems on ocean floors that Prof Mundell mentions and which some scientists think could have been the origin of life on Earth.\n\n\"If I were a betting man, I'd probably put my money on Europa having life that is alive, that exists today,\" says Prof Lewis Dartnell, an astrobiologist at the University of Westminster. \"The chances of that are much higher than finding extant (living) life on Mars today.\"\n\nArtwork: The US space agency will launch the Clipper spacecraft next year\n\nThe US will be launching its companion mission, known as Clipper, next year.

suggesting less of a link between the decoration and local events.\n\nAnalysis of the human remains inside the pot suggested the deceased person was aged over 40, and may have come from overseas.\n\nGlynn Davis, a senior curator of Colchester and Ipswich Museums, told The Observer that the vase may have belonged to a sponsor of the gladiatorial fight depicted.\n\nThe item is due to go on display at Colchester Castle from 15 July, along with other significant Roman finds.\n\nColchester is one of England's most historic cities, having become the capital of Roman Britain soon after the conquest of AD 43, and known as Camulodunum.\n\nPrevious discoveries have indicated the presence of Roman-era gladiators in Britain, even if the evidence of arena combat here has been more thin.\n\nSkeletons from an ancient \"gladiator cemetery\" went on display in York in 2011, although archaeologists said they could not be certain the men were fighters.", "One of the world's biggest carmakers has warned it may have to close UK factories if the government does not renegotiate the Brexit deal.\n\nStellantis, which owns Vauxhall, Peugeot, Citroen and Fiat, had committed to making electric cars in the UK, but says that is under threat.\n\nIt warned it could face tariffs of 10% on exports to the EU due to rules on where parts are sourced from.\n\nIn response to the comments, Rishi Sunak said he believed in Brexit.\n\n\"I voted for Brexit, I believe in Brexit,\" the prime minister told reporters while travelling to the G7 Summit of world leaders in Japan.\n\nMr Sunak cited what he called \"Brexit benefits\" he introduced as chancellor and reforms to retained EU law which he said would save business a billion pounds a year.\n\nHe did not directly address concerns made by Stellantis, but a spokesperson said the government was \"determined\" UK car making would remain competitive.\n\nIt is the first time a car firm has openly called for a renegotiation of the terms of the Brexit trade deal, and the BBC understands all major manufacturers in the UK have raised similar concerns with government.\n\nStellantis warned that if the cost of electric vehicle manufacturing in the UK \"becomes uncompetitive and unsustainable, operations will close\".\n\nThe car giant called on ministers to come to an agreement with the EU to maintain the status quo until 2027, with a review of arrangements for manufacturing parts in Serbia and Morocco.\n\nLabour's Sir Keir Starmer said the country needed \"a better Brexit deal\" to ensure firms such as Vauxhall could continue operating in the UK.\n\nSources said Business and Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch had a \"constructive\" virtual meeting with Stellantis on Wednesday, with them \"cautiously optimistic\" after conversations with the EU which recognised a deal was in both parties' interest.\n\nJust two years ago, Stellantis, which is the world's fourth biggest car maker, said the future of its Ellesmere Port and Luton plants was secure.\n\nBut the firm told a House of Commons inquiry the current trade rules posed a \"threat to our export business and sustainability of our UK manufacturing operations\".\n\nFrom next year, 45% of the value of an electric car should originate in the UK or EU to qualify for trade without tariffs. This will rise to 65% in 2027.\n\nStellantis said it was \"now unable to meet these rules of origin\" due to the recent surge in raw material and energy costs.\n\nIf the government cannot get an agreement to keep the current rules until 2027, exports of its UK-made cars \"would be subject to 10% tariffs\" from next year, it said.\n\nThis would make the UK an uncompetitive place to manufacture cars compared with Japan and South Korea, it added.\n\n\"To reinforce the sustainability of our manufacturing plants in the UK, the UK must consider its trading arrangements with Europe,\" Stellantis said.\n\nA government spokesperson said ministers will take \"decisive action\" to ensure future investment in the industry but Labour said car makers had been let down by a \"government in chaos\".\n\nTrading rules around electric cars were one of the very last issues settled in the Brexit negotiations in 2020.\n\nBut Stellantis warned the current rules meant manufacturers could relocate abroad, pointing to BMW's decision to make its new electric Mini in Germany and Honda's closure of its plant in Swindon.\n\nAlong with trade barriers, a core problem remains the lack of electric car battery plants in the UK, when compared with the US, China and EU which are pouring subsidies into electric car making.\n\nFormer Nissan executive and battery start-up businessman Andy Palmer said the UK was \"running out of time\" to develop its own battery manufacturing industry.\n\nEarlier this week, French President Emmanuel Macron hosted Tesla's Elon Musk, who hinted he might invest in a battery plant - or gigafactory - in France.\n\nMeanwhile, the Spanish government is currently trying to woo the UK's biggest car manufacturer, Jaguar Land Rover, into building a gigafactory in Spain.\n\nWith the rules due to tighten again in 2027 experts believe UK exporters will find it impossible to sell cars overseas tariff free unless they can source batteries domestically.", "Last updated on .From the section Premier League\n\nTottenham returned to the Premier League's top four for the first time since February by beating Nottingham Forest.\n\nThe hosts opened the scoring inside 15 minutes when Forest defender Murillo diverted Timo Werner's cross into his own net.\n\nForest levelled 12 minutes later through Chris Wood, who finished off Anthony Elanga's cross.\n\nBut centre-back Micky van de Ven restored Tottenham's lead in the 52nd minute with a thunderous shot from the edge of the penalty area that found the top corner.\n\nAnd six minutes later, Pedro Porro netted a third for Spurs, hammering in James Maddison's pass across goal.\n\nVictory meant Tottenham moved above Aston Villa on goal difference, having played one game fewer.\n\nNottingham Forest stayed 17th, only outside of the drop zone thanks to their superior goal difference over Luton.\n\u2022 None How did you rate Spurs' performance?

two offences at a fast-food restaurant in February 2021, and another at woodland in Deal in 2020.\n\nThree remaining counts will not be pursued by the prosecution and will be left on file, the Old Bailey heard.\n\nThe 50-year-old entered the pleas by video-link from Frankland Prison.\n\nCouzens, who had a long grey beard and wore a grey tracksuit, is serving a whole-life sentence at the Durham prison for the kidnap, rape and murder of 33-year-old Ms Everard in March 2021.\n\nOn both 14 and 27 February 2021, Couzens exposed his genitals to staff at the drive-in fast food restaurant. He is said to have looked straight at the workers while sitting in his car as he paid for his food.\n\nMrs Justice May told the Old Bailey: \"The female staff were shaken, upset and angry.\"\n\nStaff took a registration number after the second incident and identified the car from CCTV as a black Seat. It was registered to Couzens, who had in any case used a credit card in his name to pay.\n\nThis happened four days before the then-serving officer with the Met Police used his position to trick Ms Everard into his car.\n\nThe significance of Wayne Couzens' guilty pleas should not be underestimated: we now know he was a serial sex offender before he murdered Sarah Everard.\n\nBut more importantly his number-plate was given to Met Police officers after he exposed himself in February 2021.\n\nIt's fair to say if the police had carried out the correct checks they would have realised he was a police officer, but he was free, just days later, to murder Sarah Everard using his status as a policeman.\n\nMany women have said the police don't take indecent exposure seriously enough despite the fact it's known often to lead to more serious offences.\n\nIt's fair to say this was a missed opportunity to stop Wayne Couzens.\n\nDet Ch Insp Katherine Goodwin, who led the team which originally investigated the murder of Sarah Everard, said Couzens had \"tried to frighten and demean\" his victims, \"but they have only shown strength and dignity in reporting him and supporting this investigation\".\n\n\"I would like to thank them for their patience, co-operation and help throughout the case,\" she added.\n\nDeputy Assistant Commissioner for professionalism in the Met, Bas Javid, said: \"We know the public will, understandably, be sickened at yet more grotesque crimes by Couzens.\n\n\"The process of flushing out the corrupt and the criminal from the Met will be slow and painful, but is necessary and we will continue to do so.\"\n\nLast year, Couzens failed in an attempt to have his whole-life term reduced, when the Lord Chief Justice ruled the crimes against Ms Everard were so exceptional the tariff should stand.\n\nCouzens is due to be sentenced for the indecent exposure offences on 6 March.\n\nFollow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

The PM on migrants crossing the Channel: \"The plan is working, numbers are down for the first ever time.\"\n\nTwo new barges have been purchased to house up to 1,000 migrants, the prime minister has announced, as he said plans to tackle small boats crossing the Channel are working.\n\nRishi Sunak said the location of the new barges will be announced soon.\n\nIt comes as the PM said the numbers making the crossing by small boats were down by a fifth since last year.\n\nHe said a returns deal with Albania had led to 1,800 people being sent back to the country.\n\nThe first barge to hold asylum seekers is due to dock in Portland Port this month, and will house 500 adult males claiming asylum in the UK.\n\nMr Sunak said the barges \"will relieve pressure on local communities\" and spaces in hotels being used to house migrants.\n\nBefore the barges arrive, the government will do \"extensive engagement with local communities\" Mr Sunak added.\n\nOn Sunday, dozens of protesters gathered around Portland port to ahead of the arrival the Bibby Stockolm barge, claiming the location was chosen without consulting locals.\n\nNearly 3,000 asylum seekers will also be housed on two military sites in Wethersfield and Scampton by the autumn, Mr Sunak said.\n\nSpeaking in Kent, Mr Sunak said his plan to stop small boat crossings \"is starting to work\".\n\nMr Sunak said crossings were down 20% between January and May this year, compared to the same period last year.\n\nEarlier, the Home Office told the BBC Mr Sunak had been speaking about January to March this year, when in fact crossings fell only fell by 17% compared to the same period in 2022.\n\nHowever, the department has now said he was referring to the figures for January to May after all. These show 7,610 arrivals, compared to 9,607 in the same period last year, a fall of almost 21%.\n\nThis is compared to a 30% increase in the number of migrants entering the rest of Europe illegally over the same period, according to Mr Sunak.\n\nHowever, the biggest increase in the numbers arriving by small boats in 2022 happened during the summer months. This is typically when the weather is best for crossing the Channel.\n\nA revised deal with the French authorities to stop migrant crossings prevented 33,000 illegal crossings last year, Mr Sunak added.\n\nUnder the new agreement, signed by Home Secretary Suella Braverman in November, the UK paid France \u00a363m this year to invest in CCTV, policing and detention centres in French ports to try to prevent crossings.\n\nThe prime minister added: \"With grit and determination, the government can fix this and we are using every tool at our disposal.\"\n\nAn estimated 500 male migrants will be housed on the Bibby Stockholm\n\nAnd Mr Sunak said the UK had gone from accepting about one in five Albanian asylum cases to just one in 50.\n\n\"So far this year, the number of Albanian small boat arrivals has fallen by almost 90%\" year-on-year, he said.\n\nLabour Leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the government promoting a \"policy that doesn't work\" which is \"costing a fortune for the taxpayer\".\n\nSir Keir said the promise of further measures to tackle the crisis was \"like Groundhog Day\" as crossings continue this year.\n\nHome Office figures show about 7,600 people had been detected crossing the Channel so far this year.\n\nIn total, 45,755 migrants crossed the Channel in 2022, the highest number since figures began to be collected in 2018.\n\nCrossings are heavily influenced by the weather and the summer months typically see higher numbers making the journey.\n\nThe government's Illegal Migration Bill is currently being debated in the House of Lords. The bill, which will place a legal duty on the home secretary to detain and remove those arriving in the UK illegally, has been heavily criticised by peers.\n\nThe measures, unveiled in March, are a key part of prime ministers plan to stop small boats crossing the English Channel - which he has made a priority ahead of the next general election.", "Coolio recorded eight studio albums and won an American Music Award and three MTV Video Music Awards\n\nThe death of US Grammy-winning rapper Coolio in September 2022 was due to the effects of fentanyl and other drugs, his manager has said.\n\nJarez Posey said the musician's family had been informed about the findings by the Los Angeles County coroner.\n\nThe artist was found unresponsive on the bathroom floor of a friend's LA house six months ago.

He got very close to our faces.\"\n\nMs Lynn says singer Till Lindemann reacted angrily when she told him she would not have sex with him\n\nShe claimed that shortly afterwards he picked her and several other girls to attend a pre-concert party, where she was given alcohol and told Till Lindemann would like to meet her during a brief intermission once the concert began.\n\n\"I said: 'Why? Why me? Is this some sort of a sex thing?' [He replied:] 'No, no, no, nothing like that, nothing like that at all.

I'm not doing that.'\"\n\nThe singer, she said, reacted angrily and left.\n\nMs Lynn, who has emphasised on social media she wasn't sexually assaulted, said her memory of the evening was \"blurry\" and she recalls feeling nauseous and vomiting at a party after the concert.\n\nShe believes her drink was spiked and that she was the victim of an \"organised system of funnelling girls\".\n\n\"I was groomed, 100 percent, no doubt in my mind. I was groomed for sex,\" she said.\n\nRammstein initially reacted to her claims last month by releasing a statement online in which the band fully denied them.\n\nOn Saturday, after other women came forward with allegations, the band published another statement, saying that they took the accusations extremely seriously.\n\nThey condemned any kind of assault but asked their fans not to \"pre-judge\" them.\n\nA spokesman for the band has subsequently told the BBC that it is now investigating the claims and interviewing staff and crew as part of the enquiry.\n\nRammstein is currently performing several concerts in Germany.\n\nAfter demands from several politicians, including the German families minister, Wednesday's show in Munich went ahead with no \"Row Zero\".\n\nThere were specialist \"awareness teams\" on hand to assist anyone in a vulnerable position.\n\nThe spokesman added that the band had severed contact with the Russian woman accused of helping to select women for \"Row Zero\".\n\nThey said private after-show parties with Till Lindemann had been cancelled.", "The search is taking place along the River North Esk near the village of Edzell in Angus\n\nA search is under way for a 15-year-old boy who got into difficulty in the River North Esk near the village of Edzell in Angus.\n\nSpecialist search teams are searching the area near Gannochy Bridge.\n\nEmergency services were first made aware of the incident at about 17:10 on Saturday.\n\nPolice Scotland said emergency crews remained in attendance and searches were ongoing.

He is hoping that a scheme by Rhondda Cynon Taf council for free travel in March may encourage people back, making cuts unnecessary.\n\nBut he said if passenger numbers remain the same as they are now \"then we would definitely need some form of support to carry on running\".\n\nMarge Jones said the 90 service was a \"lifesaver\".\n\nPassengers on the number 90 say it's a \"vital\" service for them to get into Pontypridd.\n\nMany use their bus passes and say it's their main way of getting about. Susan Rice-Bevan, 62, from Llantwit Fardre, hops on two or three times a week.\n\n\"It is quite a trek up to the main road to use another service which a lot of elderly people in the community find quite difficult,\" she said.\n\nIf it were lost \"it would isolate a lot of people who can't get out to do their shopping, who perhaps haven't got the facilities to do online shopping\".\n\nJohn Wornham, 92, from Church Village said: \"It's essential to me to get to the village because the only way I can get up the hill is on the bus.\n\n\"Once a week I go to Ponty on a Wednesday to do my shopping in the market.\"\n\nMarge Jones, 70, from Tonteg was taking her husband Derryck, 72, to a medical appointment.\n\n\"It's a lifesaver,\" she said. \"We rely on this.\"\n\nThe chief executive of a bus industry body that represents 50 members said 15-20% of the bus network might be lost once the funding ends.\n\nGraham Vidler, of the Confederation of Passenger Transport, said while larger firms might be able to downsize and adjust, there would be more severe consequences in rural areas and \"in areas which are particularly dependent on people travelling on their free bus passes\".\n\nSmall and medium firms could face leaving the market altogether, he said.\n\nMr Vidler estimated that while fare paying passenger figures are down 10% on the start of the pandemic, bus pass passenger figures are down 35%.\n\n\"We will see some communities, particularly in rural West Wales, cut off from the bus network altogether\", he warned.\n\nHe said larger firms would also need to reduce services which could mean reduced frequencies, fewer services at weekends, later starting times and earlier finishing times.\n\n\"If you suddenly take that scheme away you get that cliff edge effect where all of a sudden a large proportion of the network suddenly becomes unviable\".\n\nHe argued that more of the \u00a360m cash earmarked for concessionary fare subsidy in the budget should reach bus firms.\n\nLee Waters, speaking at the Senedd climate change committee on Wednesday morning, said the government was hoping that \"in exchange for a certain amount of money... we are able to reach agreement on which services are more important than others\".\n\nHe said the Welsh government faces a \"very difficult dilemma that the privatised bus industry has only been able to survive through public subsidy during Covid\".\n\n\"Passenger numbers have not recovered, the farebox has not recovered.\"\n\n\"The reality is, we're going to have to face changes,\" he said.\n\n\"Energy spent on trying to say we should keep things as they are is not well spent energy, because we can't keep things as they are.\"\n\nBut he said he did not know what a core service meant, saying it was hard for bus firms to forecast.\n\nCoach and Bus Operators Cymru (CaBAC), which represents smaller firms, also warned that a reduction in fleet sizes could lead to fewer drivers and vehicles available for home to school transport.\n\n\"The knock-on effect would be widely felt - not only would local bus services be decimated with people unable to travel for employment, shopping, hospital and other important appointments,\" it said.\n\nThe Welsh government said it has provided \"\u00a348m in emergency funding to the bus industry this financial year and approximately \u00a3150m since the beginning of the pandemic\".\n\n\"When we confirmed an initial three month extension of funding earlier this month, we made clear that we need to start to transition away from this emergency style of funding,\" a spokesman said.\n\nHe said plans for franchising, where private firms would have to bid to run services, \"is a key step towards introducing legal powers to deliver a new model for running buses in Wales\".\n\n\"This is a chance for us to deliver better connected services and we will continue to work closely with local authorities, operators and other partners - including Transport for Wales - to build a strong and sustainable bus network for Wales,\" the spokesman added.", "Steve Apelt is travelling across the site on his custom-made novelty bike\n\nGlastonbury veterans who have attended for more than four decades say the festival has not lost its magic.\n\nSteve Apelt, 60, from Chiselborough, Somerset, has been a regular since the early 1980s and first went to Glastonbury aged 21.\n\nHe said he had watched the festival go from \"chaotic\" to \"the most beautiful thing on the planet\".\n\nPat Rogers, 73, who has attended since the 1970s said he still finds \"there's so much to see at Glastonbury\".\n\nMr Apelt said: \"It went through that time when it was a festival when everyone was jumping the fence, and it all became a bit chaotic, to now, which is the most beautiful thing on the planet.\n\n\"Last night, we spent hours just walking around and every corner that you turn there's something else that's so innovative, beautiful, pretty and so many people just love it for that.\"\n\nMr Apelt described the festival as \"the most beautiful thing on the planet\"\n\nHGV driver Ben Rogers, 46, from Wells, who first came to Glastonbury aged one, said it is \"simply the greatest show on earth\".\n\n\"Many say it's too commercial now, but for me, it's still kept that incredible vibe and atmosphere you simply can't explain to anyone who hasn't been,\" he said.\n\n\"Everyone comes and instantly embraces -

El Ni\u00f1o normally doesn't really have a global impact until five or six months into the phase,\" Dr Smith says.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o is the world's most powerful naturally occurring climate fluctuation. It brings warmer water to the surface in the tropical Pacific, pushing warmer air into the atmosphere. It normally increases global air temperatures.\n\nThe average global temperature in June this year was 1.47C above the typical June in the pre-industrial period. Humans started pumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere when the Industrial Revolution started around 1800.\n\nAsked if summer 2023 is what he would have forecasted a decade ago, Dr Smith says that climate models are good at predicting long-term trends but less good at forecasting the next 10 years.\n\n\"Models from the 1990s pretty much put us where we are today. But to have an idea about what the next 10 years would look like exactly would be very difficult,\" he says.\n\n\"Things aren't going to cool down,\" he adds.\n\nThe average global ocean temperature has smashed records for May, June and July. It is approaching the highest sea surface temperature ever recorded, which was in 2016.\n\nBut it is extreme heat in the North Atlantic ocean that is particularly alarming scientists.\n\n\"We've never ever had a marine heatwave in this part of Atlantic. I had not expected this,\" says Daniela Schmidt, Prof of Earth Sciences at the University of Bristol.\n\nPress play to see the map animated.\n\nIn June temperatures off the west coast of Ireland were between 4C and 5C above average, which the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration classified as a category 5 heatwave, or \"beyond extreme\".\n\nDirectly attributing this heatwave to climate change is complex, but that work is ongoing, Prof Schmidt says.\n\nWhat is clear is that the world has warmed and the oceans have absorbed most of that heat from the atmosphere, she explains.\n\n\"Our models have natural variability in them, and there are still things appearing that we had not envisaged, or at least not yet,\" she adds.\n\nShe emphasises the impact of this heat on marine ecosystems, which produce 50% of the world's oxygen.\n\n\"People tend to think about trees and grasses dying when we talk about heatwaves. The Atlantic is 5C warmer than it should be - that means organisms need 50% more food just to function as normal,\" she says.\n\nThe area covered by sea-ice in the Antarctic is at record lows for July. There is an area around 10 times the size of the UK missing, compared with the 1981-2010 average.\n\nAlarm bells are ringing for scientists as they try to unpick the exact link to climate change.\n\nA warming world could reduce levels of Antarctic sea-ice, but the current dramatic reduction could also be due to local weather conditions or ocean currents, explains Dr Caroline Holmes at the British Antarctic Survey.\n\nShe emphasises it is not just a record being broken - it is being smashed by a long way.\n\n\"This is nothing like anything we've seen before in July. It's 10% lower than the previous low, which is huge.\"\n\nShe calls it \"another sign that we don't really understand the pace of change\".\n\nScientists believed that global warming would affect Antarctic sea-ice at some point, but until 2015 it bucked the global trend for other oceans, Dr Holmes says.\n\n\"You can say that we've fallen off a cliff, but we don't know what's at the bottom of the cliff here,\" she says.\n\n\"I think this has taken us by surprise in terms of the speed of which has happened. It's definitely not the best case scenario that we were looking at - it's closer to the worst case,\" she says.\n\nWe can certainly expect more and more of these records to break as the year goes on and we enter 2024, scientists say.\n\nBut it would be wrong to call what is happening a \"climate collapse\" or \"runaway warming\", cautions Dr Otto.\n\nWe are in a new era, but \"we still have time to secure a liveable future for many\", she explains.", "The English National Opera's new home is set to be announced in December\n\nThe English National Opera (ENO) has been given until 2029 to move its headquarters out of London under Arts Council England (Ace) plans.\n\nThe company, currently based at the London Coliseum, will be given \u00a324m to deliver an opera in the capital and establish a new main base.\n\nThe funding, which will be granted between 2024 and 2026, is on top of the \u00a311.5m for 2023.\n\nThe ENO's new home is expected to be announced in December, it said.\n\nThe opera company has been told by the Arts Council to relocate from the capital by 2026 or lose its public funding.\n\nCulture Secretary Lucy Frazer said she welcomed the agreement made with the \"treasured national institution\".\n\n\"I look forward to seeing the plans it develops to make sure more people across the country can experience its fantastic work,\" she added.\n\nThe English National Opera has until 2029 to move out of its main base at the London Coliseum\n\nIn November last year, Ace said it would axe the opera company's \u00a312.6m core annual grant, replacing it with \u00a317m over three years - effectively halving the funding - as part of a plan to relocate.\n\nIt came after the Arts Council was instructed by the government to spread more money beyond the capital.\n\nAfter a backlash, Ace announced in January it would spend \u00a311.5m in 2023 to sustain a programme of work in London, while helping it to start planning for a new base by 2026, with five cities later shortlisted.\n\nThe Arts Council has now confirmed it has extended the deadline to relocate by three years, from March 2026 to March 2029.\n\nEquity has previously said a survey of its members working at the ENO showed more than two-thirds would quit the company - and the profession - if it left London. Many said they had caring responsibilities, partners working, or children going to school in the capital.\n\nThe London Assembly also formally objected in June to the relocation outside of the capital.\n\nIn a joint statement, the opera company and Ace said the longer timeframe to find a new base would mean \"more stability, allow for consultation with staff, more work in London and more time for the ENO to develop partnerships in the new city and to establish a programme there\".\n\nFollow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Variable speed limits are introduced to control traffic flow when there is congestion, or if there is a hazard ahead. These limits are controlled by speed cameras.\n\nSeven of the 14 projects that have been cancelled were going to involve converting stretches of motorway into \"all-lane running\" roads where the hard shoulder is permanently removed.\n\nThey will now remain as \"dynamic\" smart motorways where the hard shoulder can be opened as an extra lane during busy times.\n\nThe construction of two stretches of smart motorway from junctions six to eight on the M56, and from 21a to 26 on the M6, will continue as they are already more than three quarters complete.\n\nSmart motorways were developed to create more capacity and cut congestion on roads, without spending money and causing disruption building news ones.\n\nHowever, they have been criticised by MPs and road safety bodies, including the AA and RAC.\n\nEdmund King, the AA's president, said he welcomed the decision to scrap planned smart motorways and said it was a \"victory for common sense\", calling for the hard shoulder to be reinstated on existing smart motorways, including a permanent red 'X' and new lane markings. He hoped the government's decision marked the end of \"deadly\" smart motorways.\n\nHe added: \"We have had enough coroners passing down their deadly and heart-breaking judgments where the lack of a hard shoulder has contributed to deaths\".\n\nMeanwhile, the RAC called the plans a \"watershed announcement\", saying its research showed that smart motorways were \"deeply unpopular with drivers\".\n\nClaire Mercer, whose husband died on a smart motorway in South Yorkshire in 2019, welcomed the move but pledged to continue campaigning for the hard shoulder to return on every road.\n\nJason Mercer and another man, Alexandru Murgeanu, died when they were hit by a lorry on the M1 near Sheffield after they stopped on the inside lane of the smart motorway following a minor collision.\n\nMrs Mercer said: \"I'm particularly happy that it's been confirmed that the routes that are in planning, in progress, have also been cancelled.

It's been quite a rollercoaster.\"\n\nIt has been \"really quite a stressful situation over the last several months\", he added, but said he still felt that buying the company was the right thing to do.\n\nAfter building a stake in Twitter at the start of 2022, Mr Musk made a takeover offer. But Twitter later sued him after he tried to back out of the deal.\n\nThings are going \"reasonably well\", Mr Musk told the BBC, stating that usage of the site is up and \"the site works\".\n\nThe workload means that \"I sometimes sleep in the office\", he said, adding that he has a spot on a couch in a library \"that nobody goes to\".\n\nAnd he also addressed his sometimes controversial tweets saying: \"Have I shot myself in the foot with tweets multiple times? Yes.\"\n\n\"I think I should not tweet after 3am,\" he added.\n\nAsked about the decision to add a label to the BBC's main Twitter account describing it as \"government funded media\", Mr Musk said: \"I know the BBC is generally not thrilled about being labelled state media.\"\n\nEarlier this week, the corporation contacted the social media giant over the designation on the @BBC account to resolve the issue \"as soon as possible\".\n\n\"The BBC is, and always has been, independent. We are funded by the British public through the licence fee,\" it said.\n\nMr Musk said Twitter was adjusting the label for the BBC to \"publicly-funded\". The change was made several hours later, but the new label was still linking through to a page with information about government and state-affiliated media.\n\n\"We're trying to be accurate,\" he said.\n\n\"I actually do have a lot of respect for the BBC,\" he added, stating that the interview was \"a good opportunity to ask some questions\" and \"to get some feedback on what we should be doing different\".\n\nThe BBC is the UK's national broadcaster and operates through a Royal Charter agreed with the government. It is funded by a licence fee paid by UK households - accounting for \u00a33.8bn ($4.7bn) in 2022, about 71% of the BBC's total income of \u00a35.3bn.\n\nThe rest of the funding comes from its commercial and other activities like grants, royalties and rental income. The BBC also receives more than \u00a390m per year from the government to support the BBC World Service, which predominantly serves non-UK audiences.\n\nDiscussing Twitter's finances, Mr Musk said the company is now \"roughly breaking even\", as most of its advertisers have returned.\n\nHe also said that cutting the workforce from just under 8,000 at the time he bought the firm to about 1,500 had not been easy.\n\nHe admitted he did not fire everybody in person, saying: \"It's not possible to talk with that many people face to face.\"\n\nThe exit of many of Twitter's engineers since Mr Musk bought the company has raised concerns about the stability of the platform.\n\nHe acknowledged some glitches, including outages on the site but he said the outages have not been for very long and the site was currently working fine.\n\nOn buying Twitter: \"It's not been boring. It has been quite a rollercoaster... It's been really quite a stressful situation.\"\n\nOn laying off staff: \"I wouldn't say it was uncaring... If the whole ship sinks, then nobody's got a job.\"\n\nOn profits: \"We could be profitable, or to be more precise, cash flow positive this quarter if things keep going well. I think almost all advertisers have come back or said they are going to come back.\"\n\nOn his controversial tweets: \"Have I shot myself in the foot with tweets multiple times? Yes.\"\n\nOn labelling the BBC as \"Government-funded media\": \"We're adjusting the label to... publicly funded...

WATCH: Former prisoner Marc Conway says his Friday release left him with no time to sort housing, leaving him in breach of bail\n\nPrisoners vulnerable to addiction, mental health issues or homelessness will no longer be released on Fridays under new plans to cut reoffending. One prisoner who breached parole after being released on a Friday says he felt let down by the system. He told the BBC his story and what it says about prisoners at risk of lapsing back into a life of crime.\n\n\"By the time I got to the housing department, it was a Friday afternoon and there was no-one there to see me. I knew the offices wouldn't be open again until the Monday. I was quite fearful of where I was going to stay that night - I didn't want to stay on the streets.\"\n\nMarc Conway was 17 years old when he was released, on a Friday, after three months in HMP Feltham young offenders' institution in London.\n\nWithout anywhere to go, he made what he describes as a \"disastrous mistake\" and stayed with a \"known associate\".\n\nIn doing so, he broke his licence conditions and was recalled to prison to serve out the remaining three months of his sentence.\n\n\"I felt like I had let people down, first and foremost, that I'd been recalled back to prison so soon,\" he said.\n\n\"I was angry, I was resentful of the system. I felt the system had let me down again and I dread to think what I would have done that night if I didn't have somewhere to stay.\"\n\nMarc has served a number of sentences for a range of serious offences, last leaving prison four-and-a-half years ago.\n\nIn 2019, he was one of the people who pinned down the convicted terrorist Usman Khan on London Bridge after Khan had fatally stabbed two people.\n\nMarc Conway was among those who tackled convicted terrorist Usman Khan on London Bridge\n\nMarc now works with the Prison Reform Trust and says that he still sees people having similar experiences to the one he had, two decades on.\n\n\"This happens time and time and time again. People are being released on a Friday and are not being able to access services,\" he said. \"It's not just housing. It could be mental health services, it could be GP services, all sorts.\n\n\"I have known of people who have committed crime just to have somewhere to sleep that night.\n\n\"There's quite an easy solution. You have to go to probation on the day of release. Why can all the services not be under one roof and just stop Friday releases?\"\n\nAround one in three prisoners are released on a Friday, according to research by the charity Nacro.\n\nThey often have just a few hours before services close to meet their probation officer, register with a GP, get housing and sign up for support like Universal Credit.\n\nNacro has run a long campaign to stop Friday releases, saying they are \"setting people up to fail\".\n\nPrison governors are expected to be given the power to end the practice for vulnerable prisoners in England and Wales later this year, after the government backed a Private Members' Bill from the Conservative MP Simon Fell.\n\nUnder the legislation, governors would be able to release those who have mental health issues, substance misuse problems, or who have a long way to travel home, up to 48 hours early following \"strict security checks\".\n\nA similar law was passed in Scotland in 2015 but questions have been raised about how widely it has been used.\n\nPrisons Minister Damian Hinds said leaving custody was a \"very sensitive moment\" and this was a \"simple but, in a wider sense, landmark reform\" that would cut reoffending.\n\n\"We want to maximise the chance people have when they get out of prison to be able to access those services and that's just harder on a Friday,\" he said.\n\n\"It's quite often a race against the clock, particularly if you've got a long way to travel, so this is just a sensible reform which will mean that you can bring that forward by just one or two days to give that individual more time to do those things.\"\n\nHe said he \"absolutely understood\" that some victims of crime might have concerns about offenders being released earlier than the end of their sentence.\n\n\"The protection of the public must always come first but this is also an aspect of protection of the public. When people do get out of prison, they must be able to have the chance to get on to that better path to be able to put in place those important things which will give that chance,\" Mr Hinds added.\n\nEnding Friday Releases formed part of the government's Prisons Strategy published in 2021. The Ministry of Justice committed to do it last year.\n\nThe Offenders (Day of Release from Detention) Private Members' Bill is expected to pass its final reading in the Commons on Friday before going to the Lords.", "Prosecutors say Mack helped recruit and groom women as sexual partners for the leader of the Nxivm group\n\nUS actor Allison Mack has been released from prison early after serving two years for her role in a sex-trafficking case tied to a cult-like group.\n\nThe 40-year-old pleaded guilty to racketeering and conspiracy charges in April 2019 related to her efforts to recruit women to the Nxivm sex cult.\n\nMack, best known for her role in the television series Smallville, was sentenced to three years in prison.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Prisons confirmed she had been released on Monday.\n\nNxivm, pronounced \"nexium\", started in 1998 as a self-help programme. It claims to have worked with more than 16,000 people including the son of a former Mexican president and Hollywood actresses such as Mack.\n\nProsecutors say Mack helped recruit and groom women as sexual partners for the group's leader, Keith Raniere. Though Raniere, 62, was at the top of this structure and the only man, Mack served as one of his top female deputies.\n\nFemale recruits were allegedly branded with his initials and expected to have sex with him in exchange for becoming a part of the group, which was based in Albany, New York.\n\nThe news of Mack's release was initially reported by the New York newspaper Albany Times Union.\n\nMack, who was arrested in 2018, was facing as much as 17 years in prison but saw her sentence reduced after providing evidence to help prosecutors pursue their case against Raniere.\n\nIn 2020, he was sentenced to 120 years in prison for multiple crimes, including forcing women to be his sexual \"slaves\".\n\nBefore her sentencing, Mack apologised to those she said had been harmed by her actions, calling her involvement with the group \"the biggest mistake and regret of my life\".\n\n\"I am sorry to those of you that I brought into Nxivm,\" she said. \"I am sorry I ever exposed you to the nefarious and emotionally abusive schemes of a twisted man.\"", "The police have been at the school since the incident\n\nA teacher is in hospital and a teenage boy in police custody following a suspected stabbing at Tewkesbury Academy.\n\nGloucestershire Police was called to the secondary school at 09:10 BST after reports a teenager had stabbed a male teacher.\n\nThe school was in lockdown, but pupils are now being allowed to leave.\n\nIts headteacher said all pupils were safe and well after the \"serious\" incident.\n\nDaniel, whose daughter attends Tewkesbury Academy, said it was a \"big scary affair\" when he found out something was happening.\n\n\"They [the pupils] were all scared but my daughter has been absolutely fantastic I'm very proud of her,\" he said.\n\nDaniel said his daughter video called him and he could see her teacher \"supporting the whole class\".\n\n\"The teacher sat right by the door.

Davidson denied the claims.\n\nJohn Davidson was told in 2019 that he was no longer under investigation because there was no evidence of corruption on his part in relation to the Stephen Lawrence case.\n\nThe NCA then investigated Mr Putnam and passed a file to the CPS to consider whether he should be charged with perjury or perverting the course of justice. The CPS has decided he will not be charged.\n\nThe IOPC investigation ended up focusing on the four senior officers from the first murder investigation, and their handling of the early part of the case.\n\nIn 2020, the IOPC passed a file of evidence to the CPS, which was asked to consider whether they may have committed the criminal offence of misconduct in public office.\n\nThe criminal offence of misconduct in public office is committed when the office holder acts - or fails to act - in a way that constitutes a breach of the duties of that office.\n\nLast week a BBC investigation identified a sixth suspect in the murder and exposed a series of police failings in relation to him.\n\nNew evidence about the murder of Stephen Lawrence, uncovered by BBC investigative reporter, Daniel De Simone.\n\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.", "Women workers are vital to UN humanitarian aid operations in Afghanistan\n\nThe United Nations head has strongly condemned a Taliban ban on Afghan women working for the organisation.\n\nSecretary General Antonio Guterres demanded Afghanistan's rulers immediately revoke the order, saying it was discriminatory and breached international human rights law.\n\nFemale staff were \"essential for UN operations\" in the country, he said.\n\nThe Taliban have increasingly restricted women's freedoms since seizing power in 2021.\n\nThere was no immediate word from their government on why the order had been issued.

It received its first screening at the Cannes Film Festival last month.\n\n\"It may be fuelled by the schmaltzy lyrics of a boy band, but this is ultimately a clear-eyed celebration of female friendship,\" said Screen Daily's Nikki Baughan.\n\n\"Aisling Bea brings a sharp wit (and essential levity) to the central character of Rachel; now a mid-40s no-nonsense children's ward nurse but, back in 1993, a 16-year-old school girl (played, in excellent casting, by Bea lookalike Lara McDonnell) and diehard fan of a boyband only ever referred to as 'The Boys'.\n\n\"Underneath the '90s vibes, colourful production design and occasionally cringey boyband lyrics, that's a deep-rooted sentiment that we can all take to heart.\"\n\nNot everybody was a fan, however.

Just like the music of Take That, I guess.\"\n\nBut, she added: \"Much like a classic Take That track, this is a film that cares much more for the display of emotion than it does its root cause - the second it dares get specific, it risks losing that wide-scale relatability.\"\n\nYahoo's Roxy Simons said: \"As far as musicals go, Greatest Days is an enjoyable caper thanks to its fun reinterpretations of Take That's songs, like the airport-based rendition of Shine that features stylish choreography and elaborate costumes\n\n\"Some songs feel perfectly suited for the scene they're used in, but there are others that feel as if they were added on just as a way to make sure fan favourites weren't missed off the list.

After winning the first set, Norrie was penalised for hindrance early in the second after being ruled to have put off Paire by shouting mid-point. Paire broke serve and won the next two sets, before 14th seed Norrie fought back to win 7-5 4-6 3-6 6-1 6-4. \"I've never been called for that. I think it's unacceptable,\" Norrie said. \"Both of us didn't know why he called it. I think Benoit thought it was for him, both of us were a bit confused. It was for sure a grunt. \"[The umpire] must have thought that I said something and I think to get involved there was absurd.\" Norrie put the incident behind him to hold off Paire in an entertaining first-round contest and maintain British interest in the Roland Garros singles. Norrie, 27, is the only Briton through to the second round with Jack Draper's injury problems continuing as he retired from his opening match with a shoulder issue. Dan Evans lost his opening match on Sunday and there are no British women in the main draw. Evans, who was beaten by Australia's Thanasi Kokkinakis, was also on the receiving end of an unusual decision by the officials when he was penalised for a harsh foot-fault. \"For me, I was a grunt, and for Evo, he was nowhere near foot faulting,\" said British men's number one Norrie, who plays another Frenchman, qualifier Lucas Pouille, in the second round on Wednesday. \"I got away with it and I was able to come through in five sets. But it was a big call and it changed the momentum of the match.\" When Draper retired while Norrie was battling to survive against 34-year-old Paire, it felt like it could be another chastening day for British tennis. Only Norrie, Draper and Evans made the main draws at the clay-court Grand Slam tournament, with another 10 losing in the qualifying events. Emma Raducanu is absent after having surgeries on wrist and ankle injuries, while Andy Murray pulled out because he wanted to focus on preparing his body for the upcoming grass-court season. No British players reached the second round on the Paris clay in 2020 and another first-round wipe-out looked on the cards with Norrie trailing. But the world number 13 maintained his composure in a partisan atmosphere and dug deep against the unpredictable Paire, who discussed retirement last year but was given a wildcard at Roland Garros after continuing. After edging a tight opening set, momentum swung away from Norrie following the harsh hindrance call from umpire Nico Helwerth in the third game of the second. Helwerth docked Norrie the point at 30-30 and it enabled the Frenchman to break for a 2-1 lead. With the vociferous backing of the jubilant home fans, Paire fed off their energy and was locked in during a third set where Norrie twice dropped serve early on. But Norrie is known as one of the most composed players on the ATP Tour, showing his mental resilience to reset and level the match with a one-sided fourth set. Despite losing serve in a poor start to the decider, Norrie upped his level again and his greater endurance - mental and physical - proved decisive in a strong finish. \"I think the crowd can be tough at times, but I keep reminding myself it's good to be playing, that I want to be out there competing and being in those tough moments when the crowd is against me,\" said Norrie. \"It makes it even better to come through those matches.\"\n\u2022 None Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone\n\u2022 None What's the story of the 'Indian Titanic'?

He said Britain had avoided recession this year \"so far\", and that he hoped to see faster growth and falling inflation in the months ahead.\n\nMeasures in his March Budget to help businesses recruit more staff and to increase investment, including an increase in childcare funding, should stimulate growth, he added.\n\nInvestor confidence in the UK was shaken last year during the short-lived government of prime minister Liz Truss, which saw Mr Kwarteng present an economic strategy that included major tax cuts without an explanation of how they would be funded.\n\nThe outlook for the UK, which relies heavily on financial services, could be clouded by current uncertainty in the banking sector, following the collapse of three US banks and UBS's emergency takeover of Credit Suisse.\n\nHowever, Mr Hunt said the UK had \"a very robust, resilient banking system\", which was now in a much better position than it was before the 2008 financial crisis.\n\n\"Am I confident in the resilience of our banking system, the second largest financial services centre in the world?' Yes, I am,\" he said.\n\nWhile the government is considering reforming some of the rules governing financial services, put in place after 2008, Mr Hunt said the plan was \"absolutely not to unlearn the lessons of the financial crisis\".\n\n\"We are looking at all of these things, but we're not going to do it in a way that rows back on any of the very important protections that we have in place,\" he said.\n\nBut he said the growth of the UK's tech and life sciences industries meant regulations needed to adapt.\n\n\"We have a lot of high growth companies in the UK, and they need to have banking services that suit their needs. And that's a difference from a decade ago,\" he said.", "King Charles and Camilla, the Queen Consort, will be crowned on Saturday\n\nThe King has recorded an announcement for railway stations across the UK in which he reminds us to \"mind the gap\".\n\nThe recording, made at Highgrove earlier this year by Transport for London (TfL), can also be heard on the London Underground until Monday.\n\n\"My wife and I wish you and your families a wonderful Coronation weekend,\" King Charles says.\n\n\"Wherever you're travelling we hope you have a safe and pleasant journey,\" Camilla, the Queen Consort adds.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

He appointed a special aide for LGBTQ issues and also said his party would consider a new bill.\n\nThe activists also said it was inaccurate for Mr Kishida to state that same-sex marriage was \"not unconstitutional\" in Japan, when local courts have ruled otherwise in at least two precedent-setting decisions.\n\nThe public attitude towards same-sex marriage has changed, especially among younger voters, said the Marriage for All Japan group. A recent poll shows two-thirds of voters support making same-sex marriage legal.\n\n\"I think this is one of the reason why the government is estranged from public opinion, as the most in the heart of the government are elderly men,\" said the group's chairperson Makiko Terahara.\n\nSome couples have challenged the ban before the courts, to varying results.\n\nIn November 2022, a Tokyo court upheld the ban on same-sex marriage but said the denial of legal protections to same-sex couples was discriminatory. Rights campaigners hailed the ruling as a win for raising the need to amend current laws.\n\nThe country is also under pressure from its G7 peers to recognise LGBTQ rights as the country prepares to host the bloc's next meeting in May.\n\nThere has been improvement in LGBTQ rights in Asia, but Taiwan remains the only territory that recognises same-sex marriage in the region.", "Parents claiming universal credit are to get more help with childcare costs under government's plans to encourage people back into work.\n\nThe chancellor will announce in his Budget on Wednesday that the government will start paying childcare costs up front for those on the benefit.\n\nCharities have warned the current scheme of paying and claiming a refund risks people getting into debt.\n\nJeremy Hunt says the Budget aims to put the country on a path to growth.\n\nAt the moment, people in England, Scotland and Wales who are eligible for the current support pay childcare costs upfront and then claim a refund.\n\nBut the support has also been frozen at \u00a3646-a-month per child for several years, meaning it has not kept up with the rising cost of care.\n\nMr Hunt is also expected to announced that the maximum amount people can claim for childcare on universal credit will be increased by several hundred pounds.

It has already said it will appeal the decision at the Supreme Court.\n\nThere has been concern about how children will be treated under the new migration bill, as well as accusations that existing UK regulations to prevent modern slavery would be undermined.\n\nAlthough the legal duty to deport migrants would not apply to under-18s the bill would give ministers new powers to deport them in certain circumstances.\n\nIt would also get rid of the current three day-limit on how long children and pregnant women can be detained, as well as the 24-hour maximum for children unaccompanied by an adult.\n\nThe government argues detention powers are necessary to ensure migrants destined for removal do not \"disappear into the community\" - and says no one would be held longer than is \"absolutely necessary\" to ensure they are deported.\n\nIt adds that there is also an over-arching legal duty to ensure the length of detention is \"reasonable\", adding that leaving the UK voluntarily will \"always be an option for all\".\n\nHowever in series of votes on Wednesday, a handful of Conservatives teamed up with opposition peers to preserve the detention limits.\n\nTory peer Baroness Mobarik, who proposed the amendments, said \"verbal assurances\" from ministers were not enough and \"necessary safeguards\" had to be added to the bill itself.\n\n\"The psychological harms of detention on young children is significant and likely to impact them for the rest of their lives,\" she added.\n\nImmigration Minister Lord Murray of Blidworth said safeguards were already in place for the detention of pregnant women, whilst those in the later stages of pregnancy would be released on immigration bail.\n\nChild detention was also a contentious issue when the bill was debated in the Commons, with the government avoiding a showdown with Tory rebels by promising to listen to concerns.\n\nTim Loughton, who spearheaded the rebellion, said at the time he wanted a maximum limit to remain.\n\nIn other votes on Monday, the Lords voted to ban deportations of LGBT migrants to 10 mainly African countries, including Rwanda, Nigeria and Kenya - with a specific ban on trans men and women being deported to Brazil.\n\nWhen the proposed bans were initially debated last week, Crossbench peer Lord Etherton, who suggested them, said the countries were \"hostile and unsafe\" for LGBT people.\n\nPeers also approved an amendment to retain the role of the courts in deciding what a \"reasonable\" length of detention is - striking down new powers in the bill that would allow ministers to decide.", "The Nikolay Zubov LNG tanker, docking in the UK in 2021\n\nShell is still trading Russian gas more than a year after pledging to withdraw from the Russian energy market.\n\nThe company was involved in nearly an eighth of Russia's shipborne gas exports in 2022, according to analysis from campaign group Global Witness.\n\nOleg Ustenko, an adviser to Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, accused Shell of accepting \"blood money\".\n\nShell said the trades were the result of \"long-term contractual commitments\" and do not violate laws or sanctions.\n\nAs recently as 9 May, a vast tanker capable of carrying more than 160,000 cubic metres of gas compressed into liquid form - liquefied natural gas or LNG - pulled out of the port of Sabetta, on the Yamal peninsula in Russia's far north.\n\nThat cargo was purchased by Shell before heading onwards to its ultimate destination, Hong Kong.\n\nIt is one of eight LNG cargoes that Shell has bought from Yamal this year, according to data from the Kpler database analysed by Global Witness.\n\nLast year Shell accounted for 12% of Russia's seaborne LNG trade, Global Witness calculates, and was among the top five traders of Russian-originated LNG that year.\n\nIn March 2022, in the weeks following the invasion of Ukraine, Shell apologised for buying a cargo of Russian oil, and said it intended to withdraw from Russian oil and gas.\n\nIt said that it would stop buying Russian oil, sell its service stations and other businesses in Russia, which it has done. It has also ended its joint ventures with the state energy giant Gazprom.\n\nAnd it said it would start a \"phased withdrawal from Russian petroleum products, pipeline gas and LNG\". But it warned that it would be a \"complex challenge\".\n\nShell said last year it would close all its service stations in Russia\n\nSince then, it has kept taking cargoes of LNG from two Russian ports, the one at Yamal and one at Sakhalin in the far east.\n\nShell used to be a minority investor in the Sakhalin gas project, but abandoned that claim in September last year after the Russian government transferred its shares to a local business - and since then has taken no gas from Sakhalin.\n\nBut it still honours the contract with the Russian LNG company Novatek, which obliges it to buy 900,000 tonnes a year from Yamal until the 2030s, according to the Reuters news agency.\n\nNovatek is Russia's second biggest gas company, and the taxes it pays are a significant contributor to the Russian government's budget.\n\nOleg Ustenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian president, said: \"It is quite simple: by continuing to trade in Russian gas Shell is putting money into Putin's pockets and helping to fund Russia's brutal aggression against the people of Ukraine.\n\n\"The vast sums that Shell and the whole oil industry have made in Russia should be used to help fund the reconstruction of Ukraine, rather than lining the pockets of their shareholders.\"\n\nA spokesman for Shell said: \"Shell has stopped buying Russian LNG on the spot market, but still has some long-term contractual commitments. This is in full compliance with sanctions, applicable laws and regulations of the countries in which we operate.\n\n\"There is a dilemma between putting pressure on the Russian government over its atrocities in Ukraine and ensuring stable, secure energy supplies. It is for governments to decide on the incredibly difficult trade-offs that must be made.\"\n\nShell is the world's largest trader of LNG, which is not subject to European sanctions, making billions of dollars in profits trading oil and gas last year.\n\nRussia massively reduced its deliveries of gas by pipeline last year, but it has increased the amount of gas it supplies by ship, including to Europe.\n\nThe UK has not imported any Russian gas for over a year, while EU politicians are trying to reduce the amount of Russian LNG the bloc imports. In March, the EU's Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson called on countries and firms to stop buying Russian gas, and not to sign new contracts.\n\n\"It's long overdue that the trading of Russian LNG is looked at with the same disgust as Russian oil trading.

Australian Defence Minister Richard Marles declined to comment on the case, saying it was a civil matter.\n\nMr Roberts-Smith is Australia's most famous living war veteran and served with the country's elite Special Air Service Regiment (SAS).\n\nHe received the country's highest military award - the Victoria Cross - in 2011 for having single-handedly overpowered Taliban machine-gunners who had been attacking his platoon.\n\nBut his public image was shattered in 2018 when The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and The Canberra Times started publishing articles about his misconduct between 2009 and 2012.\n\nThe soldier argued five of the killings reported by the newspapers had occurred legally during combat, and the sixth did not happen at all.\n\nHis defamation case - dubbed by some \"the trial of the century\" - lasted 110 days and was rumoured to have cost up to A$25m ($16.3m, \u00a313.2m).\n\nMore than 40 witnesses - including Afghan villagers, a government minister and a string of current and former SAS soldiers - gave extraordinary evidence about every facet of Mr Roberts-Smith's life.\n\nBut the case also exposed some of the secretive inner workings of Australia's elite special forces.\n\nThe trial heard from soldiers who said potential misconduct was rarely reported due to a \"code of silence\" within the regiment, and others defended their actions as necessary.\n\nMany giving evidence were there unwillingly, having been subpoenaed, and three refused to speak about some allegations fearing self-incrimination.\n\nMuch of the evidence against Mr Roberts-Smith relied on eyewitness accounts and recollections of discussions among soldiers. Justice Besanko had to weigh the reliability of witnesses against each other, with the media outlets contending theirs had no reason to lie.\n\nSpeaking outside the Federal Court in Sydney, the news outlets called the judgement a \"vindication\" for their reporting.\n\n\"It's a day of justice for the brave men of the SAS who stood up and told the truth about who Ben Roberts-Smith is: a war criminal, a bully and a liar,\" said investigative reporter Nick McKenzie, who wrote the stories alongside Chris Masters and David Wroe.\n\n\"[And] today is a day of some small justice for the Afghan victims of Ben Roberts-Smith.\"\n\nJournalist Nick McKenzie says their reporting had relied on the \"moral courage\" of other SAS soldiers\n\nThe Afghanistan Human Rights and Democracy Organisation also praised the role of investigative journalism in \"uncovering the truth and raising public awareness\" about what had taken place in the country.\n\nMedia magnate Kerry Stokes - who employs Mr Roberts-Smith at rival outlet Seven West Media - said the judgement did \"not accord with the man I know\".\n\n\"I know this will be particularly hard for Ben, who has always maintained his innocence,\" said Mr Stokes, who loaned the soldier money to fund his legal case. Mr Roberts-Smith had offered to hand in his Victoria Cross as collateral, local media reported.\n\nThe case comes three years after a landmark report found credible evidence that Australian forces had unlawfully killed 39 civilians and prisoners in Afghanistan from 2007 to 2013.\n\nAccusations of war crimes have also been levelled at soldiers from the UK and US in recent years.\n\nLocal media say dozens of Australian soldiers are being investigated for their roles in alleged war crimes. But so far charges have only been laid against one, Oliver Schulz.\n\nWar historian Peter Stanley told the BBC ahead of the judgement that Mr Roberts-Smith's case was \"a litmus test\" for allegations of Australian wrongdoing in Afghanistan.\n\n\"The Ben Roberts-Smith episode is just a precursor to the major series of war crimes investigations, allegations, prosecutions, and possibly convictions that we'll see over the next few years.\"", "Man City 2-1 Leeds: The taker is the taker, says Pep Guardiola Last updated on .From the section Man City\n\nManchester City are four points clear at the top and in control of the Premier League title race, but their manager Pep Guardiola still wasn't happy after his side's 2-1 win over Leeds. Goal machine Erling Haaland and match winner Ilkay Gundogan were the players who felt his wrath with Guardiola reminding them that \"this is a business\" after seeing a late penalty miss allow Sam Allardyce's side back into the game. Leading 2-0 with six minutes to go, City were cruising towards a 10th-successive victory and were handed a chance to wrap up the points when Phil Foden was fouled in the box. Step forward the deadliest finisher in the land - their prolific 51-goal striker and regular at spot-kicks, Haaland\u2026 or so you would think. Instead, Haaland handed the ball to Gundogan, who was on a hat-trick after scoring both of those earlier goals. Gundogan hit the post, and 58 seconds later Leeds went up the other end to make it 2-1 - ensuring a nervy finish to a game that City had completely controlled. The decision did not go down well with his manager, who made it clear to both players that he had wanted Haaland to take the penalty.\n\u2022 None Man City beat Leeds to go four points clear at top\n\u2022 None Have your say on City's 2-1 win\n\u2022 None Go straight to all the best Man City content \"First he [Guardiola] showed to Erling that he was quite mad about that and then also he had a go at me,\" Gundogan explained. \"It is what it is in the end. \"The moment Erling grabbed the ball, I was sure he was going to take it but he looked out for me. I checked with him a few times to make sure he was sure. He was certain to hand the ball to me. I was confident to score. I can't even remember if the keeper saved it or it was the post? \"We should have scored a third. This is sometimes how it is that they go on the counter and score. Things can change, momentum can shift. But we dealt quite well with it and deserved the three points.\" 'The taker is the taker' Guardiola had calmed down a little by the time he faced the media after the match but he was still adamant Haaland should have taken the penalty, given the situation his side were in. \"The game is not over,\" Guardiola said. \"It shows how nice and generous Erling is. If it is 4-0 with 10 minutes left, OK. \"But at 2-0? At 2-0, especially in England, it is never over. \"Erling is the best penalty taker right now so he has to take it. I want the player who is the taker, because they have more routine and a specialism. He has maybe taken 10 or 11 penalties and he had the feeling - Gundogan does not have that right now. \"I admire the fact Gundogan wanted the responsibility to take the penalty - that is the best value in a player - but normally the taker is the taker, and Erling had to take it because he is our specialist. \"Today Erling could have scored two or three goals. He played incredibly well, in his movement and how he fought for us. I like to praise him when he does not score. \"If Gundogan scores the penalty everyone is 'OK, hat-trick, well done'. But a taker is a taker. At 2-0, this is a business, not a situation where we cannot forget it.\" Another step towards another Premier League title City have now gone 20 games unbeaten in all competitions and this victory was another step towards their third successive Premier League title, part of their bid for a Treble that also includes the FA Cup and Champions League. They have played catch-up to Arsenal for most of the season and trailed the Gunners by eight points in January but, with both sides left with four games to play, they have opened up a significant lead for the first time - not that they are taking anything for granted. \"Probably the best warning about that is today,\" Gundogan added. \"But we have an experienced team and have had these kind of run-ins in recent years. We know what to do to keep the momentum going and win games. Nothing more but also nothing less.\"\n\u2022 None Our coverage of Manchester City is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment\n\u2022 None Everything City - go straight to all the best content", "A picture of Jean Moulin sat on Daniel Cordier's bookshelf at his home on the French Riviera\n\nFrench Resistance figure Daniel Cordier - who has died at the age of 100 - was one of the last remaining heroes decorated by Charles de Gaulle for their role in fighting the Nazi occupation.\n\nHis death on Friday leaves only one survivor among the 1,038 men and women who received the title \"Compagnons de la Lib\u00e9ration\" after World War Two.\n\nThe son of a wealthy merchant in south-western France, Cordier first became involved in politics in the 1930s as a teenage member of the royalist far-right.\n\nIn June 1940, after German forces crushed the French army and the government of Marshall Philippe P\u00e9tain sued for peace, Cordier's activism took a different turn.\n\n\"As my mother collapsed into my stepfather's arms, I raced upstairs and flung myself on my bed, and I sobbed. But then (\u2026) I suddenly drew myself up, and I said to myself, 'But no, this is ridiculous,\" Cordier recalled in a 2018 interview with the BBC. \"[P\u00e9tain] is just a stupid old fool! We have to do something.\"\n\nDaniel Cordier left to join the Free French in 1940 and returned in 1942\n\nThree days later he and a few friends boarded a ship bound for French Algeria, which was seen as shelter for patriots who refused to surrender. But the vessel was diverted to Britain, where Cordier joined de Gaulle's Free French.\n\nHe joined the movement's intelligence arm and was parachuted into central France in mid-1942. A high point in his life was his meeting with Jean Moulin, the man tasked by de Gaulle to co-ordinate Resistance groups.\n\nCordier had come to deliver a message. The two men hit it off and he became the commander's right-hand man, based in Lyon.\n\n\"I admired Jean Moulin from the moment I first saw him,\" Cordier told the BBC. \"He had an elegance and a kindness, and also a huge capacity for work. In his view, he was the Resistance. I hope in my own small way I was able to serve him as he wanted.\"\n\nTen months later Moulin was betrayed to the Gestapo and killed under torture. Cordier moved to Paris, where he continued to rally the resistance before escaping to London in 1944.\n\nAfter the war he became a painter and a successful art-dealer, promoting contemporary masters such as Braque and Dubuffet.\n\nHe later credited Jean MouIin for initiating him into modern art. The education, he said, had begun as a kind of code. Moulin, he once said, decided to give him loud lectures on painters so as not to arouse suspicion when out and about in the danger zone that was occupied France.\n\nCordier took part in World War II commemoration ceremonies until his late 90s\n\nFocused on his passion for art, Cordier did not speak publicly about his wartime past for decades. But he broke his silence in the 1970s, when a fellow Resistance hero portrayed Moulin - a hallowed figure in France - as a shambolic self-promoter and a Soviet agent.\n\nOutraged, Cordier decided to clear his former boss's name. Delving into his Resistance past, he sifted through Resistance archives and interviewed survivors.\n\n\"I knew it was not true. But to prove it, I had to go back to the records,\" he told the BBC in 2018. The work culminated in the publication of influential biographies of Moulin in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nControversy among historians continued over the nature of Moulin's links with the Communists - who after all were a key component of the Resistance Jean Moulin worked to unify. But Cordier's historical work helped refute many of the wilder allegations.\n\nHis effort to expose the truth did not end there. In a 2009 autobiography Cordier came out as gay, saying it would have been \"utterly unthinkable\" when he was young.", "Loyal bank customers are being offered \"measly\" rates of interest on their savings, a committee of MPs has said.\n\nThe trend, which particularly affects older and more vulnerable customers, are the result of banks chasing higher profit margins, MPs on the Treasury Committee claimed.\n\nRates on instant access savings products are much lower than the Bank of England base rate.\n\nBanks said they had to balance the needs of savers and borrowers.\n\nIn the past few months MPs on the committee have been challenging major banking bosses on the returns offered to their savings customers.\n\nIn February, the chief executives of the four biggest banks in the UK - Lloyds, NatWest, HSBC and Barclays - were given a grilling in Parliament.\n\nDescribed as the highest-paid panel which had sat before the committee for some time - collectively earning more than \u00a310m a year - the quartet of bank bosses argued that the debate incorrectly centred on the interest rate offered on easy access savings accounts.\n\nThey argued that regular saver deals offered market-leading rates of interest, and that instant access products were often a \"gateway\" to higher interest deals.\n\nThe hearing was followed by a string of letters to those banks, and the next tier of providers. Their responses have just been published.\n\nAmong them was a letter from Debbie Crosbie, chief executive of the Nationwide, who said that the building society needed to be prudent, it tried to help customers to get a better deal, and balance was required.\n\nShe said that included weighing up \"the interests of savers with our mortgage borrowers, particularly with cost-of-living pressures\".\n\nThe committee appears to be unimpressed with the providers' defence. It pointed out that the the big four High Street banks offered instant access savings rates of between 0.7% and 1.35%, compared with a Bank of England base rate of 4.5%.\n\n\"It is clearer than ever that the nation's biggest banks need to up their game and encourage saving,\" said Harriett Baldwin, who chairs the committee.\n\n\"While other products are available to those who shop around, the measly easy access rates on offer lead us to conclude that loyal customers are being squeezed to bolster bank profit margins.\n\n\"We remain concerned that the loyalty penalty is especially prominent for elderly and vulnerable customers who may still rely on High Street bank branches.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, UK Finance - the trade body for the banking sector - published data that showed total household savings shrunk year-on-year for the first time in at least 15 years.\n\nThe value of deposits in instant access accounts fell by 4% to \u00a3867bn in March compared with \u00a3905bn a year earlier, as people dipped into savings pots to cover larger bills and food shopping.", "Nurses in Northern Ireland may have no alternative but to take further strike action if there has been no pay offer by autumn, the NI director of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has said.\n\nRita Devlin said nurses had been treated \"like second-class citizens\".\n\nHer comments come after the Department of Health said there was no money for an uplift in a submission to an independent pay review body.\n\nMs Devlin said members were becoming increasingly frustrated over pay.\n\nOn Thursday, more than one million public sector workers in England and Wales, including teachers, police and doctors were told they would be offered pay rises of about 6%..\n\nUnder a deal set out earlier this year, NHS workers will receive a 5% pay rise. Ambulance workers, nurses, physiotherapists and porters will also get a one-off sum of at least \u00a31,655.\n\nStormont's Department of Health said it did not have the funding to cover such a rise in Northern Ireland.\n\nRita Devlin from the RCN said without a pay offer problems with staff retention and recuitment will worsen\n\nMs Devlin told BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme that nurses were growing increasingly frustrated over pay.\n\nIf by autumn \"there is no offer on the table, no change in the political situation, if nothing changes, I do not believe we have an alternative (to strike action)\", she continued.\n\nShe added that nurses can make \"a significantly increased amount of money\" by working outside Northern Ireland, in other parts of the UK or the Republic of Ireland.\n\nA spokesperson for the Northern Ireland Office said the UK government \"has no authority to negotiate pay in Northern Ireland\".\n\nThe pay review body said the Department of Health's submission highlighted pay in Northern Ireland may fall behind other parts of the UK.\n\nIt added this risks \"significantly deteriorating the position of the NHS workforce in Northern Ireland compared to the rest of the UK\".\n\n\"The Department of Health told us there is currently no funding for a pay award and they would have to bid for funding from the Department of Finance,\" the body continued.\n\n\"They said they needed any pay award to be fully funded by HM Treasury.\"\n\nThe body added it was concerned with what the department had said about affordability, telling it \"there was no capacity to afford a pay uplift for 2023-24 without implementing corresponding cuts to expenditure on services or additional funding being made available\".\n\nNurses took part in industrial action earlier this year\n\nOn Thursday, a number of trade unions representing other parts of the public sector warned of industrial action in Northern Ireland if there was no progress on pay, with most decisions devolved to Stormont ministers.\n\nThere is currently no functioning executive or assembly at Stormont because of the Democratic Unionist Party's (DUP) protest against post-Brexit trading rules.\n\nIt has instead been left to the Northern Ireland secretary to set a budget.\n\nHowever, departmental budgets are being squeezed, partially as a result of an overspend last year.\n\nOn Thursday, Liam Kelly from the Police Federation of Northern Ireland said officers wanted clarity on whether a similar pay deal to England and Wales would apply in Northern Ireland.\n\n\"At this stage our officers are entitled to know if they are getting 7% or if, for the first time, there will be a break with pay parity,\" he said.\n\nFunding a 7% pay rise would be a financial headache for the Police Service of Northern Ireland in the current landscape.\n\nIt has earmarked \u00a318m in its budget for a wage increase for about 6,500 officers.\n\nBut that only equates to a 5% uplift, at a time when it is looking into a \u00a340m black hole in its finances.\n\nPreviously, Northern Ireland has followed the rest of the UK in terms of officer pay awards.\n\nThere are now concerns among officers parity could be broken.\n\nPolice officers cannot go on strike, so they do not have the same leverage as other parts of the public sector.\n\nImplementing any parallel 7% rise for prison officers would be equally challenging.\n\nThe head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service has warned that Stormont departments had \"reached the limit\" of what they can do to manage budget pressures this year and another overspend is looming.\n\nJayne Brady warned the government there remains an unfunded pay pressure of \u00a3571m, and a further \u00a3437m of pressures requiring decisions.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Finance said pay awards \"need to be viewed in the context of the available budget\".\n\n\"Relevant Northern Ireland departments will consider the recommendations made by the pay review bodies and the local implications,\" they added.\n\nA separate pay review body said consultants, dentists and GPs in Northern Ireland should get a 6% pay rise in line with the rest of the UK.\n\nImplementing that in Northern Ireland would cost about \u00a340m and it does not appear there is the money available.\n\nMeanwhile, Justin McCamphill, from the teaching union NASUWT, said teachers \"will vote with their feet\" if their pay falls behind other regions.\n\n\"If we don't invest in our young people, we won't have an economy for the future,\" he said.\n\n\"So the government needs to look at the decisions it's been making.\"\n\nThere has been stalemate over a pay deal for teachers in Northern Ireland for over two years.\n\nThe last pay rise teachers got was for the 2020/21 school year.\n\nThere have been some big hikes in the cost of living since then, which have hot teachers like other workers.\n\nTeachers have had to look on as their counterparts elsewhere in the UK have received rises - though not without strikes and strife in some cases.\n\nThe upshot is a teacher's salary in Northern Ireland is often thousands of pounds behind those in England, Scotland and Wales.\n\nFor instance, a new teacher in Northern Ireland gets just over \u00a324,000 a year while in England that is now set to rise to around \u00a330,000.\n\nPay deals are negotiated and agreed locally in Northern Ireland between the unions and management bodies like the Department of Education and Education Authority.\n\nBut with an education budget under severe pressure, and no Stormont, chances of a deal anytime soon are slim.", "An emotional Lewis Capaldi told the Dundee crowd he was living his childhood dream\n\nLewis Capaldi, Jonas Brothers, The 1975, Anne-Marie and Zara Larsson are among the artists who took to the stage in front of tens of thousands of music fans at Radio 1's Big Weekend.\n\nThe three-day festival opened at Dundee's Camperdown Park on Friday -

This, though, is something completely different - a technical tour de force, full of boundary-pushing experimentation, as well as a heartfelt ode to absolute beauty.\"\n\nLady with a Fan is among the very few portraits by Klimt, a leading figure of the Vienna Secession art movement, to be owned privately. It was last sold in 1994, when it fetched $11.6m (\u00a39m).\n\nThe Austrian Symbolist painter is best-known for his work on gold-leaf-encrusted canvases such as The Kiss, 1907-8, and Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I, 1907.", "Marmite-maker Unilever and supermarket Sainsbury's have rejected suggestions that they are not protecting customers from rising prices.\n\nIt comes after the Office for National Statistics (ONS) told the BBC that falls in global food prices were not yet being reflected in supermarkets.\n\nUnilever said it was not \"profiteering in any form\" from rising prices.\n\nSainsbury's said it had spent millions on lowering prices and was \"determined to battle inflation\".\n\nThe cost of living has surged recently, with food prices almost a fifth higher in March than a year earlier - the biggest such rise since 1977.\n\nHowever, wholesale food prices have started to fall with the World Bank saying it expected them to drop 8% by the end of this year.\n\nSupermarkets say such falls take time to reach supermarket shelves. But in March the Unite union accused some supermarkets of \"fuelling inflation by excessive profiteering\".\n\nIn January, Tesco chairman John Allan suggested suppliers may be at fault, telling the BBC it was \"entirely possible\" that they were using high inflation as an excuse to raise prices unnecessarily.\n\nBut on Thursday, Unilever boss Alan Jope dismissed such suggestions to reporters, saying the company was only passing on three-quarters of the higher costs it was facing.\n\n\"We are very conscious that the consumer is hurting and that's why we are not passing through the full price increases and are asking shareholders to bear some of the burden,\" Mr Jope said.\n\nIt came as the consumer goods giant, which also makes Ben & Jerry's ice cream, reported a 10.5% rise in sales in the first three months of the year.\n\nThe better-than-expected figure was driven by price hikes, with the company lifting prices by 10.7% over the period.\n\nSeparately, the boss of Sainsbury's said the chain would pass on any falls in the price of goods as soon as it could and was \"absolutely determined to battle inflation for our customers\".\n\nHowever, Simon Roberts said widespread price falls were not likely to come soon as energy and labour costs continued to rise.\n\nIt came as the UK's second largest grocery chain reported a better-than-expected 5% fall in underlying profits to \u00a3690m and a near-6% rise in sales in the year to March.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has driven up food prices around the world, but the UK has faced other problems on top of this - from Brexit red tape to labour shortages.\n\nThis year in particular, bad weather abroad led to shortages of some vegetables - a situation made worse by UK farmers producing less due to surging energy costs.\n\nUK farmers have also argued that supermarkets are not paying a fair price for their produce - something the supermarkets deny.\n\nLast week, the British Retail Consortium, which represents grocers, said there was a three to nine-month lag to see price falls reflected in shops.\n\n\"As food production costs peaked in October 2022, we expect consumer food prices to start coming down over the next few months,\" it said.", "President Erdogan's powers have increased dramatically since he first led Turkey in 2003\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been in power for more than 20 years and he is favourite to win five more, having narrowly missed out on a first-round victory.\n\nTurkey is a Nato member state of 85 million people, so it matters who is president both to the West and to Turkey's other partners including Russia.\n\nMr Erdogan's opponent in a second-round run-off on 28 May is Kemal Kilicdaroglu, who was backed by six opposition parties and won almost 45% of the vote - some 2.5 million votes less than his rival.\n\nTurkey has become increasingly authoritarian under President Erdogan and this was the opposition's biggest chance yet to defeat him, with Turks struggling with soaring inflation and reeling from twin earthquakes that have left more than 50,000 people dead.\n\nWhoever wins the vote on 28 May will win the presidency.\n\nHis AK Party has been in power since November 2002, and he has ruled Turkey since 2003.\n\nAlthough Turkey's 64 million voters are deeply polarised, the 69-year-old leader has an in-built advantage over his rival.\n\nMr Erdogan's allies control most mainstream media, to the extent that state TV gave the president 32 hours and 42 minutes of air time and his challenger just 32 minutes, at the height of the campaign in April.\n\nMonitors from the international observer group OSCE said there was an unlevel playing field and biased coverage in Turkey's vote, even if voters had genuine political alternatives.\n\nInitially Mr Erdogan was prime minister, but he then became president in 2014, running the country from a vast palace in Ankara. He responded to a failed 2016 coup by dramatically increasing his powers and cracking down on dissent.\n\nLeading Kurdish politicians have been jailed and other opposition figures threatened with a political ban.\n\nBut this election was the opposition's biggest hope of unseating the president yet.\n\nIncreasing numbers of Turks have blamed him for rampant inflation of 44%, and academics say the real rate is far higher than that.\n\nHe and his ruling AK Party were widely criticised for their response to the double earthquakes in February that left millions of Turks homeless in 11 provinces.\n\nAnd yet most of the cities which are considered Erdogan strongholds still gave him 60% of the vote.\n\nHis party is rooted in political Islam, but he has forged an alliance with the ultra-nationalist MHP.\n\nKemal Kilicdaroglu, 74, is an unlikely choice of candidate to unseat the president.\n\nHe is seen as a mild-mannered and bookish opponent and presided over a string of election defeats at the helm of the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP).\n\nHe polled well in the first round, taking Mr Erdogan to his first run-off, but not as well as the opinion polls had indicated he would.\n\nMr Kilicdaroglu secured the backing of six opposition parties, including the nationalist Good party and four smaller groups, which include two former Erdogan allies one of whom co-founded the AK Party.\n\nKemal Kilicdaroglu has agreed that the leaders of his alliance will all share the role of vice president\n\nHe also has the support of Turkey's second-biggest opposition party, the pro-Kurdish HDP, whose co-leader described the elections as \"the most crucial in Turkey's history\".\n\nHis biggest hope of snatching victory from a president buoyant after his first-round lead lies in increasing the support of both nationalist and Kurdish voters. A difficult feat when Turkey's nationalists want the next president to take a tougher line on Kurdish militants.\n\nIn the lead-up to the second round, he made a clear pitch to nationalist voters, banging his fists on the table and vowing to send home 3.5 million Syrian refugees. This was already his policy, but now he has decided to make a big point of it.\n\nKemal Kilicdaroglu's selection was not universally popular as the mayors of Istanbul and Ankara were potentially stronger candidates. Both are party colleagues who took control of Turkey's two biggest cities in 2019 for the CHP for the first time since 1994.\n\nHe is also a member of Turkey's Alevi minority, and when the opposition candidate drew attention to his roots Mr Erdogan accused him of seeking to exploit it.\n\nHis Nation Alliance, also known as the Table of Six, are united in their desire to return Turkey from the presidential system created under Mr Erdogan to one led by parliament.\n\nThe leaders of the other five members of the alliance have agreed to take on the roles of vice-president. But even if they were to win the presidency, the Erdogan alliance won a majority in parliament on 14 May and would make reforms very difficult.\n\nTurnout in the first round was already very high at almost 89% among voters in Turkey.\n\nIf Mr Kilicdaroglu is to make up the 2.5 million votes between him and President Erdogan, he will need to win over voters who backed ultranationalist candidate Sinan Ogan who came third in the first round with 2.8 million votes.\n\nThat task was made even harder when Mr Ogan endorsed the president.\n\nHis demand is for a tougher stance on tackling Kurdish militants and returning Syrian refugees.\n\nMr Kilicdaroglu had already adopted a more strident tone on Syrians since the first round, promising to \"send away\" all refugees as soon as he came to power.\n\nReacting to Mr Ogan's decision to back his rival, he said the vote was now a referendum: \"We are coming to save this country from terrorism and refugees.\"\n\nPresident Erdogan said he had made no deals with Mr Ogan: 450,000 refugees had already returned home and the plan was to send back another million, he said.\n\nThe ruling AK Party of Recep Tayyip Erdogan has forged an alliance with the nationalist MHP and together they have secured a majority of 322 seats in the 600-seat parliament, down on five years ago.\n\nParties tend to form alliances because they need a minimum of 7% support to enter parliament.\n\nThe six-party opposition wants to change that but its Nation Alliance only managed 212 seats.\n\nThe pro-Kurdish party ran under the banner of the Green Left to avoid a potential election ban, and came third with 61 seats.\n\nUnder the Erdogan reforms, it is now the president who chooses the government, so there is no prime minister.\n\nUnder Turkey's revamped constitution allowing only two terms as president, Mr Erdogan would have to stand down in 2028 if he won the 28 May run-off. There are currently no plans for a successor.\n\nHe has already served two terms but Turkey's YSK election board ruled that his first term should be seen as starting not in 2014 but in 2018, when the new presidential system began with elections for parliament and president on the same day.\n\nOpposition politicians had earlier asked the YSK to block his candidacy.\n\nUnder an Erdogan presidency, Turkey can expect increased control of state institutions and the media and a greater crackdown on dissent. Inflation is likely to remain high because of his preference for low interest rates.\n\nInternationally, he could continue to resist Sweden's bid to join Nato and will paint himself as a mediator between Ukraine and Russia.\n\nMr Kilicdaroglu and his allies want to remove the president's right to veto legislation, cutting the post's ties to political parties and making it electable every seven years.\n\nHe wants to bring inflation down to 10% and send 3.5 million Syrian refugees home. President Erdogan has promised to speed up the voluntary repatriation of a million Syrians.\n\nMr Kilicdaroglu also wants kickstart Turkey's decades-long bid to join the European Union and restore \"mutual trust\" with the US, after years of fractious relations during the Erdogan years.", "The club said no current directors or senior managers were involved in price fixing\n\nLeicester City faces a fine of up to \u00a3880,000 for colluding to fix the price of replica football kits, the UK's competition regulator has said.\n\nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said the club and retailer JD Sports had admitted to anti-competitive behaviour, including \"price fixing conduct\".\n\nIt said both broke competition law between 2018 and 2021 with an illegal deal on clothing sales.\n\nThe club has accepted the CMA findings.\n\nThe 2015-16 Premier League champions, and their parent companies, have subsequently agreed to pay a fine up to the maximum penalty of \u00a3880,000, the CMA said.\n\nJD Sports will avoid a fine after reporting the illegal activity.\n\nJD Sports said it signed a leniency agreement with the CMA last month\n\nThe provisional findings of a CMA investigation revealed that, in August 2018, JD Sports said it would stop selling Leicester City-branded clothing online for the 2018-19 season, and in January 2019, JD Sports agreed it would \"not undercut\" the club in terms of online sales for the following season by making Leicester City items exempt from free delivery.\n\nIt said JD Sports continued the agreement to sell all Leicester City clothing with the delivery charge until at least January 2021.\n\nMichael Grenfell, the CMA's executive director of enforcement, said: \"Strong and unimpeded competition between retailers is essential to consumers' ability to shop around for the best deals.\n\n\"Football fans are well-known for their loyalty towards their teams.\n\n\"In this case we have provisionally found that Leicester City FC and JD Sports colluded to share out markets and fix prices with the result that fans may have ended up paying more than they would otherwise have done.\n\n\"Both parties have now admitted their involvement, allowing us to bring the investigation to a swift conclusion.\n\n\"The fine that Leicester City FC and its parent companies have agreed to pay sends a clear message to them and other businesses that anti-competitive collusion will not be tolerated.\"\n\nThe club, which was relegated to the Championship last season, stressed none of its current directors or senior management were involved in the arrangements.\n\n\"These arrangements related to a limited number of bulk orders by JD Sports, which were accepted by the club's retail sales team over the relevant period,\" it said in a statement.\n\n\"There was no intention on the part of the club to unlawfully restrict the resale of the goods supplied and no material financial advantage to be gained from doing so, given the limited amount of kit supplied to JD Sports.\n\n\"However, the club accepts the CMA's findings and has taken steps to strengthen its training and compliance measures to ensure the club's retail operations fully comply with competition law.\"\n\nJD Sports also said no current or former directors or senior management of JD were involved in the offending conduct and that it signed a leniency agreement with the CMA last month.\n\nThe company added: \"JD has taken a number of steps to strengthen its competition compliance programme and the board reaffirms its commitment to making the necessary resource available, internal and external, to ensure that this is embedded into its daily operations.\"\n\nThe announcement come almost a year after JD Sports, its rival Elite Sports and Rangers Football Club were handed fines over price fixing on replica kits.\n\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, or on Instagram.

The costs of the hub are shared between the participating banks.\n\nAnother 48 banking hubs have been agreed for areas across the UK, but they can take 12 months to find a premises and get up and running.\n\nBanks have pointed to the large reduction in branch use - a trend accelerated by the Covid pandemic - and the popularity of managing money via smartphones, as good reason for diluting their branch network.\n\nBut Age UK said its survey suggested those who were most likely to feel uncomfortable using online banking were aged over 85, female, on a low income, or more disadvantaged than their counterparts.\n\nAmong those who were uncomfortable, the key concerns about online banking were fraud and scams, a lack of trust in online banking services, and a lack of computer skills.\n\nThe survey size becomes relatively small when broken down, but Age UK said that 34% of those with an annual income of less than \u00a317,500 mainly banked face-to-face, compared to 15% of those with an income of \u00a330,000 to \u00a349,999 a year.\n\nSeparate figures show that, since the start of 2020, more branches have closed in poorer parts of the UK than in better-off areas.\n\nIn its report called \"You can't bank on it anymore\", Age UK said it was vital that physical banking spaces were protected.

The power begins with closing the Ukrainian skies with missile defence and air defence systems,\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\nMoscow has consistently denied that it seeks out civilian targets.

Russia would pay, he said, for \"every innocent person killed\" and \"the suffering of our people\".\n\nElsewhere, in the southern region of Kherson, the head of President Zelensky's office, Andriy Yermak, said four people were killed in what local officials called merciless Russian shelling.\n\nThe Kherson military administration said one of those killed was a 60-year-old utilities worker whose team had come under fire. Several others were injured in the blast.\n\nAnd a drone attack has been reported in Russia's border region of Bryansk - with Governor Alexander Bogomaz saying a police station was hit.\n\nOn Saturday, Russian officials said three Ukrainian drones were downed in Moscow - the latest in a series of drone assaults on the Russian capital.\n\nMoscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin blamed Ukraine for the attack, in which two office blocks were damaged, although there were no casualties.\n\nPresident Zelensky warned that war was coming back to Russia, and that attacks on Russian territory were an \"inevitable, natural and absolutely fair process\" of the war between the two countries.\n\nEmergency services helped residents in the aftermath of the missile strike", "A former US Marine who placed a homeless man in a fatal chokehold on a New York City subway train has pleaded not guilty to criminal charges.\n\nDaniel Penny, 24, was indicted in court on Wednesday on counts of second-degree manslaughter and negligent homicide.\n\nWitnesses said Jordan Neely, 30, was shouting at other subway passengers and asking for money when Mr Penny pinned him down for several minutes on 1 May.\n\nVideo of the confrontation sparked protests and counter-demonstrations.\n\nMr Penny faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted of the manslaughter charge. He was arrested on 12 May and released on $100,000 (\u00a380,000) in bail.\n\nHe has said he was acting in self-defence in the incident on a northbound F train subway car in Manhattan.\n\nWitnesses said Mr Neely was shouting about how he was hungry and willing to return to jail or die. There is no indication he physically attacked anyone.\n\nThe incident was filmed by bystanders, and a video captured by a freelance journalist on the train shows Mr Penny holding Mr Neely around the neck for two minutes and 55 seconds.\n\nHe continued to restrain Mr Neely, including after he stopped moving, say prosecutors.\n\nEmergency responders tried to resuscitate him, and he was taken to hospital, where he was pronounced dead.\n\nThe city medical examiner said his death resulted from compression of the neck and ruled it a homicide.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said he hopes the Neely family is \"on the path towards healing as they continue to mourn this tragic loss\".\n\nMr Penny did not address reporters as he entered the Manhattan court for Wednesday's brief hearing.\n\nEarlier this month, Mr Penny addressed the incident on social media and said he did not intend to kill Mr Neely.\n\n\"I was scared for myself but I looked around there were women and children, he was yelling in their faces saying these threats. I just couldn't sit still,\" he said.\n\nSupporters of Daniel Penny rallied in New York City last month\n\nOutside court, attorneys for Mr Penny expressed confidence he will ultimately be found not guilty.\n\n\"There is not a living, breathing soul in Manhattan that has not experienced a variation of what not only Mr Penny but other individuals experienced on that subway car,\" lawyer Thomas Keniff said.\n\nThe defendant was ordered to return to court on 25 October for a pre-trial hearing.\n\nA self-defence argument was the most logical way for Mr Penny to proceed, attorneys told the BBC.\n\nThe case is \"dependent on whether or not there was an imminent harm posed to himself or others, and whether or not his conduct was excessive\", said Dmitriy Shakhnevich, a criminal defence attorney and professor at John Jay Law School.\n\n\"That's really it,\" he said. \"There's nothing else in this case.\"\n\nThat standard would be quite high, said Lance Fletcher, a former prosecutor who now works as a New York defence attorney.\n\n\"They have to say, he killed this guy and it wasn't justified, and no reasonable person would think it was justified,\" Mr Fletcher said. \"And that's going to be tough.\"\n\nPerception \"has a huge impact on the case\", said Mr Fletcher, \"since this case is all about justification\".\n\nMr Neely was a Michael Jackson impersonator who frequently performed in Times Square.\n\nHe had 42 arrests on charges such as evading fares, theft and assaults on three women, according to US media reports.\n\nMr Neely began experiencing mental health issues after his mother's murder by her boyfriend in 2007, his aunt, Carolyn Neely, told the New York Post last month.\n\nNew York Mayor Eric Adams has said Mr Neely's previous offences highlight the need to improve the city's mental health system.\n\nThe case has become politically charged with conservatives - including Florida Governor and presidential hopeful Ron DeSantis - praising Mr Penny as a hero.\n\nHis detractors, such as US civil rights leader Reverend Al Sharpton, have characterised Mr Penny as a vigilante in the mould of Bernard Goetz, a white man who shot and injured four black men on a New York subway in 1984.\n\nMr Penny's supporters have raised nearly $3m (\u00a32.37m) for his legal defence.\n\nBut Neely family attorney Donte Mills said on Wednesday: \"For everyone who thought donating $3 million would somehow make this go away or buy his pass: It's not going to happen.

Now that judgement can be made.\n\nThe Catalan, who won the Champions League with Barcelona in 2009 and 2011, will now be an iconic figure at City as well as Barcelona.\n\u2022 None 'Hysterical and hated at times' - but Guardiola is the greatest\n\nIt is a simple fact that many outside the Abu Dhabi-owned club will always view their triumph through the prism of the charges of 115 financial breaches brought against them by the Premier League, charges they fiercely deny.\n\nFor City's owners, with Sheikh Mansour attending only his second game since taking control in 2008, this was the night they have planned for and the one when they finally claimed that holy grail.\n\nThis was an evening when only the result mattered to City, not the manner in which their greatest victory was achieved.\n\nThis was not a win secured with the dazzling style and creation that is usually their hallmark. In fact for long periods it was a scrappy, sloppy performance in the face of a well-drilled Inter side who were right in this Champions League Final until the whistle went.\n\nNone of that will matter now. All that will be recalled forever about this game by City's fans was the moment when Rodri arrived on the end of build-up play from Manuel Akanji and Bernardo Silva to send that precise right-foot finish away from the reach of Inter's outstanding keeper Andre Onana.\n\nAnd of course the triumphant Champions League trophy lift.\n\nCity lived dangerously in the closing minutes and, when it was all over, Guardiola, so agitated in his technical area, was relatively calm as he sought out opposite number Simone Inzaghi for consoling words.\n\nJohn Stones was once again outstanding for City while keeper Ederson made key contributions when required.\n\nThe celebrations at the final whistle reflected a magnificent season as City finally got their hands on the Champions League trophy and prepared to parade it around the streets of Manchester along with the Premier League and FA Cup on Monday.\n\u2022 None Attempt saved.

The press is the essential element in a community of being able to attain that.\"\n\nAsked why anyone should become a reporter today, he said to find \"the best obtainable version of the truth\".\n\nRobert Woodward said political hate had become part of the United States\n\nThe Chat GPT programme, which uses AI, has become widely used in the past year and Rajan read them an excerpt that the tool had produced about the two veteran US journalists.\n\nIt briefly summarised who they were and said their work \"had inspired a new generation of journalists and established a new standard for investigative reporting\".\n\nBernstein said he wasn't enamoured by the extract and described it as \"an amalgam of things that have been written about us\".\n\nHe recognised part of it from a brochure used for the conference they had attended. Despite it being the early stages of artificial intelligence, he said: \"AI is a huge force we're going to have to grapple with in this world.\"\n\nCarl Bernstein described AI as a huge force to be grappled with.\n\nDiscussing the limitations of AI, Woodward said: \"I can call the Pentagon and say, 'I'd like to talk to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the top military man', and he's either going to talk or maybe not. AI can't do that.\"\n\nAmol Rajan interviews Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, the two journalists at the heart of the Watergate scandal, about Nixon, Trump and America today.\n\nTheir Watergate story began with the two reporters carrying out traditional journalism, knocking on doors following a burglary, and ended by exposing the wrongdoing of President Nixon.\n\nThe pair are revered in US journalism for their award-winning reporting, and their book about Watergate was adapted for the big screen in All the President's Men.\n\nThe movie came out in 1976 and starred Robert Redford as Woodward and Dustin Hoffman as Bernstein.\n\nDustin Hoffman and Robert Redford in All the President's Men\n\nBernstein drew a parallel between the dramatic events surrounding the resignation of President Nixon and those around the end of President Trump's time in office.\n\n\"We never thought we would see it with another president. It happened even more so and even more dangerously with Trump,\" he said.\n\nThis year, Rupert Murdoch's Fox News paid out nearly $800m (\u00a3643m) over its reporting of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nMurdoch owns many media outlets, including the Times, the Sun and the Wall Street Journal, as well as Fox News.\n\nBernstein and Woodward worked at the Washington Post\n\nAsked whether Rupert Murdoch has been a force for good, Bernstein said: \"Instead of being remembered for his imagination in terms of what he did with the movie business, with changing television shows like South Park, all of this has been overwhelmed by promoting, encouraging and accepting a culture of untruth that has been the hallmark of his journalism\".\n\n\"I think in terms of his legacy, it is going to be evil because he has taken untruth and made it his imprimatur.\"\n\nWoodward has written many books including ones on Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, Donald Trump and the CIA.

Under trade union laws, life-and-limb cover must be provided.\n\nThe junior doctors' approach contrasts with recent strikes by nurses and ambulance workers, which saw unions agree to exempt certain emergency services.\n\nBut doctors say they are striking for patient safety as much as about pay, saying that current pay levels are affecting recruitment and leading to many doctors leaving the profession.\n\nDr Emma Runswick, deputy chairwoman of the BMA, said they are hoping this round of industrial action will be the last - but \"we will continue\" if the government does not move.\n\nShe told BBC One's Breakfast. \"This is not a situation where we are fixed in our position. We are looking for negotiations and Steve Barclay isn't even willing to talk to us.\n\n\"He hasn't put any offer at all on the table. If we want to start a negotiation there has to be two sides in the discussion.\"\n\nMr Barclay said he had hoped to begin formal pay negotiations with the BMA last month but said its demand for a 35% pay rise was unfair and would result in some junior doctors \"receiving a pay rise of over \u00a320,000\".\n\nAre you a junior doctor with a view on the strike? Are you a patient affected? Share your experiences by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.\n\nProf Sir Stephen Powis, NHS England's national medical director, said it would be \"the most disruptive industrial action in NHS history\".\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme as the walkout began on Tuesday morning, Mr Powis warned it \"will take weeks\" to recover from the strikes as \"services will undoubtedly be affected\".\n\nDuring last month's three-day walkout by junior doctors, more than 175,000 treatments and appointments were cancelled.\n\nBut Prof Sir Stephen added the expectation is to see \"considerably more\" cancellations this time around due to the strike lasting four days. Estimates from other senior NHS figures have suggested between 250,000 and 350,000 appointments and operations could be cancelled.\n\nMental health services and some GP surgeries are also expected to be impacted, while the NHS said it will prioritise keeping critical care, maternity, neonatal care, and trauma operations running.\n\nDr Vivek Trivedi, co-chairman of the BMA junior doctors' committee, advised people to still ring 999 if they have a life-threatening illness as \"the service is working as normal and we have prioritised emergencies\".\n\nDr Paul Turnbull, 61, from Hampshire, who is an occupational health doctor, needs a prosthetic femur bone implanted in his leg.\n\nHis operation has been cancelled twice - once in December, because he developed deep vein thrombosis, and the second time because of the first junior doctors' strike. The operation is now due to take place on 18 April, after the four-day strike.\n\nHe has limited mobility and is unable to work.\n\n\"As a doctor, I don't believe doctors should strike. I think our first responsibility is to our patients and I think using patients as pawns in a dispute with the government is not something we should be doing.\"\n\nNeuroscientist Dr Camilla Hill, 42, from Nottingham, has also been affected. She has had two knee operations cancelled because of the junior doctors' strikes - one this week and one back in March. She now has a third date scheduled for 25 April.\n\nShe has been unable to do some of her favourite hobbies, which include hiking and sailing, in part because of the pain in her knees.\n\n\"I feel really frustrated. It's messed me about, it's messed about my employer, it's messed about my husband - and it's messed about his employer as well. It's not just the patient whose operation is cancelled that's impacted, it's everybody around them.\"\n\nJunior doctors say their demanding for a 35% increase in pay is to compensate for 15 years of below-inflation wage increases.\n\nBut the government has said the pay demand is unrealistic, pointing to the deal other health unions - representing nurses and other workers - have recommended to their members, which includes a 5% pay rise and one-off payment of at least \u00a31,655.\n\nMore than 40% of the medical workforce are classed as junior doctors, with two-thirds of them members of the BMA.\n\nThe term junior doctors covers those who are fresh out of medical school through to others who have a decade of experience behind them.\n\nRabiat is in her third year of junior training, working in a hospital in the south east of England.\n\nShe is planning on striking this week, saying it is as much about safety as it is pay.\n\n\"It's quite a common thing that junior doctors are left alone with wards of patients to look after, with their seniors having gone down to A&E or an acute assessment area, for example.\n\n\"We feel really left out and unsupported. Not because our seniors don't want to support us, but because we are all stretched to our limits.\n\n\"I really hope that the strikes will make the government realise that this is really having a big impact on junior doctors - and the whole of the NHS - and more actually needs to be done.\"\n\nAre you a junior doctor with a view on the strike?

partner were targeted by private investigators working for the publisher of the Daily Mirror.\n\nIn his evidence on Tuesday, he accused the newspaper's former editor Piers Morgan of \"two-faced conduct\".\n\nTony Blair's former spin doctor was giving evidence in London on Tuesday as part of a trial brought against Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN).\n\nThe High Court is hearing \"representative\" cases brought by the Duke of Sussex and others and concerns stories dating back, in some cases, more than 20 years.\n\nThe claimants allege information was gathered via unlawful methods including phone hacking, securing information through deception, and journalists using private investigators to trick others into handing over confidential information about the targets.\n\nThe claimants believe their private and confidential information was obtained by journalists from the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and The People newspapers.\n\nPrior to 1994, Mr Campbell had been a journalist for the Daily Mirror and Sunday Mirror.\n\nIn a written witness statement, he said he had been shown three documents by the claimants' legal team, dating from when he was chief press secretary in Downing Street, a role he held between 1997 and 2000.\n\nTwo of the documents were from invoices by private investigation firm Southern Investigations, both addressed to then-Daily Mirror investigations editor Gary Jones, and the third was a confidential hand-written note which contained numbers for financial accounts held by Mr Campbell and his partner Fiona Millar, he said.\n\nIn his statement he said the \"fact that MGN unlawfully obtained such private and personal financial information\" about himself and his partner was \"extremely troubling\".\n\n\"The fact that they did not publish the information they obtained in no way minimises this view,\" he said.\n\nMr Campbell said he believed the inquiries into his affairs related to a story involving the finances of Labour grandee Peter Mandelson, published on Christmas Eve in 1998.\n\nHe said he had also seen documents which indicated that a \"blagger\" sent Lord Mandelson's private banking and mortgage details to Southern Investigations, who sent them on to Gary Jones, now editor of the Daily Express, on December 23 of that year.\n\n\"As a result, I believe that the Daily Mirror decided, at the time of the Mandelson story, to fish into my bank and mortgage affairs in the hope that they too would reveal something they considered newsworthy,\" he said.\n\nIn his witness statement, he said he believed Mr Morgan was aware of such conduct.\n\n\"I have read the section of Piers Morgan's memoirs, The Insider, dealing with late December 1998 and I can now see that Mr Morgan does not set out truthfully how he obtained the information on Mr Mandelson,\" he said.\n\nHe said that Mr Morgan purported \"to be a real ally of the prime minister and the Labour government, while all the time he and his senior team were using illegal means to find stories designed to destabilise that government\".\n\nMr Campbell said this \"compounds the anger I feel about this\", as did \"the fact that this conduct has been emphatically denied, by Mr Morgan and his colleagues, for so long\".\n\n\"Fiona and I are shocked and, frankly, appalled at this intrusion into our privacy by the Daily Mirror,\" the statement said.\n\n\"I find it very hard to believe that any editor, especially one as hands-on as Mr Morgan, would not have known and demanded to know where the big stories were coming from.\n\n\"Nor do I believe that people in senior positions in government with access to highly sensitive information and with obvious security concerns would have been targeted in this way without the editor knowing and

It was apparently taken as police arrived on the scene.\n\nA letter from the Scorpions Group was allegedly left with the men which apologised to the people of Matamoros, to the US victims and their families, and to a Mexican woman killed last week when the gang fired on a white minivan the Americans were travelling in.\n\nThe Associated Press says it has obtained a copy of the letter from a law enforcement official in the state of Tamaulipas.\n\n\"We have decided to turn over those who were directly involved and responsible for the events\", the letter reads, saying the five had \"acted under their own decision-making and lack of discipline\". The letter also accuses the men of breaking the cartel's rules over \"protecting the lives of the innocent\".\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Video shows the moment four Americans were kidnapped in Mexico\n\nMeanwhile, a health clinic in Matamoros where the cartel members allegedly took the injured US citizens for treatment has been cordoned off by police. Reports suggest the four Americans were taken there by the gang but the two with the worst injuries - Shaeed Woodard and Zindell Brown - died soon after.\n\nReuters news agency reported that Mexican officials had given the bodies of the two dead men to US officials in Matamoros on Thursday afternoon, and their remains were repatriated.\n\nThe latest developments come as some doubts have been cast in Mexico on the initial version of events. The group were said to have travelled to Matamoros for one of them, Latavia McGee, to undergo a cosmetic medical procedure at a clinic in the city. Her three friends were said to have accompanied her to the appointment.\n\nThe international border crossing between Texas and Matamoros\n\nHowever, the Reuters news agency has reported that three of the four Americans had convictions for mainly minor drug-related offences - but one was charged with manufacturing banned narcotics with the intent to distribute.\n\nReuters says it's seen an internal law enforcement document which shows the Mexican authorities are investigating the possibility the four Americans were kidnapped having been mistaken for rival cartel members encroaching on their turf.\n\nThe wooden shack where the Americans were discovered\n\nThe question over the Americans' backstory comes as the political temperature over the incident in Matamoros continues to rise. In the United States, several Republican politicians, among them the Senator for South Carolina, Lindsey Graham, have called for the use of US military force against Mexico's drug cartels.\n\nSpecifically, he's proposing a plan to designate Mexican drug cartels as \"Foreign Terrorist Organisations\" in order to, as he put it, \"unleash the fury and might of the United States against (them)\".\n\nOne suspected kidnapper was arrested earlier this week\n\nThat rhetoric prompted a furious response in Mexico from President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador who said \"Mexico was not a protectorate or a colony of the United States\". His sentiments were echoed by the Foreign Minister, Marcelo Ebrard, who called Senator Graham's proposal for military intervention \"unacceptable\".\n\nAmid the tense relations, the US Homeland Security Advisor, Liz Sherwood-Randall, is in Mexico for a meeting with President Lopez Obrador to discuss the worsening crisis over fentanyl and synthetic opioids in the US.", "The Coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla at Westminster Abbey was attended by royals from around the world, international leaders, famous faces, faith leaders, charity representatives and local heroes.\n\nHere's a look at who was there - and who got the front row seats.\n\nMembers of the Royal Family were front and centre at the ceremony, many in full regalia, like the Prince and Princess of Wales.

Eve Smith, 21, Darcy Ross, 21 and Rafel Jeanne, 24, died after the crash\n\nSocial Justice Minister Jane Hutt said both Gwent and South Wales Police had referred themselves to the Independent Office for Police Conduct, who would \"look at exactly what happened\".\n\n\"We just have to recognise that extraordinary public grief that was expressed in the vigil for victims that took place at the site of the crash last night,\" she said.\n\nDescribing the crash as a \"devastating tragedy\", she said: \"My thoughts remain with the families and the friends of the young people involved in the crash on the A48.\n\n\"This will be an extraordinarily difficult time for all affected by this terrible incident.\"\n\nSenedd Presiding Officer Elin Jones said she remembered watching Rafel Jeanne in the same team as her nephew in primary school.\n\nHe was \"such a young fast talent on the rugby field\", she said.\n\n\"And on behalf of us all in the centre of our sympathies are with the friends and families of Eve, Darcy and Rafel, and our hopes are with Sophie and Shane for a full recovery,\" she said.", "Parents should face child benefit cuts if they fail to ensure their children turn up at school, cabinet minster Michael Gove has suggested.\n\nSpeaking at a think tank, the levelling up secretary said the idea could help restore an \"ethic of responsibility\".\n\nMr Gove - who first proposed the idea in 2014 - said it would help tackle anti-social behaviour.\n\nDowning Street said parents could already be fined for children missing school.\n\nThe idea of cutting benefits for parents of truants was first suggested by Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair in 2002, but it was dropped in favour of the current fines system.\n\nMichael Gove resurrected the idea when he was education secretary under Prime Minister David Cameron but it was never implemented.\n\nSpeaking at an event held by Onward, a centre-right think tank, Mr Gove said: \"Particularly after Covid, we need to get back to an absolute rigorous focus on school attendance.\n\n\"One idea that we considered in the coalition years - but which the Liberal Democrats blocked - I think needs to be reconsidered again, is linking parental responsibility for attendance and good behaviour to the state.\n\n\"One of the ideas that we floated in the coalition years - which as I say, the Liberal Democrats rejected - was the idea that if children were persistently absent, that child benefit should be stopped.\n\n\"I think what we do need to do is think radically about restoring an ethic of responsibility,\" he added.\n\nCurrently, parents whose children miss school in England can be issued with \u00a360 fines, which rise to \u00a3120 if they are not paid within 21 days. They are normally issued by local councils.\n\nThey can also be ordered to attend parenting classes, or have a supervisor appointed to help them get their child into the classroom.\n\nThe use of fines dropped off during the pandemic due to an increase in home learning, but BBC research last year suggested they had started to pick up again.\n\nLast year, the government set out plans to introduce new national guidelines in England on the issuing of fines, and make schools draw up their own attendance policies.\n\nThe measures were later incorporated into the Schools Bill - however this legislation was dropped in December after it hit hurdles in Parliament.\n\nThe NAHT, a union representing school leaders, condemned Mr Gove's suggestion, adding that it was \"likely to be counter-productive\".\n\n\"It is very hard to see how consigning children to poverty and starvation will improve their school attendance,\" general secretary Paul Whiteman added.\n\n\"Persistent absence can only be successfully tackled by offering help, not punishment.\"\n\nLiberal Democrat education spokesperson Munira Wilson said: \"If Michael Gove thinks that the solution to encourage children back to school is to impoverish them, then he is living in a different century\".\n\nThe prime minister's official spokesperson said there were no plans to change the existing system.", "Gary Prado Salm\u00f3n in 2007 - he wrote a book about the capture of Che Guevara\n\nThe Bolivian general who captured the Cuban revolutionary Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara and became a national hero has died aged 84.\n\nIn 1967 Gary Prado Salm\u00f3n led a military operation in Bolivia, backed by US secret service agents, that defeated a communist insurrection organised by Che Guevara.\n\nAt the time Bolivia had a right-wing military government.\n\nAn army officer executed Argentina-born Guevara a day after his arrest.\n\nThe Cold War between the US and Soviet Union was at its height and Washington was extremely concerned about communist influence in Latin America, including Che Guevara's activities.\n\nHe had left Cuba after the triumph of the 1959 revolution there, to lead guerrilla movements in other countries. He was a key ally of Cuban communist leader Fidel Castro and became a hero for communists worldwide.\n\nGen Prado's son described his father as \"an extraordinary person\", who left \"a legacy of love, integrity and courage\".\n\nChe Guevara pictured in Cuba in 1965 - he was industry minister at the time\n\nThe Bolivian officer who shot and killed Che Guevara was Mario Ter\u00e1n, who died last year.\n\nAfter ambushing Guevara's guerrilla group Gen Prado was made a national hero for having defended the Bolivian military regime.\n\nHe had led US-trained Bolivian Rangers in a remote jungle region where Che Guevara's group, originally numbering about 120, had declined to just 22.\n\nSince 1981 Gen Prado had been a wheelchair user, after a bullet fired accidentally hit him in the spine. He wrote a book about his 1967 triumph, called How I Captured Che.\n\nAccording to his son, \"for him capturing Che was not the most important thing he did in his life - rather, it was to contribute to making the armed forces a democratic institution that would respect the constitution and laws\".\n\nChe Guevara was executed in the Bolivian village of La Higuera, 830km (516 miles) south of La Paz, and his body was buried in a secret location. In 1997 his remains were discovered, exhumed and returned to Cuba, where he was reburied.", "Janet Yellen is the second senior Washington official to visit Beijing in as many months\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has called on China to work with Washington to fight the \"existential threat\" of climate change.\n\nSpeaking on Saturday, she said the two countries - the largest greenhouse gas emitters - had a joint responsibility to lead the way on climate action.\n\nShe called on China to support the US-led Green Climate Fund.\n\nMs Yellen is on a four-day trip to Beijing in an attempt to boost relations between the two countries.\n\nChinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, who was among those to meet with Ms Yellen, said he regretted \"unexpected incidents\", such as the row over a spy balloon, had hurt ties with the United States.\n\nThere has been no formal co-operation between China and the US on climate change since the administration of former President Donald Trump.\n\nAnd China briefly suspended climate talks entirely with the US last year after senior Democrat Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, which is self-ruled but Beijing sees as a breakaway province it will eventually unite with.\n\nBut in a sign that co-operation could soon resume, Ms Yellen called on China to work together with the US to fight climate change and mitigate the effects on poorer countries.\n\nDuring the roundtable meeting in Beijing with finance experts, she called on China to support US-led institutions like the Green Climate Fund, which was set up to help developing nations adapt to climate change and lessen its effects.\n\n\"As the world's two largest emitters of greenhouse gases and the largest investors in renewable energy, we have both a joint responsibility - and ability - to lead the way,\" she said.\n\nChina is now the world's biggest investor in solar energy, and biggest producer of solar panels and wind turbines but saw its carbon dioxide emissions rise 4% in the first quarter of this year compared to 2022.\n\nThe US, meanwhile, has invested billions of dollars in recent years into initiatives aimed at tackling climate change but also saw its emissions rise slightly last year, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\nWhile Ms Yellen wants China to join the US in funding the worldwide transition to renewables, the sticking point is China's insistence that it is still a developing country.\n\nBeijing says it is up to the US and Europe to pay for the energy transition, because they have historically created most of the emissions.\n\nMs Yellen is the second senior Washington official to visit Beijing in the last two months. Her presence there is aimed at easing tensions and restoring ties between the world's two superpowers.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Beijing last month, making him the highest-ranking Washington official to visit the Chinese capital in almost half a decade. He met President Xi Jinping and foreign minister Qin Gang.\n\nAt the end of his trip, Mr Blinken said that while there were still major issues between the two countries, he hoped they would have \"better communications, better engagement going forward.\"\n\nHowever, the next day President Joe Biden referred to Mr Xi as a \"dictator\" - triggering outrage from Beijing.\n\nIn another sign the trade dispute between the two countries is far from being resolved, China this week announced it was tightening controls over exports of two materials crucial to producing computer chips.\n\nFrom next month, special licences will be needed to export gallium and germanium from China, which is the world's biggest producer of the metals.", "Drivers pay a toll charge to use the Dartford Crossing between Kent and Essex\n\nMotorists crossing the Thames between Kent and Essex are still struggling to pay for their journeys following the introduction of a new system.\n\nCustomers say they cannot access the website or have been placed in an online queue to pay their charge.\n\nThose who used the crossing over the weekend had been told to pay by Tuesday or face a fine.\n\nHowever, National Highways said it would be extending its payment deadline but did not specify until when.\n\nA spokesperson said: \"The Dart Charge contact centre and website is currently experiencing exceptionally high demand after the system improvements made over the weekend.\"\n\n\"To help ease pressure we have placed people in a queue, which will mean a short delay in accessing the website and our call centre advisors,\" they added.\n\nThe statement thanked motorists for their patience as they waited to pay.\n\nOne driver told the BBC he crossed the bridge for the first time on Saturday.\n\nHe said he had waited in an online queue for three hours on Sunday evening and was still unable to process the payment.\n\nA post on Dart Charge's Twitter page said its website was \"currently at capacity\" and therefore people were struggling to access it, as well as call centre advisors.\n\nThe post has so far received more than 200 responses from customers, with many calling for the charges to be waived.\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

They include regular meetings with civil servants and advisers.\n\n\"It appears some within government have decided to make unfounded suggestions both to the police and to the Privileges Committee - many will conclude that this has all the hallmarks of yet another politically motivated stitch-up.\"\n\nThe spokesman said Mr Johnson's lawyers had written to the Cabinet Office, as well as the Commons Privileges Committee, \"explaining that the events were lawful and were not breaches of any Covid regulations\".\n\nThe seven-member committee of MPs has been investigating whether Mr Johnson misled Parliament over Covid rule-breaking events in government buildings.\n\nIn a statement, the committee said it had received additional evidence from the government last week and asked Mr Johnson for a response, both of which it would now take into account during its probe.\n\nIf the committee concludes Mr Johnson deliberately misled MPs over the events, he could potentially face a suspension from Parliament, which in turn could lead to a by-election in his Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency.\n\nMr Johnson's spokesman also said it was \"bizarre and unacceptable\" that \"no contact was made with Mr Johnson before these incorrect allegations were made both to the police and to the Privileges Committee\". The Cabinet Office has denied the suggestion Mr Johnson was not given prior notice.\n\nThe Cabinet Office said the material it had passed to police came from the \"normal\" process of reviewing documents to be submitted to the public inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic.\n\n\"In-line with obligations in the Civil Service Code, this material has been passed to the relevant authorities and it is now a matter for them.\"\n\nThe BBC has been told the matter was not considered by ministers or the cabinet secretary, who heads the civil service.\n\nThe public inquiry, which is separate to the privileges committee probe, will begin hearings next month.\n\nBoth Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak were fined for attending a birthday party in Downing Street\n\nResponding to the announcement, Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said: \"These new allegations are for the police to examine but the government must explain who else knew at the time and why this has only now come to light.\"\n\nLiberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper, said Mr Johnson \"should finally do one decent thing and consider his position as an MP\".\n\nLindsay Jackson, spokesperson for Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, said Mr Johnson was \"totally unfit for any form of public service, never mind being the prime minister\".\n\nBut, speaking on his GB News programme, Conservative MP and former minister Jacob Rees-Mogg defended Mr Johnson, saying: \"The latest stories are just another example of how those who don't like Boris, mainly because of Brexit, are always looking for something to have a go at him on.\"\n\nMr Johnson resigned as prime minister last July, in part due to public anger over revelations he broke Covid lockdown rules.\n\nIn April 2021 he received a fine from the police for breaking lockdown rules after attending a gathering on his birthday in June 2020.\n\nAnd, in May 2022, a report by then-senior civil servant Sue Gray set out a series of social events held by staff in Downing Street which broke the rules.", "Supermarket executives have denied making too much money from soaring prices, telling MPs the industry is the \"most competitive we have ever been\".\n\nBosses from Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons were grilled over high food and fuel prices.\n\nThe supermarkets rejected claims of making excess profits and said they were shielding customers from the full impact of rising costs.\n\nThe competition watchdog is looking into the level of food and fuel prices.\n\nIt is examining whether not enough competition has meant customers are overpaying.\n\nSupermarket executives were quizzed by MPs on the Business and Trade Committee on Tuesday on why food prices were still rising, despite some wholesale costs falling.\n\nFood prices rose by 14.6% in the year to June, according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC), which represents supermarkets. That was down from 15.4% in the year to May, but it does not mean prices are falling, just that they are rising at a slower pace.\n\nHigher grocery prices remain a key reason why the overall rate of inflation in the UK remains stubbornly high.\n\nChairman Darren Jones said that all four supermarkets, with the exception of Morrisons, had made increased profits compared to before the Covid pandemic.\n\nMr Jones said he had heard of Asda employees recently \"having to go to the food bank to collect donations of food they had stacked in their own supermarket because they cannot make ends meet\".\n\nBut the supermarkets said they all paid the National Living Wage or above and argued they were doing all they could to protect customers from higher costs resulting from increased energy, labour and commodity prices.\n\nJane Hunt, a Conservative MP, asked executives if they were \"in fact a cartel\" and were colluding to set prices.\n\nIn response, Kris Comerford, chief commercial officer for Asda, said UK retail was \"the most competitive market\", a sentiment echoed by executives from Sainsbury's and Tesco.\n\nAll four supermarket bosses said they did not support a price cap on essential foods, an idea which had been considered by the government, but was never formally proposed.\n\nPoliticians, trades unionists and the governor of the Bank of England have all questioned why supermarket prices have not fallen as rapidly as the wholesale cost of ingredients such as wheat.\n\nSome have suggested that retailers might be failing to pass on savings and are banking the profit instead.\n\nSupermarkets have previously said they have cut prices when possible and added that falls in wholesale costs take time, typically three to nine months, to filter through to the shelves.\n\nHelen Dickinson, head of the BRC, said the trade body expected food inflation to drop \"to single digits later this year\".\n\nMost of the big chains have recently introduced price cuts to staples, with Sainsbury's on Monday the latest to announce it was investing \u00a315m to reduce the cost of basics such as rice, pasta and chicken.\n\nHowever, some items such as milk and eggs remain relatively expensive compared to pre-Covid prices.\n\nJamie Keeble, co-founder of sausage and burger maker Heck which supplies most of the major supermarkets, told the BBC's Today programme that the price of pork was expected to remain high for the next 18 months.\n\nHe said the only way supermarkets could lower their prices was by asking suppliers to cut costs, but he added: \"We're certainly not in the position to start giving cost decreases on our products.\n\n\"At the end of the day, [the supermarkets] are going to have to take a cut in their margins if they really want to lower the prices on the shelf, that's the only way to do it.\"\n\nSeparately, all four supermarket executives backed calls for more transparency on fuel prices, after MPs highlighted that prices for petrol and diesel were lower in Northern Ireland as a result of data being shared widely with drivers.\n\nA study by academics at the London School of Economics last month found nearly a third of food price inflation since 2019 was due to Brexit.\n\nHow is the price of food changing your diet?

the country's highest-profile transgender cyclist - was stopped from competing in her first elite women's race by the UCI, cycling's world federation, despite meeting the rules at the time.\n\nBridges reacted to the announcement with a statement on social media, calling the change a \"violent act\" by a \"failed organisation\" that was \"controlling\" the conversation on transgender inclusion.\n\nShe added that the racing scene was \"dying under its watch\" and that British Cycling was engaged in \"culture wars\".\n\nBritish Cycling's policy had allowed transgender women to take part in elite female events if they met testosterone-based regulations.\n\nBut with the governing body at the heart of the debate over balancing inclusion with fairness, its regulations were suspended amid mounting controversy about Bridges and a review was launched.\n\n\"Research studies indicate that even with the suppression of testosterone, transgender women who transition post-puberty retain a performance advantage,\" said British Cycling.\n\n\"Our aim in creating our policies has always been to advance and promote equality, diversity and inclusion, while at the same time prioritising fairness of competition.\n\n\"We recognise the impact the suspension of our policy has had on trans and non-binary people, and we are sorry for the uncertainty and upset that many have felt during this period.\"\n\nTransgender women will be able to participate in non-competitive recreational and community cycling without restriction.\n\nThe new policies will be implemented by the end of the year.\n\n'You have no right to tell me when I am done' - Bridges response\n\nIn her statement, Bridges was critical of the state of British Cycling and its treatment of transgender riders.\n\n\"Cycling is still one of the whitest, straightest sports out there and you couldn't care less,\" she said. \"I agree there needs to be a nuanced policy discussion and continue to conduct research. This hasn't happened.\n\n\"Research isn't being viewed critically, or any discussion about the relevance of the data to specific sports.\n\n\"I've given my body up to science for the last two years, and this data will be out soon.\n\n\"There is actual, relevant data coming soon and discussions need to be had.\"\n\nBridges claimed discussion of the debate is \"inherently political\" and \"framed by the media who are driven through engagement by hate\", saying she was \"terrified to exist\".\n\nShe claimed British Cycling was \"furthering a genocide against us. Bans from sport is how it starts\".\n\nShe added: \"I know a lot of people will think I'm being dramatic, or overplaying how scary things are at the moment. I don't even know if I want to race my bike any more\u2026 but you have no right on telling me when I am done.\"\n\nBritish Cycling is not commenting on Bridges' statement.\n\nHaving been a highly promising competitor in junior men's events, Bridges came out as transgender in 2020, starting hormone therapy as part of her gender dysphoria treatment.\n\nShe then became eligible to compete in elite women's events under British Cycling's transgender regulations, which required riders to have had testosterone levels below five nanomoles per litre for a 12-month period prior to competition.\n\nBut days before the 2022 National Omnium Championships, the UCI said Bridges' participation could only be allowed once her eligibility to race in international competitions was confirmed, dashing her hopes of competing for Wales in the Commonwealth Games.\n\nA group of elite female cyclists called on the UCI to \"rescind\" its rules around transgender participation, claiming female athletes in the UK were \"willing to boycott\" events over their \"concerns about fairness in their sport\".\n\nBridges said she felt \"harassed and demonised\" and had \"little clarity\" on her eligibility. She added that she \"does not have any advantage\" over her competitors, and could prove it with data.\n\nWhile British Cycling suspended its rules, the UCI then toughened its regulations, doubling the qualification period to two years and lowering the required testosterone threshold for transgender women riders to 2.5nmol/L.\n\nBut this month, after Austin Killips became the first transgender woman to win a UCI women's stage race at the Tour of the Gila, the world governing body re-opened consultation on the issue, saying it \"hears the voices of female athletes and their concerns about an equal playing field for competitors\".\n\n\"We acknowledge the paucity of research at this time, but can only look at what's available to use,\" said British Cycling chief executive Jon Dutton.\n\n\"I am confident that we have developed policies that both safeguard the fairness of cycle-sport competition, whilst ensuring all riders have opportunities to participate.\n\n\"We have always been very clear that this is a challenge far greater than one sport. We remain committed to listening to our communities, to monitor changes in the scientific and policy landscape, to ensure that sport is inclusive for all.\"\n\nFiona McAnena from Fair Play For Women told BBC Radio 4's World at One she was \"concerned about all the women and girls who need to know that sport will be fair so I think an open category is a great solution because it doesn't negate anyone's identity\u2026[and] the female category can be protected.\"\n\n\"We're finally reverting to fairness. We are going to see it across all sports.\"\n\nHowever Joanna Harper - a sports scientist who studies the effects of transition on transgender athletes, and who is transgender herself - said she was \"disappointed but not surprised\".\n\n\"I don't think it's necessary\" she told BBC Radio 5Live. \"Trans women have been competing in cycling for many years\u2026and although they have achieved some success in the sport, they are under-represented and are not anywhere near taking over the sport.\"\n\nIn March, UK Athletics also banned transgender women from competing in the female category in its competitions and events. There have been similar moves in swimming,triathlon and both codes of rugby.\n\nA number of studies have suggested transgender women retain cardiovascular and strength advantages compared to female athletes, even after taking testosterone-suppressing hormones.\n\nCritics of transgender athletes' participation in some women's sports argue that gives them a disproportionate advantage over their peers and limits opportunities for their rivals.\n\nHowever, others argue there is not enough detailed research in the area, that the science is not clear, and that with very few elite transgender athletes, sport should be more inclusive, with open categories criticised for being discriminatory.\n\nBritish Cycling said its women-only community programme \"will continue to remain open and inclusive for transgender women and non-binary people\" who can \"continue to participate in a broad range of British Cycling activities in line with their gender identities\".\n\u2022 None Will they carve a brighter future down under?\n\u2022 None Michael Mosley chews over the surprising benefits of these nutrient powerhouses", "CCTV footage played in court showed Couzens, using his position as a police officer, to stop Sarah Everard\n\nWayne Couzens, the ex-police officer who used his position to trick his way to raping and murdering Sarah Everard in March 2021, is returning to court this week to be sentenced for indecent exposure.\n\nCouzens will never leave prison. That means the real questions now are whether these earlier offences should have identified him as a violent threat to women - and what his case tells us about so-called flashers going on to commit far more serious sexual offences.\n\nBefore Couzens killed Ms Everard, detectives have identified six incidents of indecent exposure linked to him - he has pleaded guilty to three, while the others will lie on his file.\n\nThe first of those was in June 2015, when Kent Police received a report of a man in a car in Dover exposing himself. A witness gave officers the car registration plate, which was registered to Couzens, then at the Civil Nuclear Constabulary. Yet officers took no further action.\n\nThen, in November 2020, four months before the murder, a woman was cycling along a country lane in Deal, Kent, when a totally naked man stepped out of a wooded bank and looked straight at her.\n\nShe cycled away, but spotted a number plate of a parked car. That car belonged to Couzens, by now a Met Police officer. A later analysis of mobile phone data placed his phone in the area at the right time. This is one of the three incidents Couzens has admitted.\n\nThe two other admissions are part of four virtually identical allegations of escalating concern in the weeks before the murder.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nCouzens repeatedly visited a drive-thru restaurant and exposed himself to staff while sitting in his car, on one occasion while he was paying for food. The last incident was less than a week before Ms Everard disappeared.\n\nSo are these incidents relevant to Ms Everard's murder? Jennifer Grant is a criminologist who studies sex offenders, having worked with them previously as a probation officer.\n\nThe Portsmouth University academic says \"it's a really complicated question to answer\", but there is evidence that some men graduate from indecent exposure to serious sexual assaults and rape.\n\n\"There's long been a suggestion that indecent exposure is connected to anti-social behaviour more generally rather than a sexual motivation. And not everyone who exposes themselves is doing it to get sexual pleasure.\"\n\nThere is a group of offenders who are potentially violent because the way they expose themselves involves anger, and an apparent desire to frighten and control women they approach, she says.\n\nThe most reliable evidence comes from a 2014 United States study analysing data going back 30 years. It concluded that between 5% and 10% of men who commit \"exhibitionist\" crimes escalate to sexual assaults.\n\nWithout getting into the distressing details of what Couzens did, each of his exposure incidents places him in the category of a man seeking sexual control over his target.\n\n\"Couzens is clearly a worst-case,\" says Mrs Grant. \"But there is a clear pattern of him gaining confidence and an increasing frequency of incidents. I saw this with some offenders who [over time] would be getting closer to victim.\"\n\nSo despite Kent Police having actionable evidence in 2015 - a car registration plate - why was the suspect not pursued?\n\nPart of the answer to that lies in the disciplinary proceedings now taking place.\n\nBut the fact is that indecent exposure has historically, and culturally, been regarded by many as a \"nuisance\" offence rather than a sexual crime.\n\nThat's because its origins lie in the Vagrancy Act of 1824 - a law aimed at cleaning squalid Georgian streets of \"rogues and vagabonds\".\n\nThat law was in place until 2003 - when Parliament finally recognised indecent exposure as a sexual offence. The maximum penalty went from three months in jail to two years.\n\nPolice in England and Wales recorded more than 13,000 incidents of indecent exposure and voyeurism in the year to September 2022. But the trend of annual charging and conviction rates is very low.\n\nThe most recent data shows that just 457 men were convicted and sentenced for exposure in 2021. Just 120 of them were jailed - and most were locked up for less than six months.\n\n\"If we don't charge and convict, then we cannot manage the sex offender,\" says Mrs Grant. \"If we convict, then they're on the sex offenders register. There is an offender manager assigned to them in prison and a probation officer providing oversight on the outside.\n\n\"Even if they receive a minor sentence, the experience can have a huge deterrent effect.\"\n\nWhich brings us back to the question of what any of this would have meant for Wayne Couzens.\n\nA Kent police sergeant is facing a misconduct hearing over the handling of the 2015 indecent exposure allegation - while a former Metropolitan Police officer faces a gross misconduct hearing over how the February 2021 reports were dealt with.\n\nA Home Office inquiry is also looking at whether there was a wider failure.\n\nMy straw poll of leading criminal barristers found that they all think Couzens would have been jailed or received a suspended sentence had he been convicted over the 2015 allegation - although the sentence would probably have been short.\n\nBut more importantly, his police career would have been over. He would never have made it into uniform in the Met Police.\n\nEven if he had only been identified in 2020 or early 2021, the suspicion that he was offending would have enough to have him suspended.\n\nThe awful truth is we can't say that Couzens would not have gone on to rape and murder a woman because the crime he was committing would not have led to a sentence longer enough to control him forever.\n\nBut had he been caught and sacked, it would have meant that it would have been far harder for him to trick Sarah Everard into his car - ending her life in awful circumstances and causing untold damage to society's confidence in the police.\n\nHave you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

So, just on price alone, I guess there hasn't been a jump like this ever.\"\n\nAs a way of overcoming the recent cost increases from ingredients to electricity, Tom has started to cut back on flavours - a tough decision having been the one who introduced flavours to his Grandad's plain recipe in the first place.\n\n\"I'm keeping stock of certain things lower because I can't risk having them going out of date by winter,\" he said.\n\n\"I know honeycomb's doubled in price, so I haven't made any of that this year.\"\n\nKnown for their hand-crafted quality ice cream, one company from north Wales is also worried about sales going cold due to rising production costs.\n\nHelen Holland from M\u00f4n ar Lwy, based in Bodorgan, Anglesey, said the business has made several cutbacks over recent years.\n\n\"We need to make the most we can when we're in production,\" she said.\n\n\"We've also decreased our flavours. We still have bespoke and about 25 to 30 different flavours on offer every season, but I'm not as creative as I used to be.\"\n\nReacting to the possibility of losing their favourite flavoured ice cream, many in the seaside town of Aberaeron, Ceredigion, were disappointed.\n\nEating her Kinder Bueno flavoured ice cream, Emily Leonard, from Manchester, said: \"I'd be a bit gutted to be honest, if all the boring ones were left\u2026 you never know what you're going to pick until you look at all the flavours.\n\n\"I feel like the cooler flavours get more attention.\"\n\nIan Roberts is worried about what a lack of flavours might mean for the summer\n\nIan Roberts said his kids enjoyed a variety of flavours.\n\nHe said: \"If there's less flavours, there'd be a little less fun for the summer wouldn't there?\"\n\nA fan of vanilla ice cream, Jane Guest, from Aberystwyth, suggested ice cream makers should raise their prices depending on the flavour.\n\n\"I don't know why they don't sell it at a higher price,\" she said.\n\n\"If it's something like nuts, pistachio and hazelnut, that does cost more.\"\n\nBut she did acknowledge ice cream was already \"quite expensive\".\n\nThings need to change if the industry is to survive, Tom from Conti's says\n\nMr Lewis said he did not think businesses should \"dump\" large premiums on customers and said things would need to change \"drastically\" for the industry to succeed.\n\n\"People need to get back on their feet. Ice cream is a treat, if people are unable to pay their utility fees, they're not going to be buying ice cream,\" he said.\n\nThe UK government said: \"We were clear that we would help people and businesses in Wales through these difficult times and we continue to do so.\n\n\"We are taking action to reduce inflation while making sure real-time financial support is provided to those who need it, with more than 400,000 people in Wales receiving \u00a3301 directly from the UK government in the last few weeks.\"", "A global scamming network has robbed ordinary investors of more than a billion dollars. BBC Eye identified a shadowy network of businessmen who appear to be behind it.\n\nFirst, you hear a phone ringing. An elderly man answers.\n\nThe caller introduces himself as \"William Grant\", from the trading firm Solo Capitals. He says he has a \"great promotion\" to offer.\n\nThe elderly man sounds vulnerable and confused. \"I'm not interested, I'm not interested,\" he says.\n\nBut William Grant is persistent. \"I only have one question,\" he tells the old man.\n\n\"Are you interested in making money?\"\n\nJan Erik, a 75-year-old pensioner in Sweden, is about to get scammed, again. The call was made from the offices of Solo Capitals, a purported cryptocurrency trading firm based in Georgia. The recording is hard to listen to, because not only does the elderly man, Jan Erik, sound muddled, he tells the caller he has already lost one million Swedish Krona (about \u00a380,000) in trading scams.\n\nBut the caller already knows this. And he knows it makes the pensioner a good target for a follow-up \"recovery scam\". He tells Jan Erik that if he hands over his card details and pays a \u20ac250 deposit, Solo Capitals will use special software to track his lost investments and get his money back.\n\n\"We will be able to recover the whole amount,\" William Grant says.\n\nIt takes him a while to wear Jan Erik down. But after about 30 minutes on the phone, the pensioner begins reading out his credit card details.\n\nThe audio recording was saved by the company under the file name \"William Sweden scammed\". The BBC obtained the file from a former employee, but the company had not tried hard to hide it. In fact, it had handed it out to new recruits as part of the company training package.\n\nThis was a lesson in how to scam.\n\nFor more than a year, BBC Eye has been investigating a global fraudulent trading network of hundreds of different investment brands that has scammed unwitting customers like Jan Erik out of more than a billion dollars.\n\nOur investigation reveals for the first time the sheer scale of the fraud, as well as the identities of a shadowy network of individuals who appear to be behind it.\n\nThe network is known to police as the Milton group, a name originally used by the scammers themselves but abandoned in 2020. We identified 152 brands, including Solo Capitals, that appear to be part of the network. It operates by targeting investors and scamming them out of thousands - or in some cases hundreds of thousands - of pounds.\n\nOne Milton group investment brand even sponsored a top-flight Spanish football club, and advertised in major newspapers, lending it credibility with potential investors.\n\nIn November, BBC Eye accompanied German and Georgian police on call-centre raids in the Georgian capital Tbilisi. On the computer screens, we saw row after row of British phone numbers. We phoned several and spoke to British citizens who told us they had just invested money. On one desk, there was a handwritten note with a list of names and useful details for the scammers: \"Homeowner, no responsibilities\"; \"50k in savings\"; \"From Poland, British citizen\"; \"50k in stocks.\"\n\nNext to the name of one British man, a note said: \"Savings less than 10K, very pussy, should scam soon\".\n\nMilton group brands had office space in this downtown Kyiv office building. (Alexander Mahmoud/DG)\n\nThe majority of victims sign up after seeing an ad on social media. Within 48 hours typically they receive a phone call from someone who tells them they could make returns of up to 90% per day. On the other end of the phone there is usually a call centre with many of the trappings of a legitimate business - a smart, modern office with an HR department, monthly targets and bonuses, awaydays and competitions for best salesperson. Some call centres play pumping music in the background. But there are also elements you won't find in a legitimate business - written guidance on how to identify a potential investor's weaknesses and turn those weaknesses against them.\n\nFrom their first phone call, victims can be directed into regulated companies or sometimes unregulated, offshore entities. Some victims who signed up to regulated brands within the Milton group are directed by their broker to place high-risk trades likely to lose the customer money and make money for the broker. Some victims are instructed to download software that allows the scammer to remotely control their PC and place trades for them. And according to former employees of Milton group brands, some customers think they are making real trades, but their money is simply being siphoned away.\n\n\"The victims think they have a real account with the company, but there isn't really any trading, it's just a simulation,\" said Alex, a former employee who worked in a Milton group office in Kyiv, Ukraine.\n\nIn order to better understand how the scam works, the BBC posed as an aspiring trader and contacted Coinevo, one of the Milton group's trading platforms. We were connected to an adviser who gave the name Patrick, and told us we could make \"70% or 80% or 90% as a return in one single day\". He told us to send $500 worth of Bitcoin as a deposit to begin trading with.\n\nPatrick pressed our undercover trader to provide a copy of their passport, and after providing a fake copy we were able to continue to operate the account for about two months before Coinevo appeared to detect the fake. At that point, Patrick wrote to us by email, swearing at us and cutting off contact.\n\nBut the BBC's deposit money was already in the system. We were able to track it as it was divided up into small fractions and moved through many different Bitcoin wallets, all seemingly associated with the Milton group. Experts told the BBC that genuine financial institutions do not funnel money in this way. Louise Abbott, a lawyer who specialises in cryptocurrency and fraud, examined the flow of the money and said it suggested \"large-scale organised crime\". The reason the money was spread over various different bitcoin wallets, Abbott said, was to \"make it as complicated as possible and as difficult as possible for either you, or the victim, or us as lawyers to find\".\n\nThe victims of these telephone trading scams often have their financial and social circumstances used against them. People who reveal large savings pots are pushed to make large investments. People who are lonely are befriended by the scammers. As a recent retiree, Jane (whose name we have changed for this story) was a perfect target. She had just taken voluntary redundancy and had a lump sum of nearly \u00a320,000 that she thought, invested wisely, could supplement her pension in the years to come. In June 2020, during the first lockdown, she saw an ad online for a company called EverFX.\n\nAt that time, EverFX was one of the main sponsors of the top-flight Spanish football team Sevilla FC. The club's stars had advertised the trading platform on social media and - Jane checked - it was regulated by the UK's Financial Conduct Authority.\n\nJane sent EverFX a message through their website and was called back and connected to someone she was told was a senior trader. He told her he was calling from Odessa, in Ukraine, and his name was David Hunt. His accent sounded Eastern European, Jane said, but she couldn't place it. She liked him instantly.\n\n\"He really knew his stuff, he knew how all the markets worked,\" she said. \"I really got into it.\"\n\nJane lost her retirement fund. \"I felt so humiliated,\" she said. \"I didn't want to be on the planet anymore.\" (Joel Gunter/BBC)\n\nSoon they were speaking nearly every morning, and Jane was revealing specific things she needed money for - expensive repairs to her roof, a buffer for her pension. Hunt used them against her, she said, telling her certain trades would \"get her that roof\" and \"help her future\".\n\nOver the next few months, Jane invested about \u00a315,000. But her trades weren't doing well. Hunt advised her to withdraw her money and invest with a different trading platform, BproFX, where she could get better returns.\n\nBy that point, Jane fully trusted David Hunt. \"I felt like I knew him well and I thought he had my interests at heart,\" she said, welling up. \"So I agreed to move with him.\"\n\nWhat she didn't know was that BproFX was an unregulated, offshore entity based in Dominica. In reality, EverFX's UK regulatory status did not stop it from scamming British citizens, but the move over to BproFX would strip Jane of even the scant protections she might be afforded under UK law. The BBC found several victims who were moved to unregulated companies in this way.\n\nIn September 2020, Jane agreed to put \u00a320,000 into BProFX, and Hunt coached her through various trades over the next few months. But somehow she kept losing money.\n\nOther victims told the BBC they were scammed this way. Londoner Barry Burnett said he started investing after seeing an ad for EverFX, but after a few early wins, he suddenly lost more than \u00a310,000 in 24 hours. The adviser pressured him to put in another \u00a325,000 to trade himself out of his black hole.\n\n\"I must have got at least half a dozen calls in the space of about two hours,\" Barry said. \"People begging me to put more money in.\"\n\nJane faced similar pressures from David Hunt. \"He kept telling me that the more I put in the more I can recover,\" she said.\n\nInstead, both finally decided to call it quits. Barry had lost \u00a312,000, Jane \u00a327,000.\n\n\"I'm horrified, numb,\" Barry said. Both made dozens of phone calls, chasing their losses, but with no results. David Hunt stopped answering Jane's calls. She knew she had lost everything.\n\n\"The day I realised was my birthday,\" she said. \"It was the pandemic, and my family had organised a little outdoor get together and brought me a cake, and I was trying to be happy but I just felt so humiliated. I felt like I didn't want to be on the planet anymore.\"\n\nIt would be months before she could muster the courage to tell anyone what she'd done.\n\nThe operations of the Milton group have been investigated before, by the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter and others, but the BBC set out to identify the senior figures behind the global scam.\n\nWe began by combing through publicly available corporate documents to map the connections between companies in the Milton group. Five names appeared again and again, listed as directors of the Milton trading platforms or supporting tech companies - David Todua, Rati Tchelidze, Guram Gogeshvili, Joseph Mgeladze, and Michael Benimini.\n\nWe plugged the five names into the Panama Papers, a massive 2016 leak detailing offshore companies, and discovered that four of them - Tchelidze, Gogeshvili, Mgeladze and Benimini - were listed as directors or senior figures within a group of linked offshore companies or subsidiary companies that pre-dated the Milton group.\n\nMany of these non-Milton companies led back in some way to one figure: David Kezerashvili, a former Georgian government official who served for two years as the country's defence minister.\n\nDavid Kezerashvili, a former defence minister of Georgia, appears to be connected to the Milton network. (Alamy/BBC)\n\nKezerashvili was dismissed as defence minister and later convicted in absentia for embezzling more than \u20ac5m of government funds. By the time of his conviction, he was living in London and the UK turned down a request from Georgia for his extradition.\n\nThere were no publicly available documents linking Kezerashvili to this pre-Milton network, but when we looked at the Panama Papers, his name came up again and again, identifying him as either the founder of the parent companies in the network or as one of their initial shareholders. Behind the scenes, Kezerashvili appeared to be at the centre of that network.\n\nWhen it came to the Milton group, there was similarly no publicly available documentation linking Kezerashvili to the scam companies, and there was no evidence that he had any direct financial interest in the Milton brands.\n\nBut several former employees of Milton-linked companies told us confidentially that they had had direct dealings with Kezerashvili and knew him to be involved in the Milton group.\n\nKezerashvili has frequently promoted the scam trading platforms on his personal social media accounts. On the business networking site LinkedIn, he has used his account almost exclusively to promote jobs and share posts about Milton-linked companies.\n\nThe BBC was able to find a number of other pieces of evidence linking the former defence minister to Milton brands. Several companies owned by Kezerashvili used a private email server on which the only other users were Milton group companies. His venture capital firm, Infinity VC, owned the branding and web domains for companies that provided trading platform technology to the scammers.\n\nKezerashvili also owns a Kyiv office building that was home to both the scam call centre selling EverFX and the tech firms that provided the software - offices which were raided by police in November. He also owns a Tbilisi office block that contained some of the same tech firms.\n\nWhen the BBC examined social media profiles belonging to the four senior Milton group men, it became clear from pictures posted of wedding parties and other social events that they all had close social ties to Kezerashvili. Kezerashvili is Facebook friends with at least 45 people linked to the Milton group scams, and one of the four senior figures identified by the BBC is his cousin.\n\nThe BBC tracked Kezerashvili to his \u00a318m London mansion and asked to speak to him, but we were told he wasn't available. He told the BBC via his lawyers that he strongly denied any involvement with the Milton group, or that he gained financially from scams. He said that EverFX was to his knowledge a legitimate business and his lawyers argued other connections we have found to the people and IT behind it \"proved nothing\".\n\nScam victims download a trading platform, but some are never placing real trades at all. (Joel Gunter/BBC)\n\nMr Chelidze and Mr Gogeshvili also strongly denied our accusations, saying that EverFX was a legitimate, regulated platform. They denied knowledge of Milton or any connection between EverFX and the brands we identified, which they suggested had misused EverFX's source code and brand to confuse users. They said EverFX had never had a crypto wallet and had no control over how its third-party payment processors directed funds.\n\nMr Mgeladze also denied our accusations, telling us that he has never owned any call centres fraudulently mis-selling investments and has no knowledge of the Milton group.\n\nMr Benimini did not respond to our questions.\n\nEverFX denied our allegations, saying that they were a legitimate and regulated platform where risks were fully explained. They said that they had investigated Barry Burnett's case and found that he was responsible for his losses.\n\nIn Jane's case, they told us her losses were as a result of her moving to an unconnected company. They said that they had fully cooperated with the FCA and there were no outstanding UK regulatory complaints.\n\nThe FCA said EverFX was banned by the agency in 2021, along with other similar trading brands.\n\nSevilla FC told the BBC only that once their contract with EverFX ended, they had no more contact with the company.\n\nFraud accounted for more than \u00a34bn worth of crime in the UK last year, and online investment scams are thought to be worth hundreds of millions of pounds per year. But British police have faced criticism from victims over what they see as a lack of action against scammers on behalf of British nationals.\n\nJane went down various routes, at home and abroad, in pursuit of her lost retirement funds, but got nowhere. The UK's City of London Police took a report from her but \"nothing came of it\", she said. Her bank was not able to help either, \"apart from writing a few letters\".\n\n\"And why should they, really?\" she said, with a sad shrug.\n\nSo she did the only thing she could think of. She went to a dozen online review websites and wrote reviews of the trading brands that had scammed her.\n\n\"I just wanted to warn anyone else who might fall for it,\" she said.\n\n\"I put a lot of effort into that. I hope someone sees it.\"\n\nYou can watch the documentary, The Billion-Dollar Scam, on BBC iPlayer, and listen to a radio version on BBC Sounds.", "US President Joe Biden has dropped yet another hint that he will seek re-election in 2024.\n\nMr Biden said on Monday that he \"plans\" on running again but added that he is \"not prepared to announce it yet\".\n\nThe comments came during a casual interview with US broadcaster NBC prior to the annual White House Easter children's party.\n\nMr Biden has previously said it was his \"intention\" to run for another four-year term.\n\nDuring a press conference last November, the president spoke of his desire to seek another term but said he would discuss it with his family over the year-end holidays.\n\nIn February, First Lady Jill Biden said that the timing of the formal announcement was \"pretty much\" all that was left to be decided.\n\n\"How many times does he have to say it for you to believe it?\" she told the Associated Press during a visit to Africa.\n\nWhite House staff had suggested that an announcement could come as early as February but then pushed the possible date to April.\n\nThe latest reports are that Mr Biden may wait until the new campaign fundraising quarter begins in July in order to maximise the amount of time he can gather donations before having to disclose them publicly.\n\nQuarterly fundraising totals are frequently viewed as an important indication of the strength of a campaign.\n\nThere are currently two announced candidates for the 2024 Democratic presidential nomination - best-selling self-help author Marianne Williamson and anti-vaccine activist Robert Kennedy Jr.\n\nNo prominent Democratic officeholders appear to be considering a challenge to the incumbent, however.\n\nThe lack of any formidable rivals in his party has given Mr Biden the ability to set the timing of any formal announcement without significant external pressure.\n\nHis advisers have said he sees an advantage in drawing a contrast between his role governing the nation while his potential Republican opponents engage in partisan campaigning or - in Donald Trump's case - deal with the fallout from a criminal indictment.\n\nLast week, the former president pleaded not guilty in a Manhattan court to falsifying business records.\n\nBehind the scenes, however, Mr Biden and his advisers are quietly assembling a campaign team and staffing the independent political action committee, Future Forward, that will provide financial support for the president's re-election effort.\n\nAt 80, Mr Biden is already the oldest president in US history. If he wins re-election, he will be 86 at the end of his second term.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Jerry Springer says he was born at Highgate underground station during World War II.\n\nIn a bizarre tale on the show's 16th season, a guest named Sandra told Mr Springer she had cut off her own legs with a saw about six years ago.\n\nThe then-48-year-old transgender wheelchair user said she had decided at age 14 that she did not want her legs anymore.\n\n\"My brain just kept saying 'Get rid of them.' So I had to get rid of them,\" she explained, adding that she had previously tried to self-infect so doctors would have to amputate the legs.\n\nShe was later confronted on the show by Kenny, a man born without legs, who lambasted her for her ungratefulness.\n\nMr Springer faced repeated criticism that he was exploiting vulnerable trans people on his shows; he defended himself as somebody who gave transgender Americans more exposure than anywhere else in the entertainment landscape at the time.\n\nEvery fetish imaginable may have made it on screen over the show's three-decade run.\n\nIn 2012's \"Outrageous Guilty Pleasures\" episode, a mother and daughter shared the stage with Mr Springer.\n\nThe two were a dominatrix duo - women who dominate men during sexual activities, often physically.\n\nThings got weirder when the duo brought their sex slave out on stage.\n\nThen, as The Jerry Springer Show so often did, the man's wife also made her way onto set - to berate and kink-shame him.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

including children - on the suspicion that they are liable for removal.\n\nA group of rebel Tory MPs, led by Tim Loughton, tabled an amendment to place new limits on the circumstances in which unaccompanied children could be held.\n\nBut as the bill neared its final Commons passage, he agreed to withdraw it \"on trust\" after Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick pledged he would listen to concerns.\n\nThe government introduced amendments of its own, enabling it to set a unspecified limit on child detention in the future, with Mr Jenrick promising to work with MPs on designing a new limit.\n\nHowever, the commitment was dismissed as vague by the SNP's Alison Thewliss, who added: \"We do not trust them to do the right thing here.\"\n\nMr Loughton said any changes brought forward by the government in the Lords must include a maximum detention time for children within the bill.\n\nChildren's charities - including the NSPCC and Barnado's - have also expressed concern, warning the home secretary in a letter that the bill risks \"denying children the help and protection they need\".\n\n\"We firmly believe that allowing unaccompanied children to be detained for any longer than 24 hours is unacceptable and poses serious risks to their health, safety and protection,\" the charities added.\n\nThe government faced strong criticism from former Prime Minister Theresa May and former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith over the potential impact of the bill on victims of modern slavery.\n\nThe bill would take away temporary protections against removal from the UK that are currently offered to suspected victims of modern slavery or human trafficking while their case is considered.\n\nThe two senior Tories had tabled an amendment, which would have exempted people who have suffered exploitation in the UK from being deported, but they did not force a vote on it.\n\nSpeaking in the Commons, Mrs May said the current version of the bill would mean \"more people will stay enslaved and in exploitation\", by giving traffickers \"another weapon\" to stop victims going to the police.\n\nTo get the bill through, ministers have also promised to consult on new safe and legal routes for migrants, after pressure on the issue from backbenchers.\n\nUnder a new amendment, it has committed to publishing a report on new routes within six months of the bill becoming law.\n\nIt has also addressed concerns from the Tory right with a separate amendment giving UK minsters more leeway to ignore European court rulings.\n\nHowever, even with the government's concessions, the bill is still expected to face significant opposition when it proceeds to the Lords in the coming months.\n\nLabour's shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock said the bill was an \"expensive and unworkable, headline-chasing gimmick\".\n\nLiberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Alistair Carmichael said it was \"nothing more than half-baked legislation that is immoral, ineffective and incredibly costly for the taxpayer\".", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nDriving through the ruined city at night, Vladimir Putin has made his first visit to Mariupol - devastated when Russian forces besieged the city earlier on in the war.\n\nThe BBC has traced part of the route he took, which passed near the locations of several notorious attacks during his army's months-long assault. Russia finally overran the city in May.\n\nVideo released by Russian media show Mr Putin chatting to a companion as they head towards the city's concert hall. The Kremlin says the visit took place late on Saturday and Mr Putin decided \"spontaneously\" to tour the city.\n\nMariupol's Ukrainian mayor in exile Vadym Boychenko told the BBC that Mariupol was \"personal\" to Mr Putin because of what had happened there.\n\n\"We have to understand that Mariupol is a symbolic place for Putin, because of the fury he inflicted on the city of Mariupol. No other city was destroyed like that. No other city was under siege for so long. No other city was subjected to carpet bombing,\" he said.\n\n\"He has come in person to see what he has done,\" he added.\n\nThe BBC identified some of the key landmarks along the Russian leader's route. Mr Putin appears to be driving down Kuprina St, turning into Myru Avenue and then into Metalurhiv Avenue, where the Philharmonic Concert Hall is and which he visits later on in the footage.\n\nHe is sitting next to a man in a black cap, who Russian media identify as Russian Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin.\n\nOn his left as they drive down Myru Avenue are sculptures of birds in what was Mariupol's Freedom Square.\n\nFurther on, on the right and not shown in the footage, is Mariupol's Maternity Hospital Number Three, which was bombed in a notorious incident last March.\n\nPictures of heavily-pregnant Marianna Vyshemirskaya, her face bloodied, descending rubble-strewn steps were widely shared amid outrage at the attack.

Another pregnant woman was among the victims.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called it a war crime but Russia's embassy in London claimed the hospital had no longer been in use, and was instead being used by members of the Azov regiment, which was set up as a volunteer militia with links to the far right in 2014 but had since been incorporated into Ukraine's National Guard.\n\nMr Putin turned off Myru Avenue just before the road arrives at Theatre Square - the scene of a deadly bombing that is thought to have killed at least 300 and possibly as many as 600 civilians.\n\nCivilians had been using the building as a refuge from the siege and a large sign spelling \"children\" had been daubed in Russian in front of the theatre. The building collapsed when it was hit. Russia denied bombing it and blamed the Azov battalion. In December the Ukrainian city authorities in exile said Russia was demolishing the ruins of the theatre.\n\nRussia \"understood where there was a concentration of people, and deliberately destroyed these places, killing people. They systematically worked on this\", said Mr Boychenko.\n\nFootage then shows Mr Putin on a walking tour of a new residential compound, said to be in Mariupol's Nevsky district. He is guided by Mr Khusnullin, who shows him some plans of the reconstruction work. He is also seen talking to people said by Russian media to be local residents and he also visits an apartment that he is told is made up of three rooms.\n\nNevsky is a new district comprising a dozen apartment blocks in the west of the city. It is named after the River Neva, on which President Vladimir Putin's home city of St Petersburg stands.\n\nMayor Boychenko said many of the Russian-built buildings were on the city outskirts. \"They built this just to prove that their version of what's happening there is true. But they lie! They lie that they came to liberate the city. But they destroyed it. This city does not exist any longer. And it takes 20 years to restore it!\" he said.\n\nMariupol residents have been telling the BBC that new buildings are going up and some of those damaged by the Russian military are being removed. The UN estimates that 90% of residential buildings were damaged or destroyed in the Russian onslaught.\n\nNorwegian journalist Morten Risberg, who visited Mariupol in December, said he saw \"large-scale rebuilding and restoration\" amid \"destruction everywhere you looked\".\n\n\"They're changing street names and they're painting over Ukrainian colours with Russian colours, and they're putting Russian flags everywhere,\" he told the BBC. Most of the remaining civilians in the city were \"just focusing on surviving\", he said.\n\nIn another part of the footage, President Putin is seen walking through the interior of a concert hall in Mariupol. Russian state media said it was the Philharmonic Concert Hall - and the BBC has verified that the footage matches the interior of the venue.\n\nThis is the same building that the UN warned was to be used to stage trials of Ukrainian troops who held out against Russian forces for months in Mariupol's massive Azovstal iron and steel plant. Russia finally gained complete control of Mariupol in May after the defenders surrendered.\n\nThe concert hall was to be the venue for show trials of Ukrainian POWs but they were traded in a prisoner swap instead\n\nImages posted on social media in August - including by Ukrainian authorities - appeared to show metal cages being built on the stage. According to the UN, prosecuting prisoners of war (POWs) for taking part in hostilities is a war crime.\n\nBut the trials never took place, as the POWs were later part of a prisoner swap for 55 prisoners from Ukraine, including a pro-Kremlin former MP, Viktor Medvedchuk.\n\nThe latest footage from inside the concert hall shows the interior of the building has since been redecorated and the cages are no longer visible.\n\nDuring the siege the concert hall, like the drama theatre, was used by civilians for shelter. The cultural institutions were \"where people hid in basements and waited for the Russian terror to end,\" Mr Boychenko said.\n\nBefore the invasion it had been the venue for the Mariupol Classic festival for classical music. Mr Boychenko said the festival was a \"great celebration of classical music for the people of Mariupol\" that drew artists from abroad and other parts of Ukraine.\n\n\"Many people always gathered at this festival to feel the mood that always prevailed in Mariupol,\" he said.\n\nIn a later shot, President Putin is seen visiting a World War Two memorial built to commemorate Soviet troops who recaptured the city from Nazi Germany.", "Images have emerged purportedly showing Wagner fighters training Belarusian soldiers at a base south-east of Minsk\n\nUkraine's border guard service has confirmed that Wagner mercenaries have now arrived in Belarus from neighbouring Russia.\n\nThe DPSU says it is assessing how many \"militants\" are in Belarus, which also shares a border with Ukraine, as well as their exact location and goals.\n\nOne unconfirmed report said a convoy of some 60 Wagner vehicles rolled over the border into Belarus early on Saturday.\n\nA deal ended the 24-hour rebellion, which saw the troops seize a city and march on Moscow - aborting it just 200km (124 miles) from the capital.\n\nUnder the agreement, Wagner fighters were told they could join either the regular Russian army or go to Belarus, a close ally of Russia. The Wagner leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, was also offered a move to Belarus, however his current whereabouts are unknown.\n\nWagner is a Russian private military company made up of mercenary fighters - many of whom were recruited from Russian prisons. They have fought some of the bloodiest battles since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February last year.\n\nDPSU spokesman Andriy Demchenko confirmed Wagner's presence in Belarus in a short statement on Saturday.\n\nHe said Ukrainian border guards were \"continuing to monitor the situation\" across the country's northern border. He provided no further details.\n\nEarlier in the day, a Telegram channel associated with a prominent Belarusian opposition blogger reported that a large Wagner convoy entered Belarus from Russia.\n\nBelaruski Hajun channel said the vehicles - including pickups, lorries and buses - were being accompanied by Belarusian traffic police as they headed to the town of Osipovichy, about 85km (53 miles) south-east of the capital Minsk.\n\nThe Belarusian authorities - which view Belaruski Hajun as an extremist channel - have not commented on the issue.\n\nOn Friday, Belarus' defence ministry said Wagner troops were now acting as military instructors for the country's territorial defence forces. It said the fighters were training Belarusian forces \"in a number of military disciplines\" near Osipovichy.\n\nEarlier this week, President Putin revealed that Prigozhin had rejected an offer for his fighters to join the Russian army as a regular unit.\n\nHe told Russia's Kommersant newspaper that many group commanders had backed the plan, to be led by a senior Wagner figure, during talks in Moscow on 29 June.\n\nBut he said that Prigozhin's reply was \"the guys [Wagner troops] do not agree with this decision\".\n\nMr Putin also said that under Russian law, Wagner \"does not exist\", because mercenary groups are not officially recognised. But that \"difficult issue\" should be discussed in parliament, the president added.\n\nThe Kremlin appears to want to differentiate between the Wagner chief and regular Wagner fighters, driving a wedge between them, says the BBC's Russia editor Steve Rosenberg in Moscow.\n\nHe adds that this would explain the attempts in Russia's state media to discredit Prigozhin.\n\nSince the 23 June mutiny, there have been conflicting and unconfirmed reports of Prigozhin's whereabouts.\n\nHe is a former Putin loyalist and once even nicknamed \"Putin's chef\" for his catering contracts with the Kremlin. But public infighting between Prigozhin and Russia's ministry of defence over the conduct of the war have put him at steep odds with Russia government.\n\nUS President Joe Biden said on Thursday that Prigozhin should be careful of poisoning following the mutiny.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Breaking current smoking rules is punishable with a fine of up to HK$1,500 ($192, \u00a3147).\n\nBut he also said when police \"arrive at the scene, the crime may have already stopped\" and so they are unable to take action, going on to suggest smoking rules should be enforced like etiquette over waiting for a bus.\n\n\"No one will say it requires the law to compel people to queue.

As Formula 1 heads to the iconic Suzuka circuit for the Japanese Grand Prix this weekend, BBC Sport F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your questions. Is Toto Wolff's position under scrutiny? Third year the car has underperformed drastically, no improvement in sight, top driver leaving. Andrew: Over the past couple of years since Mercedes started struggling in Formula 1, reports that Toto Wolff's position might be under threat have periodically emerged. These misunderstand Wolff's position at Mercedes, where he is chief executive officer and team principal at the F1 team and director of Mercedes motorsport. Wolff is a one-third owner of the team. Mercedes itself and Sir Jim Ratcliffe's Ineos company also own one-third each. So he can't be sacked in the same way as a football manager might be.\n\nAfter the Australian Grand Prix, when it became clear that Mercedes were still struggling to understand their car, Wolff was asked whether he felt he was still the right person to lead the team. He said: \"As a co-owner of this business, I need to make sure my contribution is positive and creative. I would be the first one to say if somebody has a better idea, tell me, because I am interested to turn this team around as quickly as possible. \"We have a physics problem and not a philosophical or organisational problem. Because we haven't taken a dumb pill since 2021. It's just we don't understand some of the behaviours of the car that in the past we would have always understood.\" Sam: Daniel Ricciardo's form doesn't look good enough to get a Red Bull seat. Yuki Tsunoda looks unlikely too. Who gets the seat if Max Verstappen or Sergio Perez goes? Andrew: At the moment, neither Ricciardo nor Tsunoda are likely to get a Red Bull seat in 2025 if either Verstappen or Perez leave. Ricciardo has been out-performed by Tsunoda since he returned to F1 midway through last season - it looks at the moment as if the Australian has yet to recover the form he previously showed at Red Bull and Renault before his dip after joining McLaren. And Ricciardo is at risk of being dropped before too long this season and being replaced at RB by reserve driver Liam Lawson, who impressed when he stood in for Ricciardo last season. And Red Bull motorsport adviser Helmut Marko does not rate Tsunoda, who was forced on him by engine partner Honda. Some inside RB say that is unfair, and that Tsunoda has been performing at an elite level so far this season. But Marko remains to be convinced. That being the case, the contenders for any vacant Red Bull seat are the same ones as those for any other vacant seat at a top team - with Fernando Alonso and Carlos Sainz at the top of the list of potentials. Peter Gilmour: Is F1 becoming a closed shop for new drivers? Could there be a type of promotion/relegation with the drivers from F2? Andrew: No, it's not. Oliver Bearman's performance in Saudi Arabia has made it extremely likely that he will get a seat in F1 next year. And Mercedes are nurturing their 17-year-old protege Andrea Kimi Antonelli for a move to F1, perhaps as early as next year. If young drivers are good enough, they will get an F1 opportunity. There is no appetite for a formal promotion-relegation of drivers from F2. That's not how driver selection works. It's not a league system. David Dunford: With the cost cap restricting teams in funding, improvements and reliability of cars, should there not be a better way to allow teams to catch up? Andrew: The bosses of F1 would argue that the cost cap and the other systems in place to try to level the field need to be given time to work. Remember that as well as the budget cap, there is a sliding scales of restrictions on aerodynamic research, with the most successful teams permitted the least and the least successful the most. This has only been in place since 2021 and it will inevitably take time to have an effect. The field spread has come down dramatically in that period - from 2.4 seconds between the fastest and slowest cars on average in qualifying in 2020 to 1.4secs last year. David Irvine: Is the DRS automatic or is it controlled by the drivers? Has there ever been a penalty for using it incorrectly and are drivers monitored? Andrew: The DRS (drag-reduction system) overtaking aid is driver-operated. He presses a button on the steering wheel when he crosses the line that marks the start of a zone where it may be used. It only works if the car is within the requisite one second of the car in front. It shuts automatically when he hits the brakes.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "Leah Croucher's coffin was pulled by a horse drawn carriage through the streets of Milton Keynes\n\nMourners cried as they lined the streets to pay their respects to teenager Leah Croucher.\n\nThe 19-year-old's body was found in the loft of a house in Milton Keynes in October.

That's mind blowing.\"\n\nEd Thomas' production of Pren ar y Bryn/Tree on a Hill is being filmed in both Welsh and English\n\nNearly a decade ago the English version of the detective thriller Y Gwyll/Hinterland was sold internationally, with a number of bilingual series since following the same pattern.\n\nIt was produced and directed by Ed Thomas, whose latest production Pren ar y Bryn/Tree on a Hill is also being filmed in both languages.\n\n\"At the moment, we have the same model as we had with Y Gwyll, filming back-to-back,\" he said, adding an English version could been needed to secure funding.\n\nWelsh director Ed Thomas says series need to be made bilingually to get funding\n\nWhile taking pride in the success of Dal y Mellt, Mr Thomas said there was \"a long way to go\" before productions got enough funding for Welsh-only versions that sell internationally.\n\n\"That's what we have to target is to ensure, that if we're on Netflix or Apple or Amazon Prime or whatever it is, that they also follow it up with real investment in the Welsh language.\"\n\nMs Gravelle said now was the time to take advantage of audiences getting accustomed to watching programmes in different languages using subtitles.\n\n\"As we've been watching over the last few years, really popular series that aren't in English like Squid Games, Lupin and Money Heist that shows if you have a good story, and if you have good drama, it will travel.\"", "Recep Tayyip Erdogan (left) refuses to ostracise Russia's leader Vladimir Putin after he launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine\n\nYou can spot Turkey's global strategic significance - which has starkly increased against the backdrop of the Ukraine war - by the A-list potpourri of world leaders who rushed to congratulate Recep Tayyip Erdogan on his election win on Sunday night.\n\nFirst out of the box was Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nHe was so keen to stroke the ego of his Turkish counterpart and fellow \"strongman\" leader that he didn't even wait for the official results of the vote before singling out Mr Erdogan's \"independent foreign policy\" as a reason for his victory.\n\nWe can safely assume the Turkish policy that Russia is particularly fond of is Mr Erdogan's refusal to ostracise the Kremlin after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, even as Turkey's allies in Nato imposed sanctions and slashed their energy reliance on Russia.\n\nTrade between Turkey and Russia even increased significantly since the start of the war in Ukraine.\n\nBut also hot on Mr Putin's congratulatory heels on Sunday were US President Joe Biden and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron.\n\nDespite their dislike of Mr Erdogan's cosying up to the Kremlin and his slashing of free speech and democratic norms at home during his first two decades in power, to them Turkey is a crucial - if difficult and unpredictable - ally of the West.\n\nTurkey is a key member of the Nato military alliance, taking part in all its missions.\n\nMr Erdogan may maintain close ties with Russia - but he also provides military aid to Ukraine.\n\nHe famously brokered a deal whereby Russia ended a blockade on Ukraine grain supplies, allowing them to flow to parts of the world that rely on them. He also - after long hesitation - gave his official approval to Russia's neighbour Finland joining Nato.\n\nOnce a passionate advocate of Turkey joining the EU, Mr Erdogan these days speaks of \"making Turkey great again\".\n\nFor him, that has entailed having a more independent foreign policy. Over the years, he's developed highly transactional relationships with all his allies.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThe White House has made no secret of its impatience to try to persuade Mr Erdogan to approve Nato membership for Sweden too.\n\nSweden would provide important Baltic Sea cover for the alliance against Russia.\n\nThe West hopes the dire state of Turkey's economy - and the likelihood that Mr Erdogan will have to concentrate on stabilising finances and attracting foreign investment - could prove a soft spot to push for Sweden's Nato accession as a quid pro quo.\n\nTurkey and Hungary are the only Nato countries still blocking Stockholm's membership.\n\nPresident Macron, meanwhile, worries about migration to the EU and hopes to win assurances from President Erdogan as soon as possible.\n\nDuring the migration crisis of 2015 more than a million refugees and asylum seekers - mainly from Syria - made the perilous journey across the Mediterranean to the EU in people-smugglers' boats.\n\nBrussels subsequently made a deal with Turkey. In exchange for a large sum of money and visa-free travel for Turks into the EU - the latter never fully arrived because of EU objections to Mr Erdogan's jailing of critics and political opponents - the Turkish president would do his best to prevent migrants without papers leaving Turkish waters to reach the bloc.\n\nBut swelling numbers of Syrian refugees at home proved extremely unpopular with Turkish voters.\n\nThis month, every political party running in Turkey's parliamentary elections promised to take action to solve \"the migrant issue\".\n\nThe EU frets about the prospect of refugees being pushed back by Turkey into Syria at risk to their safety - and of Turkey allowing people smugglers free rein again to send boats of asylum seekers and other migrants over the Mediterranean.\n\nBrussels is also on the defensive as EU member Greece is involved in a number of disputes with Mr Erdogan centred on the Aegean Sea, while EU member Cyprus is still seething after Mr Erdogan called for a two-state solution (Greek and Turkish) to decades-long divisions there following a Turkish invasion nearly 50 years ago.\n\nThe West used to describe Turkey's strategic importance as the bridge between Europe and the Middle East - but Russia's invasion of Ukraine has transformed Turkey's status.\n\nFew expect big foreign policy surprises from Mr Erdogan as he enters his third decade in power. But Ankara's strategic allies are watching very closely indeed.", "A 14-year-old girl died and five other people were injured in the blaze\n\nA 16-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a 14-year-old girl died in a fire at a block of flats in east London.\n\nThe girl was found in a second-floor flat that was damaged in the blaze in Tollgate Road, Beckton, at about 17:30 BST on Thursday.\n\nFive people were also injured but have since been discharged from hospital, Scotland Yard said.\n\nDetectives said they were treating the fire as arson.\n\nWitness Rahina Begum said the flames \"went up very quickly, within a few seconds\".\n\nMs Begum, who lives opposite the flats, added: \"In 10 to 15 seconds the whole building was on fire, from the bottom to the top.\n\n\"The flames were so high.

Watch: US Vice-President Kamala Harris says those involved in atrocities \"will be held to account\"\n\nThe US has \"formally determined\" that Russia had committed crimes against humanity in Ukraine, US Vice-President Kamala Harris has said.\n\nSpeaking at the Munich Security Conference, Ms Harris accused Russia of \"gruesome acts of murder, torture, rape and deportation\" since its invasion.\n\nMoscow's ambassador to the US rejected the claims and accused Ms Harris of trying to \"demonise Russia\".\n\nWorld leaders at the conference called for long-term support of Ukraine.\n\nUK PM Rishi Sunak said now was the time to \"double down\" on military support.\n\nThe prime minister argued that Western allies must start planning for the future security of Ukraine, as well as sending the weapons it needs to defend itself now.\n\nThe conference in Germany comes as the one-year anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine approaches on 24 February.\n\nMs Harris told delegates that the perpetrators of alleged Russian crimes in Ukraine must be held to account.\n\n\"Their actions are an assault on our common values and our common humanity,\" she said.\n\nThe UN defines crimes against humanity as a \"widespread or systemic attack\" on a particular civilian population.\n\nMoscow has repeatedly denied targeting civilians during its invasion.\n\nAnatoly Antonov, Russia's ambassador to the US, said the vice-president's claims were a cynical attempt to \"demonise Russia in the course of a hybrid war\".\n\nThey were a way of \"justifying Washington's own actions to fuel the Ukrainian crisis\", he added, referring to the US supply of arms to Kyiv.\n\nBut Ms Harris, a former prosecutor, was adamant that \"in the case of Russia's actions in Ukraine we have examined the evidence, we know the legal standards, and there is no doubt: these are crimes against humanity\".\n\nShe cited \"barbaric and inhumane\" atrocities committed during the war in Ukraine, including the scores of bodies found in Bucha shortly after the invasion and the bombing of a theatre in Mariupol.\n\n\"Let us all agree: on behalf of all the victims, both known and unknown, justice must be served,\" Ms Harris said.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nCrimes against humanity are tried at the International Criminal Court (ICC).\n\nBut the ICC has no powers to arrest suspects and can only exercise jurisdiction within countries which signed up to the agreement that set up the court.\n\nRussia is not a signatory to that agreement, so it is unlikely to extradite any suspects.\n\nThe three-day gathering in Munich will provide a key test of Western support for Kyiv as both sides in the war prepare for spring offensives.\n\nUkraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Moscow had \"waged a genocidal war\" because it did not think Ukrainians \"deserve to exist as a sovereign nation\".\n\nTens of thousands have lost their lives and millions have been forced from their homes as part of Vladimir Putin's invasion.\n\nThis conference has largely been a gathering of American and European leaders.

She opposed sending more arms to Ukraine and called for a peaceful resolution to the war. Her country, she said, had suffered recession, rising prices and disrupted supply chains.\n\nIt's opinions like that, widely held cross Africa, Asia and South America, that are concentrating transatlantic minds.\n\nThere is realisation among Western policymakers that almost one year after Russia's invasion, they need to remake the case for defending Ukraine.\n\nRussia was also on the agenda during a meeting on Saturday between the Antony Blinken and Wang Yi, the US and China's top foreign policy officials.\n\nDuring talks at the conference in Munich, Mr Blinken warned of consequences if China were to provide material support to Russia's invasion.\n\nMr Blinken is expected to suggest China is \"at least contemplating providing\" lethal assistance to Russia in an interview to be aired on Sunday morning on NBC News.", "The latest season of Never Have I Ever helped to fuel subscription gains\n\nA burst of people signed up for Netflix this spring, after the streaming giant cracked down on password sharing.\n\nThe company ended June with more than 238 million subscribers, adding 5.9 million members since March.\n\nThat was bigger than expected and follows efforts by the company to re-ignite growth following unusual subscriber losses last spring.\n\nIt is also facing challenges from ongoing strikes in the US by writers and actors.\n\nNetflix said it would spend less on content this year than expected as a result of the walkout - the industry's biggest in six decades, while boss Ted Sarandos said \"we need to get this strike to a conclusion\".\n\n\"This strike is not an outcome that we wanted,\" he said.

It is one self-contained room with a kitchenette and a small bathroom accessed by its own door.\n\nHe is part of the Homes for Ukraine scheme which started just over a year ago to help rehome refugees who fled the country following Russia's invasion in February 2022.\n\nSo far, according to government figures 153,000 Ukrainian refugees have arrived in the UK and research suggests most of them have stayed.\n\nTo help with the expense of housing refugees, hosts are provided with \u00a3350 per month for the first 12 months and \u00a3500 for each month after that point.\n\nLike millions of other fixed-rate mortgage holders in the UK, Dominik's loan was coming up for renewal this year so he decided to look around for a new deal.\n\nAnd that's when the trouble - and worry - started.\n\nHalifax sent someone to value Dominik's home.\n\nHe said: \"We spoke directly with the valuer before, when he came and looked at our house.\"\n\nBut Dominik said \"When we contacted the Halifax through our broker they said they could not provide us with a mortgage because we were providing accommodation to a Ukrainian family and therefore there was a significant risk that we would rent out the room commercially in the future.\"\n\nHalifax has since apologised for \"the confusion\" after being contacted by Money Box and has offered Dominik a mortgage deal.\n\nBut Dominik claims the only reason Halifax backed down is because Money Box started to investigate. \"We raised it twice with the Halifax through our mortgage broker and nothing changed,\" he said.\n\n\"It is very unfortunate that it took Money Box to get a response.\"\n\nHalifax said it is \"very sorry for the confusion\" and is very supportive of the Homes for Ukraine scheme and that it wouldn't decline a mortgage application on this basis.\n\n\"Having reviewed the application again, we've now issued an offer and the application will proceed as normal,\" it said.\n\nMillions of Ukrainians have fled the country because of Russia's invasion\n\nHalifax said the valuer did not appreciate the informal nature of the tenancy, and this was reflected in their report where they noted the property was unsuitable for these lending purposes and given a zero valuation.\n\nDominik said that he was worried that Halifax's refusal could have been mirrored by the rest of the lending sector. \"We did not know at the time if other banks might have reacted similarly,\" he said.\n\n\"We have since secured a mortgage with another bank so, fortunately, it has not had any impact on our finances.\"\n\nHe added: \"Had we not been able to secure a new mortgage we would have moved from a fixed-term mortgage to a higher rate and cost us over \u00a39,000 a year.\"\n\nThe government has advised people who are hosting refugees through the Homes for Ukraine scheme to keep any interested parties informed.\n\nAre you part of the Homes for Ukraine scheme and hosting a family, or know someone who is?

The fierce battle has taken on huge symbolic importance for both sides.\n\nUkrainian officials have also said they are using the battle to kill as many of Russia's troops as possible and wear down its reserves.\n\n\"Russia's attempt at an offensive in the Donbas [region] largely through Bakhmut has failed,\" Mr Kirby told reporters. \"Russia has been unable to seize any real strategic and significant territory.\n\n\"We estimate that Russia has suffered more than 100,000 casualties, including over 20,000 killed in action,\" he added.\n\nThe toll in Bakhmut accounts for losses since the start of December, according to the US figures.\n\n\"The bottom line is that Russia's attempted offensive has backfired after months of fighting and extraordinary losses,\" Mr Kirby said.\n\nHe added he was not giving estimates of Ukrainian casualties because \"they are the victims here. Russia is the aggressor\".\n\nThe BBC is unable to independently verify the figures given and Moscow has not commented.\n\nA local resident pushes his bicycle down a street in Bakhmut in January\n\nThe capture of the city would bring Russia slightly closer to its goal of controlling the whole of Donetsk region, one of four regions in eastern and southern Ukraine annexed by Russia last September following referendums widely condemned outside Russia as a sham.\n\nAnalysts say Bakhmut has little strategic value, but has become a focal point for Russian commanders, who have struggled to deliver any positive news to the Kremlin.\n\nThe Wagner mercenary group - which widely uses convicts and has become notorious for its often inhumane methods - has taken centre stage in the Russian assault on Bakhmut.\n\nIts leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has staked his reputation, and that of his private army, on seizing the city.\n\nBut he recently threatened to pull his troops out of Bakhmut.\n\nIn a rare in-depth interview to a prominent Russian war blogger, he vowed to withdraw Wagner fighters if they were not provided with much-needed ammunition by the Russian defence ministry.\n\nWagner fighters could be redeployed to Mali, he warned.\n\nHe has often clashed with Russia's defence ministry during the war, accusing officials of not providing his fighters with enough support.\n\nMr Prigozhin also called upon the Russian media and military leadership to \"stop lying to the Russian population\" ahead of an expected Ukrainian spring counteroffensive.\n\n\"We need to stop lying to the Russian population, telling them everything is all right,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the Ukrainian military's \"good, correct military operations\" and command.\n\nA top Ukrainian general said on Monday that counterattacks had ousted Russian forces from some positions in Bakhmut, but the situation remained \"difficult\".\n\nNew Russian units, including paratroopers and fighters from Wagner, are being \"constantly thrown into battle\" despite taking heavy losses, Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, the commander of Ukraine's ground forces, said on Telegram.\n\n\"But the enemy is unable to take control of the city,\" he said.", "Israeli's defence minister has been sacked after he spoke out against controversial plans to overhaul the justice system.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu summoned Yoav Gallant to a meeting and told him he no longer had faith in him as defence minister.\n\nThe plan to limit the powers of the judiciary led to months of protests.\n\nTens of thousands of protestors returned to the streets on Sunday night following Mr Gallant's dismissal.\n\nIn Jerusalem, police and soldiers used water cannon against demonstrators near Mr Netanyahu's house.\n\nThe leaders of the protest accuse Mr Netanyahu of behaving like a dictator and destroying the security of Israel.\n\nThe new law makes it harder for courts to remove a leader deemed unfit for office, which has angered many who consider it in the interests of the incumbent, Benjamin Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption.\n\nThe leader of the opposition, Yair Lapid, described Mr Gallant's sacking as a new low for the government, while Mr Gallant himself has described the planned legislation as an \"immediate and tangible danger\" to state security.\n\nIn a brief televised statement on Saturday night, Mr Gallant said members of the Israeli Defence Forces were angry and disappointed, with an intensity he had never seen before.\n\nShortly after his dismissal a day later, Mr Gallant wrote on Twitter: \"The state of Israel's security has always been and will always be my life's mission.\"\n\nThe defence minister had won the backing of some fellow members of Mr Netanyahu's Likud party, but others on the far right had called for him to go.\n\nThe law is part of the right-wing coalition government's contentious plan to limit the powers of the judiciary.\n\nThe reforms include plans that would give the government full control over the committee which appoints judges, which he has said will pass in the Knesset next week.\n\nFar-right national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir supported Mr Netanyahu's move, saying,\"The prime minister decided on the necessary step and I congratulate him for that.\"\n\nIt includes enabling parliament to overrule decisions made by the Supreme Court - a move that critics say will undermine the independence of the judiciary and could be used for political ends.\n\nBut Mr Netanyahu says the reforms are designed to stop the courts overreaching their powers and that they were voted for by the public at the last election.\n\nIsrael's opposition leader Yair Lapid described Mr Gallant's sacking as \"a new low\" for the government.\n\n\"Netanyahu can fire Gallant, but he can't fire reality or fire the people of Israel who are fronting up to resist the coalition's madness,\" Mr Lapid added.\n\nFormer defence minister Benny Gantz praised Mr Gallant, who he said had put the security of the country above all interests.", "The fighting has been particularly fierce in the capital, Khartoum\n\nRepresentatives from Sudan's warring armies have arrived in Saudi Arabia for their first face-to-face negotiations.\n\nThe \"pre-negotiation talks\" between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) were due to start on Saturday in Jeddah. They are sponsored by the US and Saudi Arabia.\n\nSeveral ceasefires have broken down since the fighting began weeks ago.\n\nBoth sides have said they will discuss a humanitarian truce but not an end to the conflict.\n\nThere has been no word so far about whether the meeting has taken place or who the representatives from both sides are.\n\nSaudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan welcomed the representatives from both parties. He said he hoped the talks would \"lead to the end of the conflict and the return of security and stability to the Republic of Sudan\".\n\nGen Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, who leads the RSF, said on Twitter that the group appreciated all efforts to establish a ceasefire and provide the Sudanese people with aid. He also insisted the RSF was committed to \"the transition to a civilian-led government\".\n\nGen Daglo, better known as Hemedti, is engaged in a bitter power struggle with Sudan's army commander, Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan - the country's de facto president.\n\nSaturday's talks come amid reports of continuing clashes in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum.\n\nHundreds of people have been killed and nearly 450,000 civilians displaced since the fighting began. Of that total, the International Organization for Migration says, more than 115,000 have sought refuge in neighbouring countries.\n\nA joint US-Saudi statement urged \"both parties to take in consideration the interests of the Sudanese nation and its people and actively engage in the talks towards a ceasefire and end to the conflict\".\n\nA spokesman for UN children's agency, James Elder, said the conflict's first 11 days alone had killed an estimated 190 children and wounded 1,700 - and those figures were just from health facilities in Khartoum and Darfur.\n\n\"The reality is likely to be much worse,\" he said.\n\nThe intensity of the fighting has prevented much-needed aid deliveries getting through.\n\nSo far Gen Burhan and Hemedti, who led an Arab militia in the brutal Darfur conflict, have shown little readiness to reach a peace settlement.", "That's it then for the third day of witness hearings in the Covid inquiry. More evidence will be taken tomorrow before the first senior politicians, including former Prime Minister David Cameron, appear in front of Baroness Hallett next week.\n\nA quick recap of what was said today:\n\nBruce Mann, a former civil servant in the cabinet officer and Professor David Alexander from University College London, presented their joint report on the structures and systems which should have been in place in a national emergency like Covid.\n\nThey found that planning for a \u201cnovel diseases pandemic\u201d like coronavirus was \"wholly inadequate\" and said it was clear that both the health and social care sectors in England were liable to be overwhelmed.\n\nBoth men would like to see a radical rewrite of the UK\u2019s emergency plans going forwards saying a future pandemic is \"inevitable\".\n\nThis morning we heard from Prof David Heymann, now at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, but one of the top officials in the World Health Organisation in 2003 when the first Sars outbreak hit countries in Asia.\n\nProf Heymann said that Sars and another related disease, Mers, had a \"profound effect\" on countries like Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. He believes those countries were more successful than the UK and other European countries in containing the early spread of Covid in 2020 as a result, noting \"much, much lower\" mortality rates.", "TV presenter Sophie Morgan was left \"in a rage\" at the \"injustice\" of her Blue Badge being stolen from her car.\n\nThe Loose Women star, who uses a wheelchair, said she would have to wait weeks for her car to be fixed and a replacement Blue Badge issued.\n\n\"I literally can't describe how disabling this is,\" she said, adding the inconvenience was \"beyond measure\".\n\nBlue Badges are issued by your local council and are displayed on the car's dashboard.\n\nThey are proof you are disabled and enable you to get free or longer term parking as well as entitling you to use disabled parking bays which tend to be closer to destinations.\n\nSophie was away working in America when her car back in London was broken into, earlier this month. The perpetrators \"smashed the window on the passenger side,\" she told the BBC's disability podcast, Access All.\n\n\"I had this rage in me at the injustice, all the frustration, the inconvenience, all of those feelings,\" she said.\n\nThe only item taken was her Blue Badge, but the loss of it hugely impacts her life.\n\n\"I can't drive my car without my badge as I can't get in or out [of the vehicle] without space to get my wheelchair beside my car,\" she said.\n\n\"And without the guarantee of a disabled space, it's not worth the risk.\"\n\nThe incident was reported to her local council but now Sophie must wait for a replacement to be issued.\n\nLISTEN: You can hear more from Sophie on the BBC Access All podcast.\n\nAnd adaptive clothes designer Victoria Jenkins, who was recently on Dragon's Den, and model Caprice-Kwai chat about the world of fashion.\n\nAccording to the Department for Transport, in the year ending March 2022, 1,497 badges were reported as stolen across the UK.\n\nThey can be vulnerable to opportunists with some suggestion they can be re-sold for hundreds or even thousands of pounds.\n\nSome people even buy lockable Blue Badge holders which are attached to the vehicle's steering wheel to protect them.\n\nIt is why some London councils have started moving towards \"Companion Passes\" which work alongside Blue Badges, but are digital and negate the threat of theft.\n\nHaringey Council, in north London, launched its Companion Pass in August 2021 to enable people to park in locations across the borough.\n\nBetween January and June 2021, 528 incidents relating to Blue Badges had been reported. A year later, after the scheme had been introduced, that dropped to 185 for the same time period, a reduction of 65%.\n\nAs well as working in resident parking zones, it also enables holders to travel through low traffic neighbourhoods (LTN). Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras are able to pick-up and verify the vehicles.\n\n\"It's been really transformational,\" Councillor Mete Coban says, the cabinet member for energy, waste and transport, who has offered to speak with other councils to get the scheme up and running.\n\nBut he acknowledges it's not a complete solution.\n\n\"It has to be the vehicle registered to your home address. So that's one of the limitations,\" he said, acknowledging they can only be linked to one vehicle, unlike the physical Blue Badge which can be used by the holder in any vehicle they are traveling in\n\nThese Companion Passes also only work within the borough they are issued.\n\nSophie's own council, Southwark, does operate a Companion Pass which enables holders to park in any disabled bay, Pay-by-Phone bay and exempts them from \"Streetspace measures\" - Southwark's version of LTNs.\n\nFor Sophie, who wasn't aware of the scheme, it's a positive move towards reducing the anxiety around Blue Badge thefts and waiting for replacements.\n\n\"It saves people work. It saves people the hassle. It's just a no-brainer.\"\n\nYou can find more information on the BBC Access All podcast.", "Most police forces and other emergency services have confirmed they are able to receive 999 calls again, following a fault on Sunday morning.\n\nEarlier, a nationwide technical issue meant calls were not being connected.\n\nSome said they were still experiencing a \"residual impact\" so people should only use 999 in a genuine emergency.\n\nBT confirmed the issue was caused by a technical fault, and said a back-up system was being used while it worked to restore the primary 999 lines.\n\nIt said its priority was getting the lines \"up and running as soon as possible\" and experts were trying to work out the cause.\n\nThe telecoms company has already ruled out a third-party issue, the hot weather and an Android handset 999 problem from earlier this week.\n\nBut it said it would not be able to share technical information on the system nor how the back-up works because the 999 call service is part of the critical national infrastructure.\n\nBT also warned that call handling times might be \"slightly longer than normal\", but urged people to call 999 as usual.\n\nProblems with the service were first reported at about 08:30 BST on Sunday.\n\nBy about 10:00 some emergency services were saying services had been restored and by midday most emergency services said call services had been restored.\n\nForces who were still experiencing issues around lunchtime included Essex Fire Service, South Wales Police, the PSNI, and Police Scotland.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police said 999 lines were \"very busy following the technical fault that impacted all emergency services earlier\".\n\nIt said the back-up system was \"not as effective at telling us where you are calling from\", and for people to have the address or street information available when they call.\n\nCheshire Fire and Rescue Service warned of a 30-second delay to connect to 999, while Suffolk Police said its system may not be working to full capacity and urged people to use 999 only in a genuine emergency.\n\nEast Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS) said if a 999 call was not successful, people should call 111 for urgent medical help instead.\n\nRichard Lyne, strategic commander at EMAS, said: \"We urge people to seriously consider the alternative services available and if it's possible to make your own way to a treatment centre.\n\n\"For example, if a relative or friend can take you by car.\"", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThe Prince of Wales has paid tribute to his \"Pa\" King Charles the day after the Coronation, saying the late Queen Elizabeth II would be \"a proud mother\".\n\nAddressing the crowds at Windsor Castle for the Coronation concert, William said his grandmother was \"up there, fondly keeping an eye on us\".\n\nHe said this weekend was \"so important\" because it was all about service.\n\nHighlighting King Charles' achievements over the last 50 years, William said: \"Pa, we are all so proud of you.\"\n\nAnd the heir to the throne made his own vow to the nation, saying: \"I commit to serve you all.

Your Majesty, you can be my wingman any time,\" before saluting and banking off.\n\nThe King seemed to enjoy a skit involving Bonneville and Muppet Show stars Kermit and Miss Piggy, in which Miss Piggy said \"King Charlesy Warlesy\" was expecting them in the royal box.\n\nAt the end of the show, Kermit was seen to have made it to the box, waving a flag in front of Prince Edward but there was no sign of Miss Piggy.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

That was down from a peak of more than 9% last year, when prices were rising at the fastest pace in four decades.\n\n\"We think they're at a point where the Fed funds rate is restrictive enough to slow the economy, slow activity and allow inflation to trend lower,\" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at insurance firm, Nationwide Mutual, adding that she did not expect to see further hikes this year.\n\nThe Fed has already brought interest rates up from near zero less than 18 months ago, putting to an end an era of low-cost borrowing that started during the financial crisis.\n\nThe moves have hit the public in the form of more expensive loans for homes, business expansions and other activity.\n\nIn theory, that should reduce borrowing demand and encourage saving, eventually cooling the economy and making it harder for firms to raise prices.\n\nBut the economy in the US has held up better than many expected so far - especially in the labour market, where jobs continue to be added at a robust pace and wages are rising.\n\nMr Powell said he expected the job market would have to weaken further and growth slow more before the Fed could be confident its job was done.\n\n\"It's not that we're aiming to raise unemployment but we have to be honest about the historical record,\" he said.\n\nWhile acknowledging progress, he also noted that so-called core inflation - which does not include food and energy prices - remained more than double the Fed's 2% inflation target.\n\nAndrew Patterson, senior economist at Vanguard, said the Fed was worried about declaring victory prematurely, mindful of mistakes made in the 1960s and 1970s, when bank leaders embraced signs that inflation was easing only to see the problem flare up again.\n\n\"They had a positive inflation report this past month but ... they're going to want to see more of that going forward before they're comfortable,\" he said. \"They're not going to take anything off the table or pin themselves into a corner.\"\n\nDavid Henry, investment manager at Quilter Cheviot, said the Bank of England and European Central Bank were \"much further behind\" than the US on controlling inflation, which could lead to a \"bifurcation\" or division in policy among developed economies.\n\n\"They would love to have luxury that the Fed has in declaring the job nearly done, but instead talk is of rates of 6%, if not more,\" he said.\n\nHe added: \"There is a chance the US begins talking about rate cuts before the BoE has had a chance to pause and assess the impact of its actions, and this would have a significant impact on stock and bond prices on both sides of the Atlantic.\"", "Former senior party whips have told the BBC a \"professional\" HR system is needed in Parliament to handle sexual misconduct allegations against MPs.\n\nIt comes ahead of a debate on Monday on whether to ban some MPs under investigation for violent or sexual offences from Parliament.\n\nCurrently, there is no single authority at Westminster that deals with sexual misconduct cases against MPs.\n\nWhips are senior MPs in charge of their party's discipline and welfare.\n\nBut they are often expected to handle misconduct cases.\n\nSome allegations are reported to Parliament's Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme, some to parties or whips, some to the Commons Speaker or leader of the House, and some to police.\n\nThe BBC has spoken to multiple senior MPs and former MPs, who have served as whips for different parties.\n\nMany argue Parliament needs a formal HR system to stop allegations being dealt with in different ways, on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\"There should be a better HR system for the employment of members' staff,\" said a former chief whip, who wanted not to be identified.\n\nMPs currently hire their staff directly, but the former chief whip argued they should be employed in the same way as ministers' special advisers.\n\n\"Although they are the appointment of the minister, they are centrally employed, and come under the HR umbrella of the rest of the civil service.\n\n\"That would give [MPs' staff] the protection of being able to speak to somebody else other than their employer, where it might be a very small office.\n\n\"So their employer is not necessarily the member of Parliament, but the House authorities,\" they said.\n\nFormer Conservative MP Anne Milton was deputy chief whip from 2015-2017\n\nOthers the BBC spoke to, who have served as whips, also said they wanted HR \"beefed up\" to help resolve grievances and other issues, citing a lack of clarity and training for whips on how to handle such cases beyond directing individuals to complaint processes, support services, or even the police.\n\nFormer deputy chief whip Anne Milton told the BBC: \"In the short period of time I was involved with the allegations against Charlie Elphicke, I was clear that the whips' office was not the place to consider issues such as this.\n\n\"You can help people through difficult periods in their life - but the whips' offices are not equipped and don't have the expertise to deal with complaints of this nature.\"\n\nElphicke was a Conservative MP who was suspended by the party after \"serious allegations\" were referred to the police, and was subsequently convicted of sexual assault.\n\nMs Milton added: \"I felt that the House of Commons - because allegations of misbehaviour or sexual harassment or sexual assault bring the House of Commons into disrepute - that the House of Commons needs to deal with that.\n\n\"You need a process that should be handled by an external organisation, who are professionals, to investigate allegations swiftly.\"\n\nShe said the whips' office was an instrument of the party leadership - and in the case of the government, its role was to get government business through Parliament.\n\n\"The whips' offices do not have the HR skills needed.\"\n\n\"Trying to crack the nut of MPs acting like small businesses is quite a difficult nut to crack. But using an external agency to resolve workplace issues is not difficult.\n\n\"Neither Parliament nor the whips' offices are equipped to do it. This is highly specialised stuff.\"\n\nShe said whips could remove the whip from MPs, but \"that's a political party decision\".\n\n\"The whips shouldn't be enacting sanctions as part of the complaints process. It may be considered prudent by a political party to withdraw the whip pending an investigation.\"\n\nCurrent MPs have also raised concerns about a lack of \"HR professionals\" to deal with cases like this.\n\nOne Conservative MP said: \"Where does the buck stop? The whips, the police, the Speaker, there's also the parties. I don't see that there is any formal coming together of those.\"\n\nParties often \"live in fear of someone saying: 'why didn't you take action?' That's where the judgement comes,\" they added.\n\nThis MP said that, while they still wanted a say in who their staff were, \"I do think there's a benefit in more HR support for MPs - I'm not an HR expert.\"\n\nThey compared MPs employing their own staff with Parliament \"dealing in effect with 650 small businesses\".\n\nAnother former chief whip the BBC spoke to echoed the argument for \"external supervision\", saying the role of the whips was to \"look after their flock, not to sit in judgement of them\", and to persuade them to vote with their party the \"right\" way.\n\nOn Monday, MPs will debate proposals to bar some MPs under criminal investigation for violent or sexual offences from setting foot in Parliament.\n\nThe proposals have been drawn up by the House of Commons Commission, a body of senior MPs which oversees the working of the Commons, following a consultation.\n\nIf approved, the plans could allow MPs or peers to be barred from the Houses of Parliament if they are deemed to pose a risk.\n\nThe exclusion would apply to the parliamentary estate in Westminster and any parliamentary-funded travel.\n\nMPs are being asked to have their say on the plans, but a formal vote has yet to be arranged.\n\nThe Commission has proposed that if the parliamentary authorities were presented with credible allegations of a sexual or violent offence by the police at any point in the criminal justice process, a staff panel would assess the claims.\n\nIf the panel undertook a full risk assessment on the basis of information provided by the police, it would consider the nature of the alleged misconduct and whether there were any safeguarding concerns.\n\nIf this led to exclusion being recommended, this would be put to an adjudication panel for a decision.\n\nUnder the proposals, excluded members would get a proxy vote so their constituents were not disadvantaged.\n\nThe BBC has been told there is some disagreement on the plans - with a number of MPs arguing members should not be excluded unless they are charged by police, and others arguing that the threshold for exclusion should be lower.\n\nOne former chief whip said excluding people who had not been charged flew \"against natural justice\".\n\n\"Allegations can be made against members of parliament that may be false, and they may be made in a vexatious way.\"\n\nMs Milton said she believed Parliament should be able to vote on excluding MPs from the Commons, because it was \"quite a serious issue democratically\".\n\n\"Their [MPs'] job is to hold the government to account. If you're going to withdraw an MP's ability to do this on behalf of their constituents. that's serious enough for the whole House to make a decision.\"", "Police cars were parked outside the temporary housing unit in Sidegate Lane on Friday\n\nA man and woman have been charged with murder following the death of a two-year-old girl.\n\nThe body was found by police at a temporary housing unit in Sidegate Lane, Ipswich, at about 11:45 BST on Friday.\n\nSuffolk Constabulary said officers arrested two people in Bury St Edmunds in the early hours of Saturday.\n\nScott Jeff and Chelsea Gleason-Mitchell are now due to appear at Ipswich Magistrates' Court on Wednesday.\n\nThe force said that the pair - both aged 22 and of no fixed address but previously from Bedfordshire - were known to the victim.\n\nFloral tributes were left at the housing unit after the toddler was found dead on Friday\n\nFurther tests were required as part of the post-mortem examination, officers said.\n\nSuffolk Constabulary also said a mandatory referral had been made to the Independent Office for Police Conduct because of previous police contact with the deceased \"elsewhere\".\n\nAnyone with information is asked to contact police.\n\nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Unite said that \"spot rates, salary ranges and formal pay progression will increase when the pay increase is implemented\".\n\nUnite added the deal also included improved maternity and paternity benefits.\n\nEarlier in June, Heathrow security officers at Terminals 3 and 5 said they would walk out for 31 days in the summer after turning down a pay offer of 10.1%, which they said was \"below inflation\".\n\nInflation as measured by the Consumer Prices Index is now at 8.7%, but another measure - the Retail Prices Index - stood at 11.3% in the year to May.\n\nWorkers in several industries across the UK have been taking industrial action, mainly over demands for pay to stay in line with the soaring cost of living.\n\nExtensive walkouts by rail staff have continued since 2022, and industrial action has also led to walkouts by those including nurses, junior doctors, Border Force staff and civil servants.\n\nUnite regional co-ordinating officer Wayne King said: \"The solidarity and dedication of Unite's reps and members was fundamental in ensuring HAL [Heathrow Airport] returned to the negotiating table with an improved offer\".\n\nHeathrow security staff working at Terminal 5 had walked out for 10 days in April during the Easter holiday period, although the airport said it had suffered \"minimal\" disruption.", "Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has made curbing illegal migration one of his main priorities\n\nThe home secretary is expected to be given the ability to ignore attempts by European judges to halt migrant deportations from the UK.\n\nThe change will be made to the Illegal Migration Bill, after the government made concessions to Conservative MPs.\n\nThe move should avoid a rebellion from some MPs, who have been demanding tougher action against the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).\n\nThe change will be made in amendments when the bill returns to the Commons.\n\nAs part of the amendment, Home Secretary Suella Braverman is expected to gain the power, in certain circumstances, to ignore interim injunctions from the court, known as Rule 39 orders, that halt deportation flights.\n\nThe Strasbourg-based court, unpopular with the Tory right, used an injunction of this type to block the removal of migrants to Rwanda last year.\n\nRebel Tory MPs say they have also agreed with ministers that British judges will only be able to halt deportations where there is a risk of serious and irreversible harm.\n\nBBC Newsnight has been told some movement is also expected on the provision of safe and legal routes for refugees to come to the UK - which is a key demand of another group of Conservative MPs.\n\nThe migration legislation, which was set out by Ms Braverman last month, would prevent anyone entering the UK illegally from claiming asylum.\n\nIt is central to Mr Sunak's pledge to stop small boats crossing the English Channel, but has provoked outrage among charities and opposition parties, who say it breaches international law.\n\nSome Conservative MPs, however, believe it does not go far enough and tabled a series of changes to the bill.\n\nLast month, some of those MPs withdrew their proposals in Parliament after immigration minister Robert Jenrick said he would engage with those who have concerns.\n\nConservative MP Danny Kruger, who was among those leading the calls, said he was \"grateful to the prime minister and the home secretary for their work\".\n\nMr Kruger said the British public \"are fed up with London lawyers and Strasbourg judges getting in the way of a sensible migration policy\".\n\nHe said he was \"hopeful that the government will be able to deliver the prompt removals to Rwanda and other safe countries\".

He rang NHS 111 and was sent to A&E. He was diagnosed with stage 3 bowel cancer, which was successfully treated with surgery.\n\nThe gold standard treatment is to then have intravenous chemotherapy to mop up any remaining tumour cells and reduce the risk of the cancer returning.\n\nBut the chemotherapy used in bowel cancer, oxaliplatin, can cause painful tingling and numbness in the hands and feet, called peripheral neuropathy.\n\nThis nerve damage can be long-term, and Ben was worried it might affect his ability to do the job he loves.\n\n\"I would not be able to cope with that,\" he says. \"I need to work - it's my therapy.\"\n\nThe 52-year-old enrolled in a study at London's Royal Marsden Hospital, which is evaluating whether a blood test can show if chemo is really needed.\n\nHis test showed he was clear of cancer, so he avoided intravenous chemotherapy.\n\nInstead, like everyone taking part in the trial, he took an oral chemo tablet twice a day. This had minimal side effects and allowed him to carry on working.\n\n\"The fact that I didn't have any tingling in my hands has just been an absolute blessing,\" he says.\n\nBen's blood is extracted for the liquid biopsy\n\nThe blood tests work by looking for microscopic traces of cancer in the bloodstream called circulating tumour DNA. The presence of these markers indicates whether the patient has been cured by their surgery or not. Such tiny fragments would be invisible on a scan.\n\nBen's consultant at the Marsden, Dr Naureen Starling, is the principal investigator on the trial. She says the outcome could affect the way thousands of bowel cancer patients are treated every year.\n\n\"Half of patients with stage 3 bowel cancer are cured by surgery alone, so we are over-treating a large proportion of patients,\" she says.\n\nThe hope is that this specialised technology could spare many cancer patients unnecessary chemotherapy.\n\n\"That's good for the patient, it's good for the health service, it's good for cost savings within the NHS. That would be a win-win,\" says Dr Starling.\n\nThe liquid biopsies being packaged to send to California\n\nThe trial, called TRACC, is using a test created by US company Guardant Health. The samples are sent to their labs in California for analysis with the results coming back within around two weeks.\n\nThe trial, funded by the National Institute for Health & Care Research (NIHR), will examine any difference in survival rates after three years between those patients whose treatment was guided by the blood test compared with the standard-of-care chemotherapy group.\n\nTrials are also under way in the UK to monitor patients with lung and breast cancer in the same way.\n\nDr Starling says the potential for this new technology across cancer care is \"immense\", not just when it comes to detecting residual disease after surgery, but also for early diagnosis.\n\nWhat is clear already, from multiple studies, is that so-called \"liquid biopsy\" blood tests can reveal the lingering presence of cancer long before it would be found using traditional methods.\n\nA trial in Greece published in Nature in January, found that liquid biopsies could show cancer recurrence at least four years before it would be detectable via a scan. That study followed a small group of breast cancer patients after surgery.\n\nAt the American Society of Clinical Oncology conference in Chicago last June, a study in 455 bowel cancer patients found that by using the blood tests to guide treatment, the number of patients needing post-surgery chemotherapy was nearly halved without the risk of relapse.\n\nBut Dr Starling says the far bigger randomised trial in the UK is essential to calibrate exactly how much reliance can be placed on liquid biopsies, especially when it means considering the withdrawal of chemotherapy.\n\nThe tests have already been available to private patients.\n\nSusanne Winter, an artist from Surrey, was diagnosed with stage 3 bowel cancer in March 2022 and had successful surgery to remove the tumour and some cancerous lymph nodes.\n\nShe initially thought she would need chemotherapy to ensure the cancer was entirely gone, but she had the ctDNA test done privately which showed she was clear of cancer.\n\nSusanne, 58, had cancelled all her commitments to prepare for several months of chemotherapy, but the negative test result meant she was free to concentrate on her art. She even had two works accepted for the Royal Academy summer exhibition.\n\nShe feels incredibly lucky to have avoided chemotherapy. \"I knew how toxic it can be. You're psyching yourself up for it, so to hear that you aren't going to need it is just unbelievable,\" she says.\n\nSusanne Winter was able to carry on painting\n\nWhat is considered the holy grail of cancer detection is to be able to spot the disease at the very earliest stage, when it is most easy to cure.\n\nBlood tests are also being trialled to see if they can diagnose a whole range of cancers.\n\nMore than 140,000 volunteers aged 50-77 have been recruited across England to see if the test could pick up more than 50 types of tumours, most of which have no screening programmes.\n\nThe NHS-Galleri trial is made by Californian company Grail, and some interim results are due early next year.", "Rishi Sunak has faced questions over shares held by his wife, Akshata Murty\n\nRishi Sunak has referenced his wife's shares in a childcare firm in his published list of financial interests, after a conflict-of-interests row.\n\nThe PM has faced questions over Akshata Murty's shares in Koru Kids, a childcare agency which could benefit from a policy in last month's Budget.\n\nHe faces a parliamentary probe after not mentioning them during a committee appearance last month.\n\nOn Tuesday, Labour called on him to \"come clean\" and publish his interests.\n\nDowning Street resisted the call to publish them on Tuesday, saying it had no plans to publish Mr Sunak's interests separately to the wider list of interests for all ministers.\n\nIt said that work to compile the list, which is managed by the PM's ethics adviser, was \"ongoing\".\n\nThe full list for all ministers, including Mr Sunak, has now been published less than 24 hours later, for the first time in nearly a year.\n\nA Labour spokesperson, however, said the PM had shown a \"complete lack of transparency\" - and the whole process for financial declarations needed to be reviewed.\n\nThe government has faced criticism about the late publication of the list, which and is meant to be published twice a year but was last updated 11 months ago.\n\nThe position of ethics adviser was unfilled during a six-month period last year, before current holder Sir Laurie Magnus was appointed in December.\n\nOn Monday, Downing Street said Mr Sunak had told government officials about the shares during routine conflict-of-interest declarations, which are not made public.\n\nThe PM's spokeswoman declined to say when he declared the shares to officials when asked by reporters on Wednesday, citing the confidentiality of the process.\n\nThe shares were not mentioned in the latest publicly available version of the list, published in May 2022 when Mr Sunak was chancellor.\n\nThis public version of the list only includes financial and other interests considered \"directly relevant\" to ministers' roles, including those held by close family members.\n\nThe updated version, published shortly before Mr Sunak appeared at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, now references the shares as part of a \"number of direct shareholdings\" held by his wife.\n\nIt also revealed that deputy PM Dominic Raab has paid for lawyers out of his own pocket to represent him during the ongoing inquiry into allegations he bullied civil servants in previous government roles, which he denies.\n\nJeremy Hunt, who became chancellor in October, has also updated his list to include his stake in a property company he owns jointly with his wife, and half-shares in a holiday house in Italy and an office in London. He has previously published these interests in his separate register as an MP.\n\nThe updated list also shows that eight government ministers, including Mr Hunt and Mr Sunak, hold financial interests in so-called blind trusts or management arrangements, with a further two in the process of setting them up.\n\nThese arrangements, where management of assets is placed in the hands of advisers in a bid to avoid conflicts of interest, are regularly used by ministers with significant financial interests.\n\nCompanies House records indicate Ms Murty has held shares in Koru Kids since 2019, and are mentioned in filings as recent as last month.\n\nHer shareholding was not mentioned in several previous versions of the list of ministers' interests published whilst Mr Sunak was a minister at the Treasury, and then subsequently chancellor.\n\nWhen asked why that was, the PM's spokeswoman said previous decisions about what to include were made by past ethics advisers - and overruling them could affect future declarations made by others.\n\nOn Monday, it emerged Mr Sunak is being investigated by Parliament's standards commissioner, after not mentioning the shares during a committee appearance last month where he was questioned about the new childcare policy in the Budget.\n\nWhen asked by a Labour MP whether he had any interests to declare, he replied: \"No, all my disclosures are declared in the normal way.\"\n\nThe MPs' rulebook says they should be \"open and frank\" about \"relevant\" financial interests when speaking in Parliament.\n\nA pilot of bonuses for childminders was announced in the Budget on 15 March as part of the government's overhaul of childcare. Koru Kids is one of six childminder agencies listed in government guidance on childminder agencies.\n\nUnder the scheme, childminders who sign up to the profession will be paid \"incentive payments\" of \u00a3600.\n\nThis would rise to \u00a31,200 for those who join through an agency, meaning the pilot might generate more business for companies such as Koru Kids.\n\u2022 None How big a deal is inquiry into PM's declarations?", "The Israeli military said troops were blocking roads in the area and searching for the attackers\n\nTwo British-Israeli sisters have been killed and their mother has been injured in a shooting in the occupied West Bank.\n\nThey were in a car that crashed after being shot at near the Hamra Junction, in the north of the Jordan Valley.\n\nThe mayor of the settlement of Efrat said the sisters, who were in their 20s, and their 48-year-old mother lived there and were immigrants from the UK.\n\nThe UK Foreign Office said it was \"saddened\" by the news.\n\n\"We are saddened to hear about the deaths of two British-Israeli citizens and the serious injuries sustained by a third individual,\" a statement said.\n\nThe Israeli military said its forces were blocking roads in the area and had \"started a pursuit of the terrorists\".\n\nThe shooting took place hours after Israeli warplanes carried out air strikes in southern Lebanon and the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe military said they were in retaliation for the biggest rocket attack on Israel launched from Lebanon for 17 years, which it blamed on the Palestinian militant group Hamas.\n\nThe rocket barrage followed two nights of Israeli police raids at the al-Aqsa mosque in occupied East Jerusalem that caused anger across the region.\n\nLater on Friday, Israel said one person had died and several others had been injured in a separate shooting incident in Tel Aviv.\n\nThe Israel military said the earlier incident in the Jordan Valley was initially reported as a collision between an Israeli car and a Palestinian car. But when troops arrived they found several bullet holes in the Israeli vehicle and determined that it was an attack.\n\nIsraeli public broadcaster Kan reported that 22 bullet casings were found, apparently from a Kalashnikov assault rifle.\n\nA volunteer medic with the United Hatzalah ambulance service said he rushed to the scene and found the three victims in a critical condition.\n\n\"Together with other first responders, I performed CPR on the injured in an attempt to save their lives,\" Oded Shabbat said. \"One injured person was transported by helicopter to the hospital for further care.\"\n\nThe Efrat Local Council said in a Facebook post that the three women were a mother and her two daughters who lived in the West Bank settlement, which is south of Jerusalem. It added that it was not yet permitted to identify them.\n\nThe mayor of Efrat, Oded Revivi, said the family were immigrants from the UK, originally from London, and that they were travelling to Tiberias, located on the shores of the Sea of Galilee, for a holiday when the attack happened.\n\nIsraeli media also cited Mr Revivi as saying that the sisters' father had been driving ahead of them in another car when theirs was attacked. He reportedly turned around and arrived at the scene to find his wife and daughters being treated by paramedics.\n\nThe head of the Israeli military's Central Command, which oversees the West Bank, called it an \"extremely severe terrorist attack\" and promised that its troops knew how to find those responsible.\n\n\"We are reinforcing forces in all sectors. We were unable to prevent this attack, but we will do everything we can to prevent the following attacks,\" Maj-Gen Yehuda Fuchs added.\n\nIsrael Police commissioner Kobi Shabtai meanwhile called on all Israelis with firearms licences to start carrying their weapons.\n\n\"This is a murderous attack that reminds us how relevant the threat of terrorism in its various forms is,\" he said.\n\nHamas did not claim it was behind the shooting but praised it as \"a natural response to [Israel's] ongoing crimes against the al-Aqsa mosque and its barbaric aggression against Lebanon and the steadfast Gaza\".\n\nThere has been an intensification of violence between Israel and the Palestinians since the start of this year.\n\nMore than 90 Palestinians - militants and civilians - have been killed by Israeli forces.

'Unite behind us and we can defeat the SNP' - Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross\n\nThe Conservative party has rejected a suggestion from its leader in Scotland that voters could tactically back Labour to oust the SNP.\n\nSpeaking to the Sunday Telegraph, Douglas Ross said \"where there is the strongest candidate to beat the SNP, you get behind that candidate.\"\n\nIt would be a case of parties doing \"what's best for the country\", he said.\n\n\"This is emphatically not the view of the Conservative Party,\" a Tory spokesperson said.\n\n\"We want people to vote for Conservative candidates wherever they are standing as that's the best way to keep Labour and the SNP out.\"\n\nIn most of the SNP's constituencies, that would actually mean voting Labour or Liberal Democrat.\n\nIn his interview, Mr Ross said: \"The public know how to tactically vote in Scotland...\n\n\"I will always encourage Scottish Conservative voters to vote Scottish Conservatives.\n\n\"But I think generally the public can see, and they want the parties to accept, that where there is a strongest candidate to beat the SNP, you get behind that candidate.\n\n\"If parties maybe look a bit beyond their own narrow party agenda to what's best for the country - and for me as Scottish Conservative leader, what would be best is if we see this grip that the SNP have on Scotland at the moment is loosened.\"\n\nBut later on Sunday, Mr Ross sought to clarify his position, insisting this did not mean encouraging Conservative voters to vote for other parties.\n\nHe told BBC Scotland: \"I urge every Scottish Conservative voter to vote Scottish Conservative and I would always do that.\n\n\"But we also know that in many parts of the country, the Scottish Conservatives are the biggest challengers to the SNP so if supporters of other parties unite behind the Scottish Conservative candidate, we have the best possible chance of defeating many SNP MPs.\n\n\"That will clearly send a message that the public want our politics in Scotland focused on their real priorities - not a divisive independence referendum.\"\n\nHe added: \"It is up to other party leaders to suggest what they are doing in the seats they are targeting.\n\n\"If the supporters of other parties unite behind us we can defeat the SNP and get a result similar or better than what happened in 2017 when the SNP lost a significant number of MPs.\"\n\nLabour's Jackie Baillie said voting for Labour would be all they would ask people to do\n\nWhile local council elections are taking place across much of England and Northern Ireland in May, no seats are up for grabs in Scotland or Wales.\n\nThe next general election must take place on or before 28 January 2025, but it is widely expected that one will be held in the weeks or months before this date.\n\nThe SNP has dominated the last three general elections in Scotland.\n\nAlthough Labour has only one Scottish MP, the party has hopes of returning more. But that does not mean tactical voting pacts.\n\nScottish Labour deputy Jackie Baillie told BBC Scotland: \"There is no mistake in this. We are asking people to vote Labour.\n\n\"If they want to see the back of the Conservatives in the UK government because they have had enough of being let down by them and they want to see the back of the SNP in Holyrood, then the only vote that will do that is a Labour vote.\n\n\"That is all we are asking people to do. Nothing else.\"\n\nThe SNP said a pact could not be ruled out after a number of deals were done with the Tories in councils across Scotland following last year's local elections.\n\nThe party's deputy leader Keith Brown said: \"It shows just how little difference there is between the Tories and the pro-Brexit Labour party that Douglas Ross is willing to endorse them instead of his own party.\n\n\"Keir Starmer has taken Labour so far to the right that they are now just a pale imitation of the Tories - backing Brexit, supporting brutal austerity and attacking devolution.\"\n\nIt is not the first time Douglas Ross and Scottish Conservatives have broken with the main party line.\n\nIn January last year, the Scottish leader said the position of the then Prime Minister Boris Johnson was \"no longer tenable\" after Mr Johnson admitted attending a Downing Street party during lockdown.\n\nMr Ross later rowed back on this position following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMr Ross's remarks come at a time of crisis for the SNP in the wake of Nicola Sturgeon's resignation as first minister and party leader, and the arrest of her husband Peter Murrell.\n\nMr Murrell, the former SNP chief executive, has been questioned over the party's finances.

Now they will see if Iran and Hezbollah are going to push back.\n\nThere will be a response, but it may not be the one people expect.

The Iranian embassy next door did not appear to have sustained any significant damage.\n\nThe Iranian ambassador, Hossein Akbari, said Israeli F-35 fighter jets \"brutally targeted my place of residence and the consular section of the embassy, along with Iran's military attaches\". He told Iranian state TV that between five and seven people were killed, including some diplomats.\n\nLater, the Revolutionary Guards put out a statement saying that seven of its officers were killed, including Brig-Gen Mohammad Reza Zahedi and Brig-Gen Mohammad Hadi Haji-Rahimi, whom it described as commanders and \"senior military advisers\".\n\nIranian media said Zahedi, 63, was a senior figure in the Quds Force - the Revolutionary Guards' overseas operations arm - and served as commander in Lebanon and Syria between 2008 and 2016. Haji-Rahimi was meanwhile identified as Zahedi's deputy.\n\nZahedi is one of the most high-profile Iranian figures believed to have been killed by Israel in the country's long campaign of targeted assassinations.\n\nThe UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which relies on a network of sources on the ground in Syria, reported that eight people were killed - a high-ranking leader of the Quds Force, two Iranian advisers and five members of the Revolutionary Guards.\n\nSyria's Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad said he strongly condemned what he called \"this heinous terrorist attack\", adding that it had killed \"a number of innocent people\".\n\nIn a telephone conversation with Mr Mekdad, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian described the strike as \"a violation of all international obligations and conventions\" and \"blamed the consequences of this action on the Zionist regime\", the Iranian foreign ministry said.\n\nHe also \"stressed the need for a serious response by the international community\".\n\nA White House spokeswoman said US President Joe Biden was aware of the reports.\n\nIn a briefing to journalists on Monday, IDF spokesperson Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said an apparent drone attack on a naval base in the southern Israeli city of Eilat was \"a very serious incident\".

A day at the beach that would save Lucy Humphrey's life\n\nLucy Humphrey potentially only had a few years to live when she took a trip to the beach with her partner and two dogs.\n\nBut thanks to a chance encounter with a stranger \"chosen\" by one of her pets, her life was saved.\n\nAfter living with lupus - a condition which causes inflammation to the heart, lungs, liver, kidneys and joints - for more than a decade and a half, her kidneys failed.\n\nDespite dialysis, in 2019 she was told she might only have five years to live without a transplant.\n\nShortly before that, Lucy, 44, and her partner Cenydd Owen, 49, both from Caerphilly, bought a campervan to take the dogs, two Dobermans named Jake and Indie, away on the weekend, but their plans to use it were put on hold by treatment.\n\nThey had planned a two-day break to Aberystwyth in June 2021 - four-and-a-half years after Lucy's kidney failure - but she was too unwell to travel that far.\n\nThey decided to go to Cold Knap beach in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, instead.\n\nLucy and Cenydd parked their campervan overlooking the beach and set themselves up with a barbecue with their dogs.\n\n\"Indie kept going over to this woman about 100 yards away,\" Lucy said.\n\nIndie, Lucy and Cenydd's dog who \"chose\" Katie at the beach\n\n\"She kept going back and forward to her and we kept calling her back, because obviously a big Doberman can be a little bit intimidating.\n\n\"We thought she had food or something and Cenydd kept calling her back. In the end we went over to apologise to her.\"\n\nThe stranger was Katie James, a 40-year-old, from Barry.\n\nShe sat at the beach crocheting and it turned out she didn't mind Indie going over to her.\n\nKatie (left) was initially invited by Lucy (right) to her beach barbecue\n\n\"She was actually having quite a bad time herself, so I invited her to our barbecue,\" said Lucy.\n\n\"She came over, bought some drink over with her, and offered me some.\n\n\"Cenydd explained that I couldn't drink as I was on dialysis. She was like 'oh what's that for', and he said she's waiting for a kidney transplant.\"\n\nSurprised, Katie explained: \"Oh I've just gone on the kidney donation register!\"\n\n\"Who are you going to donate your kidney to?\" asked Cenydd.\n\n\"Anyone who wants it,\" Katie replied.\n\nKatie and Lucy swapped numbers and contacted a donor coordinator the next day.\n\nLucy, Katie and Cenydd at the hospital\n\n\"She had all the tests and it turned out she was a perfect match,\" said Lucy.\n\n\"A surgeon told us it's a one in 22 million chance to find the perfect match, and that's what I needed as I've got Lupus.\n\n\"The transplant took a little while, as Covid was going on at the time, so it kept being postponed.\"\n\nIn the lead up, Katie set up a group on WhatsApp called The Kidney Gang.\n\n\"All her visits to the hospital she was updating us and sending recorded messages and pictures,\" said Cenydd.\n\n\"I've still got all the recordings and how excited she was that she was doing something good. It's just mad a total stranger and Lucy's got her life back.\n\nLucy and Katie recovering from the transplant in hospital\n\n\"For the last five years, she couldn't drink anything and she was restricted on what she could eat. Now, she can eat and drink what she likes and we're starting to get our life back to normal.\"\n\nDespite complications in the initial weeks afterwards, Lucy said the transplant, which took place on 3 October 2022 at University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, was a success.\n\n\"We went in together on the Sunday, and on the Monday morning they took us down, took my kidney out, popped it into Lucy and Bob's your uncle,\" said Katie.\n\n\"I feel really lucky that I got to know Lucy, I know that its worked and I know that she's out there living her life. To me, there's been no negative to it whatsoever.\n\n\"I feel really proud of myself, I get embarrassed sometimes though as every time I'm out with my nan she will tell a stranger 'oh my granddaughter donated a kidney'.\n\n\"It's the best thing I've ever done and I feel so proud of myself and my family are proud of me.\"\n\nLucy, Cenydd and Katie still regularly meet up\n\n\"It was the fact that Indie almost sussed her out and chose her,\" said Lucy.\n\n\"They did tell me a few years back I only had about five years, dialysis doesn't work forever, and you can only have so many access lines put in as well.\n\n\"I really needed this transplant, I'd been on the waiting list for several years. It's completely changed my life already.\"\n\nHowever, he said: \"She doesn't like my jokes, and said if I don't stop telling her jokes, she wants her kidney back. She never signed up for my jokes.\n\n\"We ended up going to Barry by total chance, meeting Katie by total chance, and Lucy's ended up with a kidney.\n\n\"We want to show that there is always hope for people. Never give in, because you never know, we weren't even going to go to the beach that day. There's a lot of good people out there.\"", "Figures show more than 26,000 people in Northern Ireland are using a food bank for the first time\n\nA record number of food parcels was distributed in Northern Ireland in the past year by the UK's largest food bank network.\n\nThe Trussell Trust provided 81,084 emergency food parcels between April 2022 and March 2023.\n\nThat represents the most food parcels the charity has ever distributed in the region in a single year.\n\nThe trust said it was \"particularly alarming\" that more than 35,000 emergency parcels were for children.\n\nThe latest figures are also higher than the number of food parcels delivered during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, almost a third higher than in 2021-22 and more than double the figure in 2018-19.\n\nThe Trussell Trust network has 51 food banks and distribution centres in Northern Ireland and more than 1,600 across the UK.\n\nBut the charity said that as many other organisations also run food banks, its figures do not fully reflect their overall use.\n\nSome community and church groups across Northern Ireland also run independent food banks.\n\nJonny Currie, Northern Ireland lead for the Trussell Trust, said he is \"incredibly concerned at the increasing level of need\" across Northern Ireland.\n\nHe told BBC News NI the situation was the worst he had ever seen.\n\n\"We are seeing that a range of people from all sorts of backgrounds are having to rely on emergency food, from folks who are struggling on social security to be able to pay for the essentials, through to people who are in work,\" he said.\n\n\"So roughly 20% of people who are referred to foodbanks in our network have someone at home who is in work.\n\n\"We are incredibly concerned about the year that lies ahead of us.\"\n\nMr Currie said local food banks are incredibly concerned about the year ahead\n\nMr Currie said the rising cost of food is affecting more people every day.\n\nOver the past year, the cost of living has soared.\n\nRising prices for bread, cereal and chocolate, for example, have helped push food prices to a 45-year high.\n\nMr Currie said the main reasons most people were referred to local food banks was because their income was not enough to meet the essentials, insecure work or a sudden life event that has affected them financially.\n\n\"The most pressing issue is the cost of essentials is rising and that's pushing more and more people through our doors,\" he said.\n\n\"The challenge that we face as a food bank charity and for other providers of this type of crisis support is, it's simply not sustainable long term.\n\n\"Food banks shouldn't exist - we are glad that they do - but we want to ensure that people have ways of accessing an income so they can afford the essentials for themselves.\"\n\nA statement from Trussell Trust added: \"More than 26,000 people in Northern Ireland are using a Trussell Trust food bank for the first time - this is almost the same as the population of the town of Antrim.\"\n\nDecember 2022 was the busiest month on record in the region, with 12,262 parcels distributed.\n\nA parcel typically has food for one person for three days but it also provides parcels with food for one person for seven days.\n\nThe figures combine the provision of both types of parcel.\n\nOf the 81,084 emergency food parcels distributed in the past year, more than 35,000 were for children and almost 46,000 for adults\n\nThe trust has called for Universal Credit payments to rise to cover the cost of essentials such as food, heating and clothes.\n\nIt said that would reduce the need for people to use food banks.\n\nMr Currie said those most vulnerable needed a functioning government at Stormont to make decisions and create policies that affect those who are most disadvantaged.\n\n\"We really need a long-term plan that will address poverty. We need programmes that will put more money in people's pockets and we need a strong network of local services so that people can access support before having to turn to a food bank,\" he added.\n\nPrevious analysis has suggested that around one in four children in Northern Ireland are living in poverty.\n\nA scheme to provide payments to families on low incomes to help with the cost of food during school holidays was, however, recently axed by the Department of Education.", "Last updated on .From the section Cricket\n\nEngland's Stuart Broad has become just the second pace bowler to take 600 wickets in Test cricket.\n\nBroad, 36, reached the mark by removing Australia's Travis Head on day one of the fourth Ashes Test at Old Trafford.\n\nEngland team-mate James Anderson is the only other quick bowler to achieve the feat.\n\nBroad is fifth on the all-time list and Anderson third, with spinners Muttiah Muralitharan, Shane Warne and Anil Kumble completing the top five.\n\nNottinghamshire bowler Broad made his debut against Sri Lanka in Colombo 2007, going on to make 166 Test appearances to date and be part of four Ashes-winning sides.\n\nHe began the Old Trafford Test on 598 wickets but moved to 599 when he trapped Usman Khawaja lbw, before bringing up 600 when Head was caught by Joe Root on the boundary.\n\u2022 None How many of Broad's Test victims can you name?\n\n\"Never in my dreams did I think this would be a thing,\" Broad told BBC Sport.\n\n\"Michael Vaughan was the skipper that gave me my first cap and my ultimate feeling there in Sri Lanka was never that this was the end game but instead that I wanted to win series and create memories.\n\n\"Some players feel like they have achieved what they wanted to after getting a Test cap and I've been fortunate enough to create memories. Never did I think I would be up there with the greats of the game.\"\n\nIn taking his 600th scalp, Broad surpassed Ian Botham to become the highest wicket-taker from any nation against Australia, with 149.\n\nOnly Australians Shane Warne (195), Dennis Lillee (167) and Glenn McGrath (157) have taken more in Ashes Tests.\n\nBroad is known for his devastating spells of bowling that turn matches in England's favour, including famously at his home ground Trent Bridge in 2015 when he took 8-15 to bowl out Australia for 60.\n\nHe also took 5-5 in just 5.1 overs against India at the same ground in 2011, including his first Test match hat-trick as MS Dhoni, Harbhajan Singh and Praveen Kumar fell in successive deliveries.\n\nRank these five magic spells of Stuart Broad bowling.\n\nBroad, who is the son of former England batter Chris, is also well known for the hold he seemingly has over David Warner, having dismissed the Australia opener 17 times during his career.\n\nOnly two other players have dismissed a single batter more in Test cricket.\n\nA second hat-trick against Sri Lanka in 2014 also means he is the only England bowler to take two Test hat-tricks.\n\u2022 None David Warner on the Ashes, sledging and Stuart Broad rivalry\n\nBroad has also played 121 one-day internationals and 56 T20s in his career.

The Bank, which is the UK's central bank, is charged with setting interest rates and in response to the inflation rate going up in recent times, its officials have increased interest rates - which make the cost of borrowing money more expensive for people and businesses.\n\nThis strategy, in theory, is meant to make people spend less so that demand for goods reduces and prices slow down or even fall.\n\nBut with the strain of rising prices being felt by households trying to pay higher energy bills and food costs, many people have asked for pay rises to help ease the cost of living.\n\nPeople working across several industries, such as rail, the NHS and the civil service, have gone on strike in recent months over various reasons including pay.\n\nAnd with job vacancies still being higher than they have been in previous years, workers have had a stronger hand in asking their employers for more money.\n\nMr Pill, who made \u00a395,183, including benefits, in his first six months at the Bank, is paid more than \u00a3190,000 a year.\n\nHe told the Beyond Unprecedented podcast from Columbia Law School that people demanding higher pay and businesses passing on increased costs by putting prices up, added to inflation and caused prices to rise even further across the economy.\n\nHe said what the UK imports from other countries, such as natural gas, was costing a lot more than what it exports.\n\n\"You don't need to be much of an economist to realise that if what you're buying has gone up a lot relative to what you're selling, you're going to be worse off,\" he said.\n\n\"Somehow in the UK, someone needs to accept that they're worse off and stop trying to maintain their real spending power by bidding up prices, whether through higher wages or passing energy costs on to customers.\"\n\nHe added: \"What we're facing now is that reluctance to accept that. That pass-the-parcel game that's going on here, that game is one that's generating inflation, and that part of inflation can persist.\"\n\nHuw Pill is the chief economist at the Bank of England\n\nThomas Moore, senior investment director at Abrdn, told BBC 5Live Mr Pill's words \"need to accept\" were a \"red rag to the bull\".\n\nBut he added: \"You can see that underlying all of this, he has got a point which is as long as inflation stays high, we are going to demand higher wages and as long as we demand higher wages, inflation is going to stay high.\"\n\nBut although pay has been going up, it has not matched inflation, meaning people are worse off.\n\nThere have been arguments by some economists that employers giving out large pay rises could spark a \"wage-price\" spiral, when pay increases help force prices up and high inflation lasts for a longer time.", "The car crashed into the school at about 10:00 BST on Thursday\n\nPolice are continuing to question a woman over a car crash at a school which killed an eight-year-old girl, as floral tributes are laid at the scene.\n\nTwelve people were taken to hospital after a Land Rover crashed into The Study Preparatory School in Wimbledon.\n\nNone of the children injured on Thursday are in a critical condition, the chair of governors told the BBC.\n\nThe woman in her 40s remains in custody having been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving.\n\nOne line of inquiry is that the driver had a medical incident, the BBC understands.\n\nThe Met Police has removed the car from the site, in south-west London, as part of its investigation and the cordon has been lifted.

For example, they can narrow their face, change the shape and size of their eyes, or give themselves a digital nose-job.\n\nOriginally only able to work on photos, two years ago FaceTune launched a version for short selfie videos that has increasingly grown in its effectiveness since then.\n\nFaceTune was one of the first firms in the sector to extend its app from still images to videos\n\nMeanwhile, another popular app that allows users to alter their social media photos - Perfect365 - is due to launch its video version later this year.\n\nFaceTune is owned by Israeli-firm Lightricks and two years ago the company was reported to have a valuation of $1.8bn (\u00a31.4bn).\n\nLightricks' founder Zeev Farbman says that \"the name of the game\" is making the app work as easily as possible. \"You want to give people 80% of the power, with 20% of the complexity of professional software. That's the game we are trying to play.\"\n\nBut it has long been argued that such tools are unhealthy, in that they promote an unrealistic view of beauty that can be dangerous, particularly for impressionable children and young adults. For example, 80% of teenage girls said they had changed their appearance in an online photo by the age of 13, according to a 2021 survey by skincare brand Dove.\n\nWhile no-one is calling for the tech to be banned, there have been increasing moves to force social media advertisers and influencers - people who are often being paid to promote products in a more informal way - to admit when they have altered their physical image.\n\nShould governments regulate the use of social media photo and video manipulation?\n\nNorway introduced a law in 2021 that requires these two social media groups to indicate whether a photograph has been retouched. France is now going one stage further, and is in the process of demanding the same requirement, but for both photos and videos.\n\nMeanwhile, the UK is now looking at the same issue, as the government's Online Safety Bill continues to make its way through Parliament. However, it remains to be seen whether the law will target just adverts on social media, or influencers as well.\n\nA spokesperson for the new Department for Science, Innovation and Technology said: \"The government recognises the threat that digitally manipulated content can pose, and takes the issue very seriously.\"\n\nConservative MP Luke Evans has long campaigned for advertisers and influencers to admit when they have altered an image on social media.\n\nHe wants to see the new law \"contain future proofed regulation\", so it also requires the same admission for altered videos, and any other tech developments.\n\n\"It's imperative that we have wider awareness and increased transparency surrounding these new technologies,\" he says. \"For me this is all about honesty.\"\n\nNew Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.\n\nMr Farbman's response is that while \"this conversation was always there... over time the acceptance of these tools just grows\". He adds that it is a free speech issue. \"It's always kind of weird to me that a company will decide to limit the expressive freedom of its users, because of aesthetic or ethical sensibilities.\"\n\nSean Mao, the chief executive of San Francisco-based Perfect365, urges people to use its app \"in a safe and ethical way\". He adds: \"We encourage people to use the app to express their creativity and not to use the app with malicious intent to deceive others or misrepresent themselves.\"\n\nPsychologist Stuart Duff, a partner at UK practice Pearn Kandola, says that some social media influencers will always be tempted to use tricks to improve their online appearance - because being good-looking sells.\n\n\"Physical attraction has a very strong but often unconscious influence on our decisions when it comes to buying products and services from others,\" he says.\n\n\"When asked what matters most, we consciously talk down the importance of physical appearance and talk up qualities such as intelligence, values and personality, yet psychological research consistently reveals a strong positive relationship between a person's attractiveness and their ability to sell to us.\"\n\nOne social media influencer who goes by the name of Brandon B has 5.6 million subscribers on YouTube. He takes the view that photo and video manipulation apps should be seen in a positive light.\n\nSocial media influencer Brandon B says that image manipulation apps can give some people increased confidence\n\n\"I'm glad these apps exist, because I think there are a lot of people who are not body positive enough to present on social media, so they might feel left out,\" he says. \"These tools help them get on social media.\"\n\nHowever, Dr Shira Brown, an emergency physician at South Niagara Hospital, in Ontario, Canada, says that \"distorted perceptions of body image\" appear to be being \"exacerbated by common social media practices\".\n\nShe adds: \"We see the urgent mental health consequences of social media in our departments on a daily basis, such as anxiety, suicidal thoughts, and depression.\"", "\"I myself am a boomer! I'm, like, horrible!\"\n\nThere's something a bit unexpected about one of the most famous people on the planet using what's become a term of abuse about themselves instead of choreographed gushing about their latest project.\n\nBut Arnold Schwarzenegger's path in life has been unexpected, and unprecedented: celebrity bodybuilder; Hollywood action hero; Republican Party governor of California; climate campaigner.\n\nTechnically, he is indeed one of the post-war generation - the baby boomers, much mocked for not moving with the times.\n\nBut when we meet to talk at his glossy climate conference in Vienna where everything, including the hot dogs, is vegan, he teases himself to make a big point.\n\nPoliticians must move much faster, he believes, to preserve the planet for the generations to come. And Schwarzenegger's strong belief is that the technology exists to crack down on emissions but the \"boomers\" might miss the chance.\n\nThis is the man who - as governor of California - in 2006 enacted a landmark climate change bill, the California Global Warming Solutions Act, which established greenhouse gas emission targets for the state.\n\nHe told me: 'We have to change with the times. I would not want to drive, except maybe for fun, a car that is 50 years old.\n\n\"I don't want to make investments that were really cool 50 years ago - you would lose your shirt today if you made those investments. We have to change with the technology, it's as simple as that.\"\n\nAnd his message applies to environmental activists too, calling on campaigners not to try to block development as a solution to climate change, but to push for a different kind.\n\nHe said it's \"the same with the environmental movement, we have to get out of the mode of stopping every project from being built. We've got to go and build, build, build all these green projects.\" In other words, hurry up!\n\nHis challenge is exactly the question that's being put to our governments too. It's true the UK has had a decent record on renewable energy compared with other countries.\n\nEnergy Secretary Grant Shapps boasted last weekend that \"we're ahead of the game because of the level of renewables that we've got coming into our system right now\".\n\nBut there is anxiety about that progress stalling, just when the scale of what's needed becomes clear.\n\nOnly two onshore wind turbines were built in England last year, for example.\n\nThe number of heat pumps that are being installed is woefully behind its ambition - the target is for 600,000 low-carbon heat pumps to be installed every year within five years; currently it's only 50,000 - less than 10%.\n\nJust this week the world's fourth-biggest auto manufacturer Stellantis said the government's post-Brexit trade deal needed to change, otherwise it would have to reconsider building electric cars here.\n\nThe boss of the battery firm that went bust, Britishvolt, claimed the government foot-dragging was partly to blame for it going under - although that was denied by ministers.\n\nAnd National Grid, not exactly prone to hyperbole, said \"unprecedented\" and \"transformative\" change was needed right now.\n\nThe statistics they published this week about what's needed by 2030 illustrate that in a pretty jaw-dropping way. They calculate the UK needs:\n\nLabour's shadow climate change secretary Ed Miliband accuses the government of a \"failure of ambition and action\" when it comes to clean power.\n\n\"The planning ban on onshore wind alone is costing \u00a3180 for every family, and a government asleep at the wheel has allowed grid delays to grow to more than a decade,\" he says.\n\nLabour, he promises, will lift the ban on onshore wind generation and \"be builders, not blockers, for the clean power we need\".\n\nAnd when you talk to industry insiders, the frustration with the government's pace is obvious.\n\nOne source told me that \"the government isn't accelerating - it's not doing much more than was agreed at Carbis Bay\" - an international summit two years ago - even though the need is becoming more and more obvious and the conflict in Ukraine has made reliance on fossil fuels precarious in a different way.\n\nAnother, frustrated with the difference between the government's rhetoric and reality, told me Grant Shapps was \"all hat, no cattle\".\n\nThe differences are more obvious as the US has introduced an enormous plan for subsiding firms moving to use or produce green energy, the Inflation Reduction Act. And the EU has brought in its Net Zero Industry Act.\n\nFor now, the UK government is taking a very different approach.\n\nChancellor Jeremy Hunt and Chancellor-turned-Prime Minister Rishi Sunak are instinctively, and politically, not fans of that kind of intervention. Although when it comes to specific cases, they may still be prepared to act.\n\nIn fact, there are suggestions that Jeremy Hunt has offered cash incentives to Tata, the owner of Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), to build a gigafactory for electric car batteries here.

She and her mother were buried beneath rubble after a rocket exploded near their home.\n\nHer mother was taken to intensive care, Mr Lysak said, along with three boys aged six, 11 and 15, all of whom have multiple injuries, concussions and fractures. The boys are now said to be \"on the mend\".\n\nExplosions have also been heard over the capital, Kyiv, where air defence systems have again been deployed.

Its discussions suggested that some of that pressure, for example from wage growth, was declining even after yesterday's shock inflation number.\n\nThe Bank's governor, Andrew Bailey, confirmed that he had seen private wage growth begin to \"even off\", which was \"obviously a good sign in terms of inflationary pressure\".\n\nThe next Bank meeting in May is now a key point, where new quarterly forecasts for the economy and inflation could underpin a pause in rate rises.\n\nWhile the British economy is better than feared, with a predicted recession now anticipated to be swerved, there are concerns about the impact of global financial fragility. The UK remains resilient. Mr Bailey told broadcasters that \"this is not a repeat of 2008\". But that is another cloud weighing over the Bank's decisions, with some memories of the quickly-reversed rises made by the Bank, even after the credit crunch started in 2007.\n\nThere's a three-way balancing act going on right now between surprisingly strong double-digit UK inflation, stagnant growth and the fragility in the global banking system which, while not centred in the UK, could have knock-on impacts on the funding of banks.\n\nAbsent that new cloud however, there is some good news about the UK economy here.\n\nThe consumer seems more resilient to what was an extraordinary energy shock.

All they need at the end is to hang on, rebuild, and go again.\n\n\"That's victory for Hamas; and that is what these legal experts seem to be asking for.\"\n\nMore than 600 lawyers, including former Supreme Court justices, this week wrote to the government saying weapon exports to Israel must end because the UK risks breaking international law over a \"plausible risk of genocide\" in Gaza. Israel rejects the claim of genocide as \"wholly unfounded\".\n\nThree Britons were among the World Central Kitchen (WCK) workers who died in the strikes: John Chapman, 57, James \"Jim\" Henderson, 33, and James Kirby, 47.\n\nWCK founder Jose Andres claimed the Israeli military knew of his aid workers' movements and targeted them \"systematically, car by car\".\n\nIsraeli officials reacted by sacking two senior military officers over the strikes, which it has described as a \"grave mistake stemming from a serious failure\".\n\nMr Johnson said it was \"shattering\" to see the deaths, but Israel was sending warnings of their attacks and \"trying to use precision munitions\".\n\nForeign Secretary Lord David Cameron previously said the UK would carefully review findings of the initial Israel Defense Forces (IDF) report into the incident, which was released on Friday.\n\nMr Johnson accused Lord Cameron of being silent on the issue, saying the foreign secretary had \"gone into a kind of purdah\" on arms sales.\n\nMuch of the Gaza Strip has been devastated during the IDF military operations which began after Hamas gunmen attacked southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and seizing 253 hostages.\n\nMore than 33,137 people have been killed in Gaza since then, with 75,815 injured, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\n\nReacting to Mr Johnson's comments, a UK Foreign Office spokesman said: \"We keep advice on Israel's adherence to international humanitarian law under review and ministers act in accordance with that advice, for example when considering export licences.\n\n\"The content of the government's advice is confidential.\n\n\"Decisions on export licences are based on the Strategic Export Licensing Criteria.

So for example, one oyster on its own can accommodate over 100 species on its shell. So if you have a reef of oysters, you can imagine the sort of life that that'll attract.\"\n\nDave Smyth said they want to save the habitat as much as the oysters\n\nMid and East Antrim Council manages the marina where the nursery has been installed and its mayor, Alderman Noel Williams of the Alliance Party, welcomed the project.\n\n\"We are thrilled to be playing our part in restoring this endangered native species.\n\n\"Nestled at the bottom of the Glens of Antrim, Glenarm Marina is the perfect spot to help revive native oysters.\n\n\"As well as increasing water clarity and quality, the project will also deliver enhanced biodiversity and provide rich cultural value to the area,\" he added.\n\nChildren from Seaview Integrated Primary School in Glenarm helped measure the oysters\n\nNative oysters are one of the most imperilled habitats on Earth. It is estimated that reefs have declined by 95% since the 19th century.\n\nWith each oyster potentially filtering as much as eight litres of water an hour, they also improve water quality and are something of an environmental odd-jobs worker.\n\n\"They have a lot of other additional ecosystem services whereby they can change or fix things within the environment,\" said Dave Smyth.\n\n\"One example is, they can actually filter microplastics out over their gills. They'll expel those wrapped in a mucus ball which will end up locked up into the sediment of the seabed.\n\n\"This is a win-win for nature, restoring oysters creates healthier and more resilient seas and their reefs store carbon - crucial if we are to tackle the nature and climate crisis,\" he added.\n\nThe children examined the oysters using a microscope", "The captain dimmed the lights in the cabin to enhance the view\n\nAn EasyJet pilot made a 360-degree turn to treat passengers to a stunning view of the northern lights.\n\nThe plane was travelling from Iceland to Manchester as the aurora borealis lit up skies across the UK in a rare display.\n\nPassenger Adam Groves, of Lymm, Cheshire, said the \"incredible\" sight \"topped off\" his four-night trip, which also saw him get engaged.\n\nIt came as the country enjoyed a second night of spectacular views.\n\nMr Groves said he and his fiancee Jasmine Mapp were on the right-hand side of the plane, which took off from Reykjavik, and would not have been able to see the lights if it was not for the \"very kind\" pilot.\n\nThe pair had actually spent their entire trip in Iceland hunting the aurora without success.\n\nThe UK enjoyed a second night of spectacular views of the lights on Monday evening\n\nMr Groves said: \"We were hoping to see them while we were out there but we didn't get the chance.\n\n\"We took off and halfway into the flight the pilot turned all the lights off and the view could be seen out the left window.\n\n\"But we were sitting on the right-hand side and after a few minutes the pilot switched back and did a 360 loop around for everyone to see.\"\n\nAdam Groves proposed to girlfriend Jasmine Mapp during their trip to Iceland\n\nThe experience topped off a whirlwind trip for the couple, Mr Groves said, as his girlfriend accepted his marriage proposal at a beauty spot on the island's south coast.\n\nMs Mapp said: \"After days of jumping in the car at any opportunity to try and find the northern lights without spotting them, finally getting to see them in the sky was the perfect ending to a very special trip.\"\n\nAn EasyJet spokeswoman said: \"We are pleased that the captain was able to perform a controlled manoeuvre in order to allow passengers to witness an amazing display from the air of one of nature's greatest sights.\n\n\"Our crew will always go above and beyond for our customers and we're delighted to have been able to share this special view with them.\"\n\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

It will make it illegal for app stores to offer TikTok, but does not ban people who already have TikTok from using it.\n\nMontana, which has a population of just over one million, banned the app on government devices last December.\n\nTikTok says it has 150 million American users. Although the app's user base has expanded in recent years, it is still most popular with teenagers and users in their 20s.\n\nHowever, there are concerns across the US political spectrum that TikTok could be a national security risk.\n\nThe social media platform is owned by ByteDance - a Chinese company. ByteDance has repeatedly denied it is controlled by the Chinese government.\n\nThe lawsuit also argues that Montana has overstepped its authority by concerning itself with users' data and national security - which is the purview of the federal government.\n\nIt says the ban is based on the \"unfounded speculation\" that China's government could access TikTok data.\n\nLawyers for Montana's government have previously said that they expected lawsuits, and that they are prepared to defend the ban in courts.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

for which we sincerely apologised - those concerns were rigorously investigated in 2022, and a further review was conducted by our director of nursing following concerns raised to the new CEO.\n\n\"Over the past year, we have strengthened our processes around complaints and incidents, and the learnings from the review have played an important role in that.\n\n\"While there was no evidence of any racial discrimination towards Mr Ndhlovu during his treatment, we take any accusation of prejudice in our practices extremely seriously and will always fully investigate concerns raised.\"\n\nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Nicola Sturgeon has said the interests of the SNP are \u201cas close to my heart as is possible\u201d.\n\nNicola Sturgeon has returned to the Scottish Parliament for the first time since being arrested as part of an investigation into SNP finances.\n\nThe former first minister was released without charge after being questioned by Police Scotland for more than seven hours last week.\n\nShe told reporters at Holyrood that she is \"absolutely certain\" she has done nothing wrong.\n\nShe also indicated she would not resign from the SNP.\n\nMs Sturgeon, who stood down as both party leader and first minister in March, said the party had been her life and she would always act in its best interests.\n\nShe said: \"I'm back in parliament today getting on with my job representing my constituents.\"\n\nThe former first minister told reporters she was \"heavily constrained\" on what she could say about the police investigation, adding: \"I respect and understand the process that is under way, but I am absolutely certain that I have done nothing wrong.\"\n\nQuestioned on whether she should stand down from the SNP, she said she would always consider what is best for the party.\n\nMs Sturgeon said it had not been an \"easy\" period in her life. \"The thing that sustains me right now is the certainty that I have done nothing wrong,\" she told reporters.\n\nThe former first minister also insisted that the investigation had not \"shaken\" her belief that the case for Scottish independence was getting \"stronger every day\".\n\nHer successor, Humza Yousaf, has been under pressure from opposition parties and some within the SNP to suspend Ms Sturgeon while the police investigation is ongoing.\n\nFirst Minister Humza Yousaf has rejected calls to suspend Nicola Sturgeon from the SNP\n\nAfter her arrest and subsequent release he described Ms Sturgeon as being \"the most impressive politician I think we have seen in Europe\" and described her as \"an asset to our movement, and to our party\".\n\nSNP MSPs also agreed to send flowers to the former first minister \"as an expression of our support\" after a group meeting at Holyrood last week.\n\nMs Sturgeon spoke to reporters outside her home in Glasgow on Sunday - the first time she had been seen in public since her arrest on 11 June.\n\nShortly after being released from custody pending further investigations she released a statement on social media which stated she would \"never do anything to harm either the SNP or the country\".\n\nHer latest statement came after a Panelbase poll for the Sunday Times suggested that Labour could be on track to win more seats than the SNP in a Westminster election for the first time since 2010, with Mr Yousaf's party projected to go from 45 seats to 21.\n\nThe poll, conducted in the days after Ms Sturgeon's arrest, also suggested that her personal approval rating has fallen by 38 points since February, from plus 20 to minus 18.\n\nPolice Scotland's investigation, named Operation Branchform, is looking into what happened to more than \u00a3600,000 of donations given to the SNP by independence activists.\n\nOfficers searched Ms Sturgeon's home and the SNP's headquarters in Edinburgh on 5 April.\n\nFormer SNP chief executive Peter Murrell, who is also Ms Sturgeon's husband, was arrested and released without charge pending further investigation.\n\nA luxury motorhome which costs about \u00a3110,000 was also seized by police from outside the home of Mr Murrell's mother in Dunfermline.\n\nAlmost two weeks later, SNP treasurer Colin Beattie was arrested and released without charge while further inquiries were carried out.\n\nMs Sturgeon, Mr Murrell and Mr Beattie were the three signatories on the SNP's accounts and the arrest of the former first minister had been widely expected.\n\nMs Sturgeon has previously denied that her decision to resign as first minister and SNP leader earlier this year was influenced by the police investigation.\n\nScottish Conservative chairman Craig Hoy MSP said: \"While the former first minister was adamant she was innocent of wrongdoing in the SNP finances scandal, she pointedly refused to give any such assurances on behalf of Peter Murrell.\n\n\"Michelle Thomson is rightly annoyed that she was forced to give up the SNP whip by her then-leader Nicola Sturgeon, who is now refusing to follow her own precedent.\n\n\"But rather than apologise to her colleague, Nicola Sturgeon would only say she understood her anger, which will be cold comfort to those suspended under her leadership.\"", "A network of sensors provides real-time information on changes in water quality\n\nArtificial intelligence will be used in south-west England to predict pollution before it happens and help prevent it.\n\nIt's hoped the pilot project in Devon will help improve water quality at the seaside resort of Combe Martin, making it a better place for swimming.\n\nSensors placed in rivers and fields will build a picture of the state of local rivers, rainfall and soil.\n\nAI will then combine that data with satellite imagery of local land use.\n\nIt will predict when the local river system is most vulnerable to things like agricultural runoff, allowing for measures such as asking farms to hold off on applying fertiliser.\n\nComputer systems company CGI is running the artificial intelligence project with mapping experts Ordnance Survey. CGI said it was more than 90% accurate during a test run.\n\nIt's being trialled in what's known as the North Devon Biosphere Reserve, a 55-sq-mile (142-sq-km) protected area that includes important natural habitats as well as farmland and small towns.\n\n\"We'll give (the AI) the history,\" said CGI's chief sustainability officer Mattie Yeta. \"We'll give it all of the geographic information, as well as data sets from the sensors for it to learn and develop the predictive mechanisms to be able to inform where these incidents are occurring and indeed when they will take place.\"\n\nThe green lined River Umber brings pollution into the sea at Combe Martin\n\nIt's hoped the project could clean up the seaside resort town of Combe Martin, where the quality of bathing water has long been a concern.\n\n\"It's always been bumping along the bottom in terms of water quality,\" says Andy Bell from the North Devon Biosphere Reserve.\n\nThough the water at Combe Martin was last year rated by the Environment Agency as 'good', Mr Bell says that was mainly down to dry weather. More typical years, he says, were 2018 and 2019 when it received a 'poor' rating, which meant a notice being posted advising people not to swim.\n\n\"There is very much a fear in the community of what would happen if the bathing water status was rescinded.\" Andy says\n\n\"It would impact on the cafes, the restaurants, the B&B's\u2026 people want to come to a clean place to enjoy themselves.\"\n\nThe River Umber is the main culprit, according to Mr Bell. It reaches the sea through a corridor of lush green algae on the edge of the beach. The Umber is usually little more than a stream but it receives discharges both from a sewage treatment plant and agricultural runoff from farms.\n\nCleaning up the Umber is seen as a first step towards improving the water quality on the beach and the key to that, according to the artificial intelligence project, is a huge amount of real-time information.\n\nFloating water sensors monitor key indicators and send back information over mobile and wifi networks\n\nA couple of kilometres upstream from Combe Martin beach, a floating water sensor is being installed in the river. It's a square black box with solar panels on top and is moored by a cable to the bank.\n\nIt automatically transmits a stream of data on six key indicators of water health including acidity (pH), ammonia, the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water and how clear the water is (turbidity).\n\n\"It's a really good overview of water quality,\" said Glyn Cotton, the chief executive of environment-focussed technology company Watr, which is supplying the \u00a32,000-a-go ($2,557) sensors to the project.\n\n\"If sewage was being discharged upstream we would see spikes in things like ammonia and pH and we can then cross-reference that with temperature and dissolved oxygen levels.\"\n\nAbout 50 connected sensors are being used across the catchment area, a mix of water, soil and rain gauges. Mapping company Ordnance Survey are providing the expertise to integrate that information with location specific data and satellite imagery.\n\nMapping experts Ordnance Survey are helping integrate the sensors with satellite imagery in the AI model\n\n\"We can start training the model using data to get it understanding that when there was a pollution event - whether it was associated with a particular area?\" said Donna Lyndsay from Ordnance Survey. \"Was there for example a particular rainfall event that washed it all off?\"\n\nThe hope is that the AI might, for example, advise a farmer to stop putting more fertiliser on his field, if the soil is dry and heavy rain forecast because of the likelihood of it being washed into the waterways.\n\nPreventing raw sewage being discharged by water treatment plants - a practice allowed when heavy rainfall overwhelms facilities - is more complicated. The AI might see it coming after heavy rainfall but that doesn't mean the water company has the capacity to stopped it being released.\n\nThe first phase of the AI project was a desk-based model using historic data, with CGI saying it predicted pollution events with 91.5% accuracy. Now the AI model is being unleashed 'in the wild' and the question is whether it can do the same.\n\n\"We're starting very small here (in North Devon) \u2026 but the idea is very much to scale up and roll this out to different parts of the UK.\" said CGI's Mattie Yeta.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) technology is developing fast, and transforming many aspects of life.

It is the most powerful fluctuation in the climate system anywhere on Earth.\n\nIn June, scientists declared that El Ni\u00f1o conditions were present.

She was not involved in the research.\n\n\"What makes this assessment different is that it takes real people's diets and is based on the various production methods we have at the moment,\" she said. \"The researchers have assessed at a much more granular level than has been done before the environmental footprint of what they are eating.\"\n\nThe research shows that a big meat-eater's diet produces an average of 10.24 kg of planet-warming greenhouse gasses each day. A low meat-eater produces almost half that at 5.37 kg per day. And for vegan diets - it's halved again to 2.47 kg a day.\n\nThe analysis is the first to look at the detailed impact of diets on other environmental measures all together. These are land use, water use, water pollution and loss of species, usually caused by loss of habitat because of expansion of farming. In all cases high meat-eaters had a significantly higher adverse impact than other groups.\n\nBritain has some of the most sustainable methods of meat production. And the sector employs nearly 100,000 people making \u00a39.5bn a year for the UK.\n\nNick Allen, CEO of the British Meat Processors Association says that such assessments were incomplete.\n\n''One of the frustrations with a report like this is that it looks just at the emissions from livestock production. It doesn't take into account that carbon gets absorbed into the grassland, trees and hedgerows [on farms]. If they took those sums into account you would probably have a different picture,'' he said.\n\nIn response Prof Scarborough said that a number of studies, including this one, had concluded that the taking up of CO2 by grasslands only have a ''modest impact''.\n\nA separate study also published in Nature Food in 2021 concluded that food production was responsible for a third of all global greenhouse gas emissions. And an independent review for the Department for the Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) called for a 30% reduction in meat consumption by 2032 in order to meet the UK's net zero target.\n\nBut according to Prof Jebb, little has been done to achieve this aim.\n\n\"In the UK it is still not accepted that we are eating an amount of meat which is inconsistent with our environmental goals. At the moment, the conversation is not how we are going to do this, but whether it is really necessary,\" she said.\n\n\"In the case of obesity people know they shouldn't be eating confectionary cakes and biscuits. They may not want to hear it, but they know it to be true. With meat they are not wholly convinced.\"\n\nShe adds that as well as encouraging people to change their diets, the government also needs to support farmers through the transition, by protecting their livelihoods.\n\n\"Our farmers are trying pretty hard to be sustainable, more so than in many other countries, and yet we in the UK are putting... more pressure on our farmers to change, and that is pretty tough if you are a farmer,\" she said.\n\nIn response a Defra spokesperson said ''people should make their own decisions around the food they eat\".\n\n\"Achieving the net zero target is a priority for this government, and whilst food choices can have an impact on greenhouse gas emissions, well-managed livestock also provide environmental benefits such as supporting biodiversity, protecting the character of the countryside and generating important income for rural communities.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board said ''AHDB is disappointed to see, once again, a study conveying simplistic conclusions to a very complex topic. Foods fulfil different roles within our diets and therefore cannot be fairly compared by weight, calorie or even nutrient contribution.
