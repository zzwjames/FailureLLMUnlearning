["Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\n\u3000\u3000by J.K. Rowling\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER ONE\n\u3000\u3000OWL POST\n\u3000\u3000Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways. For one thing, he hated the summer holidays more than any other time of year. For another, he really wanted to do his homework but was forced to do it in secret, in the dead of night. And he also happened to be a wizard.\n\u3000\u3000It was nearly midnight, and he was lying on his stomach in bed, the blankets drawn right over his head like a tent, a flashlight in one hand and a large leather-bound book (A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot) propped open against the pillow. Harry moved the tip of his eagle-feather quill down the page, frowning as he looked for something that would help him write his essay, \"Witch Burning in the Fourteenth Century Was Completely Pointless discuss.\"\n\u3000\u3000The quill paused at the top of a likely-looking paragraph. Harry Pushed his round glasses up the bridge of his nose, moved his flashlight closer to the book, and read:\n\u3000\u3000Non-magic people (more commonly known as Muggles) were particularly afraid of magic in medieval times, but not very good at recognizing it. On the rare occasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard, burning had no effect whatsoever. The witch or wizard would perform a basic Flame Freezing Charm and then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoying a gentle, tickling sensation. Indeed, Wendelin the Weird enjoyed being burned so much that she allowed herself to be caught no less than fortyseven times in various disguises.\n\u3000\u3000Harry put his quill between his teeth and reached underneath his pillow for his ink bottle and a roll of parchment. Slowly and very carefully he unscrewed the ink bottle, dipped his quill into it, and began to write, pausing every now and then to listen, because if any of the Dursleys heard the scratching of his quill on their way to the bathroom, he'd probably find himself locked in the cupboard under the stairs for the rest of the summer.\n\u3000\u3000The Dursley family of number four, Privet Drive, was the reason that Harry never enjoyed his summer holidays. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and their son, Dudley, were Harry's only living relatives. They were Muggles, and they had a very medieval attitude toward magic. Harry's dead parents, who had been a witch and wizard themselves, were never mentioned under the Dursleys' roof For years, Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had hoped that if they kept Harry as downtrodden as possible, they would be able to squash the magic out of him. To their fury, they had been unsuccessful. These days they lived in terror of anyone finding out that Harry had spent most of the last two years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The most they could do, however, was to lock away Harry's spellbooks, wand, cauldron, and broomstick at the start of the summer break, and forbid him to talk to the neighbors.\n\u3000\u3000This separation from his spellbooks had been a real problem for Harry, because his teachers at Hogwarts had given him a lot of holiday work. One of the essays, a particularly nasty one about shrinking potions, was for Harry's least favorite teacher, Professor Snape, who would be delighted to have an excuse to give Harry detention for a month. Harry had therefore seized his chance in the first week of the holidays. While Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley had gone out into the front garden to admire Uncle Vernon's new company car (in very loud voices, so that the rest of the street would notice it too), Harry had crept downstairs, picked the lock on the cupboard under the stairs, grabbed some of his books, and hidden them in his bedroom. As long as he didn't leave spots of ink on the sheets, the Dursleys need never know that he was studying magic by night.\n\u3000\u3000Harry was particularly keen to avoid trouble with his aunt and uncle at the moment, as they were already in an especially bad mood with him, all because he'd received a telephone call from a fellow wizard one week into the school vacation.\n\u3000\u3000Ron Weasley, who was one of Harry's best friends at Hogwarts, came from a whole family of wizards. This meant that he knew a lot of things Harry didn't, but had never used a telephone before. Most unluckily, it had been Uncle Vernon who had answered the call.\n\u3000\u3000\"Vernon Dursley speaking.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry, who happened to be in the room at the time, froze as he heard Ron's voice answer.\n\u3000\u3000\"HELLO? HELLO? CAN YOU HEAR ME? I -- WANT -- TO -- TALK -- TO -- HARRY -- POTTER!\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron was yelling so loudly that Uncle Vernon jumped and held the receiver a foot away from his ear, staring at it with an expression of mingled fury and alarm.\n\u3000\u3000\"WHO IS THIS?\" he roared in the direction of the mouthpiece. \"WHO ARE YOU?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"RON -- WEASLEY!\" Ron bellowed back, as though he and Uncle Vernon were speaking from opposite ends of a football field. \"I'M -- A -- FRIEND -- OF -- HARRY'S -- FROM -- SCHOOL --\"\n\u3000\u3000Uncle Vernon's small eyes swiveled around to Harry, who was rooted to the spot.\n\u3000\u3000\"THERE IS NO HARRY POTTER HERE!\" he roared, now holding the receiver at arm's length, as though frightened it might explode. \"I DON'T KNOW WHAT SCHOOL YOURE TALKING ABOUT! NEVER CONTACT ME AGAIN! DON'T YOU COME NEAR MY FAMILY!\"\n\u3000\u3000And he threw the receiver back onto the telephone as if dropping a poisonous spider.\n\u3000\u3000The fight that had followed had been one of the worst ever.\n\u3000\u3000\"HOW DARE YOU GIVE THIS NUMBER TO PEOPLE LIKE -- PEOPLE LIKE YOU!\" Uncle Vernon had roared, spraying Harry with spit.\n\u3000\u3000Ron obviously realized that he'd gotten Harry into trouble, because he hadn't called again. Harry's other best friend from Hogwarts, Hermione Granger, hadn't been in touch either. Harry suspected that Ron had warned Hermione not to call, which was a pity, because Hermione, the cleverest witch in Harry's year, had Muggle parents, knew perfectly well how to use a telephone, and would probably have had enough sense not to say that she went to Hogwarts.\n\u3000\u3000So Harry had had no word from any of his wizarding friends for five long weeks, and this summer was turning out to be almost as bad as the last one. There was just one very small improvement -- after swearing that he wouldn't use her to send letters to any of his friends, Harry had been allowed to let his owl, Hedwig, out at night. Uncle Vernon had given in because of the racket Hedwig made if she was locked in her cage all the time.\n\u3000\u3000Harry finished writing about Wendelin the Weird and paused to listen again. The silence in the dark house was broken only by the distant, grunting snores of his enormous cousin, Dudley. It must be very late, Harry thought. His eyes were itching with tiredness. Perhaps he'd finish this essay tomorrow night....\n\u3000\u3000He replaced the top of the ink bottle; pulled an old pillowcase from under his bed; put the flashlight, A History of Magic, his essay, quill, and ink inside it; got out of bed; and hid the lot under a loose floorboard under his bed. Then he stood up, stretched, and checked the time on the luminous alarm clock on his bedside table.\n\u3000\u3000It was one o'clock in the morning. Harry's stomach gave a funny jolt. He had been thirteen years old, without realizing it, for a whole hour.\n\u3000\u3000Yet another unusual thing about Harry was how little he looked forward to his birthdays. He had never received a birthday card in his life. The Dursleys had completely ignored his last two birthdays, and he had no reason to suppose they would remember this one.\n\u3000\u3000Harry walked across the dark room, past Hedwig's large, empty cage, to the open window. He leaned on the sill, the cool night air pleasant on his face after a long time under the blankets. Hedwig had been absent for two nights now. Harry wasn't worried about her: she'd been gone this long before. But he hoped she'd be back soon -- she was the only living creature in this house who didn't flinch at the sight of him.\n\u3000\u3000Harry, though still rather small and skinny for his age, had grown a few inches over the last year. His jet-black hair, however, was just as it always had been -- stubbornly untidy, whatever he did to it. The eyes behind his glasses were bright green, and on his forehead, clearly visible through his hair, was a thin scar, shaped like a bolt of lightning.\n\u3000\u3000Of all the unusual things about Harry, this scar was the most extraordinary of all. It was not, as the Dursleys had pretended for ten years, a souvenir of the car crash that had killed Harry's parents, because Lily and James Potter had not died in a car crash. They had been murdered, murdered by the most feared Dark wizard for a hundred years, Lord Voldemort. Harry had escaped from the same attack with nothing more than a scar on his forehead, where Voldemort's curse, instead of killing him, had rebounded upon its originator. Barely alive, Voldemort had fled....\n\u3000\u3000But Harry had come face-to-face with him at Hogwarts. Remembering their last meeting as he stood at the dark window, Harry had to admit he was lucky even to have reached his thirteenth birthday.\n\u3000\u3000He scanned the starry sky for a sign of Hedwig, perhaps soaring\n\u3000\u3000back to him with a dead mouse dangling from her beak, expecting praise. Gazing absently over the rooftops, it was a few seconds before Harry realized what he was seeing.\n\u3000\u3000Silhouetted against the golden moon, and growing larger every moment, was a large, strangely lopsided creature, and it was flapping in Harry's direction. He stood quite still, watching it sink lower and lower. For a split second he hesitated, his hand on the window latch, wondering whether to slam it shut. But then the bizarre creature soared over one of the street lamps of Privet Drive, and Harry, realizing what it was, leapt aside.\n\u3000\u3000Through the window soared three owls, two of them holding up the third, which appeared to be unconscious. They landed with a soft flump on Harry's bed, and the middle owl, which was large and gray, keeled right over and lay motionless. There was a large package tied to its legs.\n\u3000\u3000Harry recognized the unconscious owl at once -- his name was Errol, and he belonged to the Weasley family. Harry dashed to the bed, untied the cords around Errol's legs, took off the parcel, and then carried Errol to Hedwig's cage. Errol opened one bleary eye, gave a feeble hoot of thanks, and began to gulp some water.\n\u3000\u3000Harry turned back to the remaining owls. One of them, the large snowy female, was his own Hedwig. She, too, was carrying a parcel and looked extremely pleased with herself. She gave Harry an affectionate nip with her beak as he removed her burden, then flew across the room to join Errol.\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't recognize the third owl, a handsome tawny one, but he knew at once where it had come from, because in addition to a third package, it was carrying a letter bearing the Hogwarts crest. When Harry relieved this owl of its burden, it ruffled its feathers importantly, stretched its wings, and took off through the window into the night.\n\u3000\u3000Harry sat down on his bed and grabbed Errol's package, ripped off the brown paper, and discovered a present wrapped in gold, and his first ever birthday card. Fingers trembling slightly, he opened the envelope. Two pieces of paper fell out -- a letter and a newspaper clipping.\n\u3000\u3000The clipping had clearly come out of the wizarding newspaper, the Daily Prophet, because the people in the black-and-white picture were moving. Harry picked up the clipping, smoothed it out, and read:\n\u3000\u3000MINISTRY OF MAGIC EMPLOYEE SCOOPS GRAND PRIZE\n\u3000\u3000Arthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office at the Ministry of Magic, has won the annual Daily Prophet Grand Prize Galleon Draw.\n\u3000\u3000A delighted Mr. Weasley told the Daily Prophet, \"We will be spending the gold on a summer holiday in Egypt, where our eldest son, Bill, works as a curse breaker for Gringotts Wizarding Bank.\"\n\u3000\u3000The Weasley family will be spending a month in Egypt, returning for the start of the new school year at Hogwarts, which five of the Weasley children currently attend.\n\u3000\u3000Harry scanned the moving photograph, and a grin spread across his face as he saw all nine of the Weasleys waving furiously at him, standing in front of a large pyramid. Plump little Mrs. Weasley; tail, balding Mr. Weasley; six sons; and one daughter, all (though the black-and-white picture didn't show it) with flaming-red hair. Right in the middle of the picture was Ron, tall and gangling, with his pet rat, Scabbers, on his shoulder and his arm around his little sister, Ginny.\n\u3000\u3000Harry couldn't think of anyone who deserved to win a large pile of gold more than the Weasleys, who were very nice and extremely poor. He picked up Ron's letter and unfolded it.\n\u3000\u3000Dear Harry,\n\u3000\u3000Happy birthday!\n\u3000\u3000Look, I' really sorry about that telephone call. I hope the Muggles didn't give you a hard time. I asked Dad, and he reckons I shouldn't have shouted.\n\u3000\u3000It's amazing here in Egypt. Bill's taken us around all the tombs and you wouldn't believe the curses those old Egyptian wizards put on them. Mum wouldn't let Ginny come in the last one. There were all these mutant skeletons in there, of Muggles who'd broken in and grown extra heads and stuff.\n\u3000\u3000I couldn't believe it when Dad won the Daily Prophet Draw. Seven hundred galleons! Most of it's gone on this trip, but they're going to buy me a new wand for next year.\n\u3000\u3000Harry remembered only too well the occasion when Ron's old wand had snapped. It had happened when the car the two of them had been flying to Hogwarts had crashed into a tree on the school grounds.\n\u3000\u3000We'll be back about a week before term starts and we'll be going up to London to get my wand and our new books. Any chance of meeting you there?\n\u3000\u3000Don't let the Muggles get you down!\n\u3000\u3000Try and come to London,\n\u3000\u3000Ron\n\u3000\u3000P.S. Percy's Head Boy. He got the letter last week.\n\u3000\u3000Harry glanced back at the photograph. Percy, who was in his seventh and final year at Hogwarts, was looking particularly smug. He had pinned his Head Boy badge to the fez perched jauntily on top of his neat hair, his horn-rimmed glasses flashing in the Egyptian sun.\n\u3000\u3000Harry now turned to his present and unwrapped it. Inside was what looked like a miniature glass spinning top. There was another note from Ron beneath it.\n\u3000\u3000Harry -- this is a Pocket Sneakoscope. If there's someone untrustworthy around, it's supposed to light up and spin. Bill says it's rubbish sold for wizard tourists and isn't reliable, because it kept lighting up at dinner last night. But he didn't realize Fred and George had put beetles in his soup.\n\u3000\u3000Bye --\n\u3000\u3000Ron\n\u3000\u3000Harry put the Pocket Sneakoscope on his bedside table, where it stood quite still, balanced on its point, reflecting the luminous hands of his clock. He looked at it happily for a few seconds, then picked up the parcel Hedwig had brought.\n\u3000\u3000Inside this, too, there was a wrapped present, a card, and a letter, this time from Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000Dear Harry,\n\u3000\u3000Ron wrote to me and told me about his phone call to your Uncle Vernon. I do hope you're all right.\n\u3000\u3000I'm on holiday in France at the moment and I didn't know how I was going to send this to you -- what if they'd opened it at customs? -- but then Hedwig turned up! I think she wanted to make sure you got something for your birthday for a change. I bought your present by owl-order; there was an advertisement in the Daily Prophet (I've been getting it delivered; it's so good to keep up with what's going on in the wizarding world), Did you see that picture of Ron and his family a week ago? I bet he's learning loads. I'm really jealous -- the ancient Egyptian wizards were fascinating.\n\u3000\u3000There's some interesting local history of witchcraft here, too. I've rewritten my whole History of Magic essay to include some of the things I've found out, I hope it's not too long -- it's two rolls of parchment more than Professor Binns asked for.\n\u3000\u3000Ron says he's going to be in London in the last week of the holidays. Can you make it? Will your aunt and uncle let you come? I really hope you can. If not, I'll see you on the Hogwarts Express on September first!\n\u3000\u3000Love from Hermione\n\u3000\u3000P.S. Ron says Percy's Head Boy. I'll bet Percy's really pleased Ron doesn't seem too happy about it\n\u3000\u3000Harry laughed as he put Herrmone's letter aside and picked up her present. It was very heavy. Knowing Hermione, he was sure it would be a large book full of very difficult spells -- but it wasn't. His heart gave a huge bound as he ripped back the paper and saw a sleek black leather case, with silver words stamped across it, reading Broomstick Servicing Kit.\n\u3000\u3000\"Wow, Hermione!\" Harry whispered, unzipping the case to look inside.\n\u3000\u3000There was a large jar of Fleetwood's High-Finish Handle Polish, a pair of gleaming silver Tall-Twig Clippers, a tiny brass compass to clip on your broom for long journeys, and a Handbook of Do-It-Yourself Broomcare.\n\u3000\u3000Apart from his friends, the thing that Harry missed most about Hogwarts was Quidditch, the most popular sport in the magical world -- highly dangerous, very exciting, and played on broomsticks. Harry happened to be a very good Quidditch player; he had been the youngest person in a century to be picked for one of the Hogwarts House teams. One of Harry's most prized possessions was his Nimbus Two Thousand racing broom.\n\u3000\u3000Harry put the leather case aside and picked up his last parcel. He recognized the untidy scrawl on the brown paper at once: this was from Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper. He tore off the top layer of paper and glimpsed something green and leathery, but before he could unwrap it properly, the parcel gave a strange quiver, and whatever was inside it snapped loudly -- as though it had jaws.\n\u3000\u3000Harry froze. He knew that Hagrid would never send him anything dangerous on purpose, but then, Hagrid didn't have a normal person's view of what was dangerous. Hagrid had been known to befriend giant spiders, buy vicious, three-headed dogs from men in pubs, and sneak illegal dragon eggs into his cabin.\n\u3000\u3000Harry poked the parcel nervously. It snapped loudly again. Harry reached for the lamp on his bedside table, gripped it firmly in one hand, and raised it over his head, ready to strike. Then he seized the rest of the wrapping paper in his other hand and pulled.\n\u3000\u3000And out fell -- a book. Harry just had time to register its handsome green cover, emblazoned with the golden title The Monster Book of Monsters, before it flipped onto its edge and scuttled sideways along the bed like some weird crab.\n\u3000\u3000\"Uh-oh,\" Harry muttered.\n\u3000\u3000The book toppled off the bed with a loud clunk and shuffled rapidly across the room. Harry followed it stealthily. The book was hiding in the dark space under his desk. Praying that the Dursleys were still fast asleep, Harry got down on his hands and knees and reached toward it.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ouch!\"\n\u3000\u3000The book snapped shut on his hand and then flapped past him, still scuttling on its covers. Harry scrambled around, threw himself forward, and managed to flatten it. Uncle Vernon gave a loud, sleepy grunt in the room next door.\n\u3000\u3000Hedwig and Errol watched interestedly as Harry clamped the struggling book tightly in his arms, hurried to his chest of drawers, and pulled out a belt, which he buckled tightly around it. The Monster Book shuddered angrily, but could no longer flap and snap, so Harry threw it down on the bed and reached for Hagrid's card.\n\u3000\u3000Dear Harry,\n\u3000\u3000Happy Birthday!\n\u3000\u3000Think you might find this useful for next year. Won't say no more here. Tell you when I see you. Hope the Muggles are treating you right.\n\u3000\u3000All the best,\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid\n\u3000\u3000It struck Harry as ominous that Hagrid thought a biting book would come in useful, but he put Hagrid's card up next to Ron's and Hermione's, grinning more broadly than ever. Now there was only the letter from Hogwarts left.\n\u3000\u3000Noticing that it was rather thicker than usual, Harry slit open the envelope, pulled out the first page of parchment within, and read:\n\u3000\u3000Dear Mr. Potter,\n\u3000\u3000Please note that the new school year will begin on September the first. The Hogwarts Express will leave ftom King's Cross station, platform nine and three-quarters, at eleven o'clock.\n\u3000\u3000Third years are permitted to visit the village of Hogsmeade on certain weekends. Please give the enclosed permission form to your parent or guardian to sign.\n\u3000\u3000A list of books for next year is enclosed. Yours sincerely,\n\u3000\u3000Professor M. McGonagall\n\u3000\u3000Deputy Headmistress\n\u3000\u3000Harry pulled out the Hogsmeade permission form and looked at it, no longer grinning. It would be wonderful to visit Hogsmeade on weekends; he knew it was an entirely wizarding village, and he had never set foot there. But how on earth was he going to persuade Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia to sign the form?\n\u3000\u3000He looked over at the alarm clock. It was now two o'clock in the morning.\n\u3000\u3000Deciding that he'd worry about the Hogsmeade form when he woke up, Harry got back into bed and reached up to cross off another day on the chart he'd made for himself, counting down the days left until his return to Hogwarts. Then he took off his glasses and lay down, eyes open, facing his three birthday cards.\n\u3000\u3000Extremely unusual though he was, at that moment Harry Potter felt just like everyone else -- glad, for the first time in his life, that it was his birthday.\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER TWO\n\u3000\u3000AUNT MARGE'S BIG MISTAKE\n\u3000\u3000Harry went down to breakfast the next morning to find the three Dursleys already sitting around the kitchen table. They were watching a brand-new television, a welcome-home-for-the-summer present for Dudley, who had been complaining loudly about the long walk between the fridge and the television in the living room. Dudley had spent most of the summer in the kitchen, his piggy little eyes fixed on the screen and his five chins wobbling as he ate continually.\n\u3000\u3000Harry sat down between Dudley and Uncle Vernon, a large, beefy man with very little neck and a lot of mustache. Far from wishing Harry a happy birthday, none of the Dursleys made any sign that they had noticed Harry enter the room, but Harry was far too used to this to care. He helped himself to a piece of toast and then looked up at the reporter on the television, who was halfway through a report on an escaped convict:\n\u3000\u3000\"... The public is warned that Black is armed and extremely dangerous. A special hot line has been set up, and any sighting of Black should be reported immediately.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No need to tell us he's no good,\" snorted Uncle Vernon, staring over the top of his newspaper at the prisoner. \"Look at the state of him, the filthy layabout! Look at his hair!\"\n\u3000\u3000He shot a nasty look sideways at Harry, whose untidy hair had always been a source of great annoyance to Uncle Vernon. Compared to the man on the television, however, whose gaunt face was surrounded by a matted, elbow-length tangle, Harry felt very well groomed indeed.\n\u3000\u3000The reporter had reappeared.\n\u3000\u3000\"The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries will announce today --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hang on!\" barked Uncle Vernon, staring furiously at the reporter. \"You didn't tell us where that maniac's escaped from! \\What use is that? Lunatic could be coming up the street right now!\"\n\u3000\u3000Aunt Petunia, who was bony and horse-faced, whipped around and peered intently out of the kitchen window. Harry knew Aunt Petunia would simply love to be the one to call the hot line number. She was the nosiest woman in the world and spent most of her life spying on the boring, law-abiding neighbors.\n\u3000\u3000\"When will they learn,\" said Uncle Vernon, pounding the table with his large purple fist, \"that hanging's the only way to deal with these people?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Very true,\" said Aunt Petunia, who was still squinting into next door's runner beans.\n\u3000\u3000Uncle Vernon drained his teacup, glanced at his watch, and added, \"I'd better be off in a minute, Petunia. Marge's train gets in at ten.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry, whose thoughts had been upstairs with the Broomstick Servicing Kit, was brought back to earth with an unpleasant bump.\n\u3000\u3000\"Aunt Marge?\" he blurted out. \"Sh -- she's not coming here, is she?\"\n\u3000\u3000Aunt Marge was Uncle Vernon's sister. Even though she was not a blood relative of Harry's (whose mother had been Aunt Petunia's sister), he had been forced to call her \"Aunt\" all his life. Aunt Marge lived in the country, in a house with a large garden, where she bred bulldogs. She didn't often stay at Privet Drive, because she couldn't bear to leave her precious dogs, but each of her visits stood out horribly vividly in Harry's mind.\n\u3000\u3000At Dudley's fifth birthday party, Aunt Margo had whacked Harry around the shins with her walking stick to stop him from beating Dudley at musical statues. A few years later, she had turned up at Christmas with a computerized robot for Dudley and a box of dog biscuits for Harry. On her last visit, the year before Harry started at Hogwarts, Harry had accidentally trodden on the tail of her favorite dog. Ripper had chased Harry out into the garden and up a tree, and Aunt Marge had refused to call him off until past midnight. The memory of this incident still brought tears of laughter to Dudley's eyes.\n\u3000\u3000\"Marge'll be here for a week,\" Uncle Vernon snarled, 11 and while we're on the subject\" -- he pointed a fat finger threateningly at Harry -- \"we need to get a few things straight before I go and collect her.\"\n\u3000\u3000Dudley smirked and withdrew his gaze from the television. Watching Harry being bullied by Uncle Vernon was Dudley's favorite form of entertainment.\n\u3000\u3000\"Firstly,\" growled Uncle Vernon, \"you'll keep a civil tongue in your head when you're talking to Marge.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"All right,\" said Harry bitterly, \"if she does when she's talking to me.\n\u3000\u3000\"Secondly,\" said Uncle Vernon, acting as though he had not heard Harry's reply, \"as Marge doesn't know anything about your abnormality, I don't want any -- any funny stuff while she's here.\n\u3000\u3000You behave yourself, got me?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I will if she does,\" said Harry through gritted teeth.\n\u3000\u3000\"And thirdly,\" said Uncle Vernon, his mean little eyes now slits in his great purple face, \"we've told Marge you attend St. Brutus's Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" Harry yelled.\n\u3000\u3000\"And you'll be sticking to that story, boy, or there'll be trouble, spat Uncle Vernon.\n\u3000\u3000Harry sat there, white-faced and furious, staring at Uncle Vernon, hardly able to believe it. Aunt Marge coming for a weeklong visit -- it was the worst birthday present the Dursleys had ever given him, including that pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, Petunia,\" said Uncle Vernon, getting heavily to his feet, \"I'll be off to the station, then. Want to come along for the ride, Dudders?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Dudley, whose attention had returned to the television now that Uncle Vernon had finished threatening Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Duddy's got to make himself smart for his auntie,\" said Aunt Petunia, smoothing Dudley's thick blond hair. \"Mummy's bought him a lovely new bow tie.\"\n\u3000\u3000Uncle Vernon clapped Dudley on his porky shoulder. \"See you in a bit, then,\" he said, and he left the kitchen.\n\u3000\u3000Harry, who had been sitting in a kind of horrified trance, had a sudden idea. Abandoning his toast, he got quickly to his feet and followed Uncle Vernon to the front door.\n\u3000\u3000Uncle Vernon was pulling on his car coat.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm not taking you,\" he snarled as he turned to see Harry watching him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Like I wanted to come,\" said Harry coldly. \"I want to ask you something.\"\n\u3000\u3000Uncle Vernon eyed him suspiciously.\n\u3000\u3000\"Third years at Hog -- at my school are allowed to visit the village sometimes,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"So?\" snapped Uncle Vernon, taking his car keys from a hook next to the door.\n\u3000\u3000\"I need you to sign the permission form,\" said Harry in a rush.\n\u3000\u3000\"And why should I do that?\" sneered Uncle Vernon.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well,\" said Harry, choosing his words carefully, \"it'll be hard work, pretending to Aunt Marge I go to that St. Whatsits --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"St. Brutus's Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys!\" bellowed Uncle Vernon, and Harry was pleased to hear a definite note of panic in Uncle Vernon's voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"Exactly,\" said Harry, looking calmly up into Uncle Vernon's large, purple face. \"It's a lot to remember. I'll have to make it sound convincing, won't I? What if I accidentally let something slip?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You'll get the stuffing knocked out of you, won't you?\" roared Uncle Vernon, advancing on Harry with his fist raised. But Harry stood his ground.\n\u3000\u3000\"Knocking the stuffing out of me won't make Aunt Marge forget what I could tell her,\" he said grimly.\n\u3000\u3000Uncle Vernon stopped, his fist still raised, his face an ugly puce.\n\u3000\u3000\"But if you sign my permission form,\" Harry went on quickly, \"I swear I'll remember where I'm supposed to go to school, and I'll act like a Mug -- like I'm normal and everything.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry could tell that Uncle Vernon was thinking it over, even if his teeth were bared and a vein was throbbing in his temple.\n\u3000\u3000\"Right,\" he snapped finally. \"I shall monitor your behavior carefully during Marge's visit. If, at the end of it, you've toed the line and kept to the story, I'll sign your ruddy form.\"\n\u3000\u3000He wheeled around, pulled open the front door, and slammed it so hard that one of the little panes of glass at the top fell out.\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't return to the kitchen. He went back upstairs to his bedroom. If he was going to act like a real Muggle, he'd better start now. Slowly and sadly he gathered up all his presents and his birthday cards and hid them under the loose floorboard with his homework. Then he went to Hedwig's cage. Errol seemed to have recovered; he and Hedwig were both asleep, heads under their wings. Harry sighed, then poked them both awake.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hedwig,\" he said gloomily, \"you're going to have to clear off for a week. Go with Errol. Ron'll look after you. I'll write him a note, explaining. And don't look at me like that\" -- Hedwig's large amber eyes were reproachful -- \"it's not my fault. It's the only way I'll be allowed to visit Hogsmeade with Ron and Hermione.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ten minutes later, Errol and Hedwig (who had a note to Ron bound to her leg) soared out of the window and out of sight. Harry, now feeling thoroughly miserable, put the empty cage away inside the wardrobe.\n\u3000\u3000But Harry didn't have long to brood. In next to no time, Aunt Petunia was shrieking up the stairs for Harry to come down and get ready to welcome their guest.\n\u3000\u3000\"Do something about your hair!\" Aunt Petunia snapped as he reached the hall.\n\u3000\u3000Harry couldn't see the point of trying to make his hair lie flat. Aunt Marge loved criticizing him, so the untidier he looked, the happier she would be.\n\u3000\u3000All too soon, there was a crunch of gravel outside as Uncle Vernon's car pulled back into the driveway, then the clunk of the car doors and footsteps on the garden path.\n\u3000\u3000\"Get the door!\" Aunt Petunia hissed at Harry.\n\u3000\u3000A feeling of great gloom in his stomach, Harry pulled the door open.\n\u3000\u3000On the threshold stood Aunt Marge. She was very like Uncle Vernon: large, beefy, and purple- faced, she even had a mustache, though not as bushy as his. In one hand she held an enormous suitcase, and tucked under the other was an old and evil-tempered bulldog.\n\u3000\u3000\"Where's my Dudders?\" roared Aunt Marge. \"Where's my neffy-poo?\"\n\u3000\u3000Dudley came waddling down the hall, his blond hair plastered flat to his fat head, a bow tie just visible under his many chins. Aunt Marge thrust the suitcase into Harry's stomach, knocking the wind out of him, seized Dudley in a tight one-armed hug, and planted a large kiss on his cheek.\n\u3000\u3000Harry knew perfectly well that Dudley only put up with Aunt Marge's hugs because he was well paid for it, and sure enough, when they broke apart, Dudley had a crisp twenty-pound note clutched in his fat fist.\n\u3000\u3000\"Petunia!\" shouted Aunt Marge, striding past Harry as though he was a hat stand. Aunt Marge and Aunt Petunia kissed, or rather, Aunt Marge bumped her large jaw against Aunt Petunia's bony cheekbone.\n\u3000\u3000Uncle Vernon now came in, smiling jovially as he shut the door.\n\u3000\u3000\"Tea, Marge?\" he said. \"And what will Ripper take?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ripper can have some tea out of my saucer,\" said Aunt Marge as they all proceeded into the kitchen, leaving Harry alone in the hall with the suitcase. But Harry wasn't complaining; any excuse not to be with Aunt Marge was fine by him, so he began to heave the case upstairs into the spare bedroom, taking as long as he could.\n\u3000\u3000By the time he got back to the kitchen, Aunt Marge had been supplied with tea and fruitcake, and Ripper was lapping noisily in the corner. Harry saw Aunt Petunia wince slightly as specks of tea and drool flecked her clean floor. Aunt Petunia hated animals.\n\u3000\u3000\"Who's looking after the other dogs, Marge?\" Uncle Vernon asked.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, I've got Colonel Fubster managing them,\" boomed Aunt Marge. \"He's retired now, good for him to have something to do. But I couldn't leave poor old Ripper. He pines if he's away from me.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ripper began to growl again as Harry sat down. This directed Aunt Marge's attention to Harry for the first time.\n\u3000\u3000\"So!\" she barked. \"Still here, are you?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't you say yes' in that ungrateful tone,\" Aunt Marge growled. \"It's damn good of Vernon and Petunia to keep you. Wouldn't have done it myself. You'd have gone straight to an orphanage if you'd been dumped on my doorstep.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry was bursting to say that he'd rather live in an orphanage than with the Dursleys, but the thought of the Hogsmeade form stopped him. He forced his face into a painful smile.\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't you smirk at me!\" boomed Aunt Marge. \"I can see you haven't improved since I last saw you. I hoped school would knock some manners into you.\" She took a large gulp of tea, wiped her mustache, and said, \"Where is it that you send him, again, Vernon?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"St. Brutus's,\" said Uncle Vernon promptly. \"It's a first-rate institution for hopeless cases.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I see,\" said Aunt Marge. \"Do they use the cane at St. Brutus's, boy?\" she barked across the table.\n\u3000\u3000\"Er --\"\n\u3000\u3000Uncle Vernon nodded curtly behind Aunt Marge's back.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" said Harry. Then, feeling he might as well do the thing properly, he added, \"all the time.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Excellent,\" said Aunt Marge. \"I won't have this namby-pamby, wishy-washy nonsense about not hitting people who deserve it. A good thrashing is what's needed in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred. Have you been beaten often?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, yeah,\" said Harry, \"loads of times.\"\n\u3000\u3000Aunt Marge narrowed her eyes.\n\u3000\u3000\"I still don't like your tone, boy,\" she said. \"If you can speak of your beatings in that casual way, they clearly aren't hitting you hard enough. Petunia, I'd write if I were you. Make it clear that you approve the use of extreme force in this boy's case.\"\n\u3000\u3000Perhaps Uncle Vernon was worried that Harry might forget their bargain; in any case, he changed the subject abruptly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Heard the news this morning, Marge? What about that escaped prisoner, eh?\"\n\u3000\u3000As Aunt Marge started to make herself at home, Harry caught himself thinking almost longingly of life at number four without her. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia usually encouraged Harry to stay out of their way, which Harry was only too happy to do. Aunt Marge, on the other hand, wanted Harry under her eye at all times, so that she could boom out suggestions for his improvement. She delighted in comparing Harry with Dudley, and took huge pleasure in buying Dudley expensive presents while glaring at Harry, as though daring him to ask why he hadn't got a present too. She also kept throwing out dark hints about what made Harry such an unsatisfactory person.\n\u3000\u3000\"You mustn't blame yourself for the way the boy's turned out, Vernon,\" she said over lunch on the third day. \"If there's something rotten on the inside, there's nothing anyone can do about it.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry tried to concentrate on his food, but his hands shook and his face was starting to burn with anger. Remember the form, he told himself Think about Hogsmeade. Don't say anything. Don't rise\n\u3000\u3000Aunt Marge reached for her glass of wine.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's one of the basic rules of breeding,\" she said. \"You see it all the time with dogs. If there's something wrong with the bitch, there'll be something wrong with the pup --\"\n\u3000\u3000At that moment, the wineglass Aunt Marge was holding exploded in her hand. Shards of glass flew in every direction and Aunt Marge sputtered and blinked, her great ruddy face dripping.\n\u3000\u3000\"Marge!\" squealed Aunt Petunia. \"Marge, are you all right?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Not to worry,\" grunted Aunt Marge, mopping her face with her napkin. \"Must have squeezed it too hard. Did the same thing at Colonel Fubster's the other day. No need to fuss, Petunia, I have a very firm grip...\"\n\u3000\u3000But Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon were both looking at Harry suspiciously, so he decided he'd better skip dessert and escape from the table as soon as he could.\n\u3000\u3000Outside in the hall, he leaned against the wall, breathing deeply It had been a long time since he'd lost control and made something explode. He couldn't afford to let it happen again. The Hogsmeade form wasn't the only thing at stake -- if he carried on like that, he'd be in trouble with the Ministry of Magic.\n\u3000\u3000Harry was still an underage wizard, and he was forbidden by wizard law to do magic outside school. His record wasn't exactly clean either. Only last summer he'd gotten an official warning that had stated quite clearly that if the Ministry got wind of any more magic in Privet Drive, Harry would face expulsion from Hogwarts.\n\u3000\u3000He heard the Dursleys leaving the table and hurried upstairs out of the way.\n\u3000\u3000Harry got through the next three days by forcing himself to think about his Handbook of Do-It-Yourself Broomcare whenever Aunt Marge started on him. This worked quite well, though it seemed to give him a glazed look, because Aunt Marge started voicing the opinion that he was mentally subnormal.\n\u3000\u3000At last, at long last, the final evening of Marge's stay arrived. Aunt Petunia cooked a fancy dinner and Uncle Vernon uncorked several bottles of wine. They got all the way through the soup and the salmon without a single mention of Harry's faults; during the lemon meringue pie, Uncle Vernon bored them A with a long talk about Grunnings, his drill-making company; then Aunt Petunia made coffee and Uncle Vernon brought out a bottle of brandy.\n\u3000\u3000\"Can I tempt you, Marge?\"\n\u3000\u3000Aunt Marge had already had quite a lot of wine. Her huge face was very red.\n\u3000\u3000\"Just a small one, then,\" she chuckled. \"A bit more than that... and a bit more... that's the ticket.\"\n\u3000\u3000Dudley was eating his fourth slice of pie. Aunt Petunia was sipping coffee with her little finger sticking out. Harry really wanted to disappear into his bedroom, but he met Uncle Vernon's angry little eyes and knew he would have to sit it out.\n\u3000\u3000\"Aah,\" said Aunt Marge, smacking her lips and putting the empty brandy glass back down. \"Excellent nosh, Petunia. It's normally just a fry-up for me of an evening, with twelve dogs to look after....\" She burped richly and patted her great tweed stomach. \"Pardon me. But I do like to see a healthy-sized boy,\" she went on, winking at Dudley. \"You'll be a proper-sized man, Dudders, like your father. Yes, I'll have a spot more brandy, Vernon....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Now, this one here --\"\n\u3000\u3000She jerked her head at Harry, who felt his stomach clench. The Handbook, he thought quickly.\n\u3000\u3000\"This one's got a mean, runty look about him. You get that with dogs. I had Colonel Fubster drown one last year. Ratty little thing it was- Weak. Underbred.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry was trying to remember page twelve of his book: A Charm to Cure Reluctant Reversers. \"It all comes down to blood, as I was saying the other day.\n\u3000\u3000Bad blood will out. Now, I'm saying nothing against your family, Petunia\" she patted Aunt Petunia's bony hand with her shovellike one \"but your sister was a bad egg. They turn up in the best families. Then she ran off with a wastrel and here's the result right in front of us.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry was staring at his plate, a funny ringing in his ears. Grasp your broom firmly by the tail, he thought. But he couldn't remember what came next. Aunt Marge's voice seemed to be boring into him like one of Uncle Vernon's drills.\n\u3000\u3000\"This Potter, 5) said Aunt Marge loudly, seizing the brandy bottle and splashing more into her glass and over the tablecloth, \"you never told me what he did?\"\n\u3000\u3000Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia were looking extremely tense. Dudley had even looked up from his pie to gape at his parents.\n\u3000\u3000\"He -- didn't work,\" said Uncle Vernon, with half a glance at Harry. \"Unemployed.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"As I expected!\" said Aunt Marge, taking a huge swig of brandy and wiping her chin on her sleeve. \"A no-account, good-for-nothing, lazy scrounger who --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He was not,\" said Harry suddenly. The table went very quiet. Harry was shaking all over. He had never felt so angry in his life.\n\u3000\u3000\"MORE BRANDY!\" yelled Uncle Vernon, who had gone very white. He emptied the bottle into Aunt Marge's glass. \"You, boy,\" he snarled at Harry. \"Go to bed, go on --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No, Vernon,\" hiccuped Aunt Marge, holding up a hand, her tiny bloodshot eyes fixed on Harry's. \"Go on, boy, go on. Proud of your parents, are you? They go and get themselves killed in a car crash (drunk, I expect) --\"\n\u3000\u3000'They didn't die in a car crash!\" said Harry, who found himself on his feet.\n\u3000\u3000\"They died in a car crash, you nasty little liar, and left you to be a burden on their decent, hardworking relatives!\" screamed Aunt Marge, swelling with fury. \"You are an insolent, ungrateful little --\"\n\u3000\u3000But Aunt Marge suddenly stopped speaking. For a moment, it looked as though words had failed her. She seemed to be swelling with inexpressible anger -- but the swelling didn't stop. Her great red face started to expand, her tiny eyes bulged, and her mouth stretched too tightly for speech -- next second, several buttons had just burst from her tweed jacket and pinged off the walls -- she was inflating like a monstrous balloon, her stomach bursting free of her tweed waistband, each of her fingers blowing up like a salami --\n\u3000\u3000\"MARGE!\" yelled Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia together as Aunt Marge's whole body began to rise off her chair toward the ceiling. She was entirely round, now, like a vast life buoy with piggy eyes, and her hands and feet stuck out weirdly as she drifted up into the air, making apoplectic popping noises. Ripper came skidding into the room, barking madly.\n\u3000\u3000\"NOOOOOOO!\"\n\u3000\u3000Uncle Vernon seized one of Marge's feet and tried to pull her down again, but was almost lifted from the floor himself. A second later, Ripper leapt forward and sank his teeth into Uncle Vernon's leg.\n\u3000\u3000Harry tore from the dining room before anyone could stop him, heading for the cupboard under the stairs. The cupboard door burst magically open as he reached it. In seconds, he had heaved his trunk to the front door. He sprinted upstairs and threw himself under the bed, wrenching up the loose floorboard, and grabbed the pillowcase full of his books and birthday presents. He wriggled out, seized Hedwig's empty cage, and dashed back downstairs to his trunk, just as Uncle Vernon burst out of the dining room, his trouser leg in bloody tatters.\n\u3000\u3000\"COME BACK IN HERE!\" he bellowed. \"COME BACK AND PUT HER RIGHT!\"\n\u3000\u3000But a reckless rage had come over Harry. He kicked his trunk open, pulled out his wand, and pointed it at Uncle Vernon.\n\u3000\u3000\"She deserved it,\" Harry said, breathing very fast. \"She deserved what she got. You keep away from me.\"\n\u3000\u3000He fumbled behind him for the latch on the door.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm going,\" Harry said. \"I've had enough.\"\n\u3000\u3000And in the next moment, he was out in the dark, quiet street, heaving his heavy trunk behind him, Hedwig's cage under his arm.\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER THREE\n\u3000\u3000THE KNIGHT BUS\n\u3000\u3000Harry was several streets away before he collapsed onto a low wall in Magnolia Crescent, panting from the effort of dragging his trunk. He sat quite still, anger still surging through him, listening to the frantic thumping of his heart.\n\u3000\u3000But after ten minutes alone in the dark street, a new emotion overtook him: panic. Whichever way he looked at it, he had never been in a worse fix. He was stranded, quite alone, in the dark Muggle world, with absolutely nowhere to go. And the worst of it was, he had just done serious magic, which meant that he was almost certainly expelled from Hogwarts. He had broken the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry so badly, he was surprised Ministry of Magic representatives weren't swooping down on him where he sat.\n\u3000\u3000Harry shivered and looked up and down Magnolia Crescent.\n\u3000\u3000What, was going to happen to him? Would he be arrested, or would he simply be outlawed from the wizarding world? He thought of Ron and Hermione, and his heart sank even lower. Harry was sure that, criminal or not, Ron and Hermione would want to help him now, but they were both abroad, and with Hedwig gone, he had no means of contacting them.\n\u3000\u3000He didn't have any Muggle money, either. There was a little wizard gold in the money bag at the bottom of his trunk, but the rest of the fortune his parents had left him was stored in a vault at Gringotts Wizarding Bank in London. He'd never be able to drag his trunk all the way to London. Unless...\n\u3000\u3000He looked down at his wand, which he was still clutching in his hand. If he was already expelled (his heart was. now thumping painfully fast), a bit more magic couldn't hurt. He had the Invisibility Cloak he had inherited from his father -- what if he bewitched the trunk to make it feather-light, tied it to his broomstick, covered himself in the cloak, and flew to London? Then he could get the rest of his money out of his vault and... begin his life as an outcast. It was a horrible prospect, but he couldn't sit on this wall forever, or he'd find himself trying to explain to Muggle police why he was out in the dead of night with a trunkful of spellbooks and a broomstick.\n\u3000\u3000Harry opened his trunk again and pushed the contents aside, looking for the Invisibility Cloak - but before he had found it, he straightened up suddenly, looking around him once more.\n\u3000\u3000A funny prickling on the back of his neck had made Harry feel he was being watched, but the street appeared to be deserted, and no lights shone from any of the large square houses.\n\u3000\u3000He bent over his trunk again, but almost immediately stood up once more, his hand clenched on his wand. He had sensed rather than heard it: someone or something was standing in the narrow gap between the garage and the fence behind him. Harry squinted at the black alleyway. If only it would move, then he'd know whether it was just a stray cat or -- something else.\n\u3000\u3000\"Lumos,\" Harry muttered, and a light appeared at the end of his wand, almost dazzling him. He held it high over his head, and the pebble-dashed walls of number two suddenly sparkled; the garage door gleamed, and between them Harry saw, quite distinctly, the hulking outline of something very big, with wide, gleaming eyes.\n\u3000\u3000Harry stepped backward. His legs hit his trunk and he tripped. His wand flew out of his hand as he flung out an arm to break his fall, and he landed, hard, in the gutter --\n\u3000\u3000There was a deafening BANG, and Harry threw up his hands to shield his eyes against a sudden blinding light --\n\u3000\u3000With a yell, he rolled back onto the pavement, just in time. A second later, a gigantic pair of wheels and headlights screeched to a halt exactly where Harry had just been lying. They belonged, as Harry saw when he raised his head, to a triple-decker, violently purple bus, which had appeared out of thin air. Gold lettering over the windshield spelled The Knight Bus.\n\u3000\u3000For a Split second, Harry wondered if he had been knocked silly by his fall. Then a conductor in a purple uniform leapt out of the bus and began to speak loudly to the night.\n\u3000\u3000\"Welcome to the Knight Bus, emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard. just stick out your wand hand, step on board) and we can take you anywhere you want to go. My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor this eve --\"\n\u3000\u3000The conductor stopped abruptly. He had just caught sight of \"Harry, who was still sitting on the ground. Harry snatched up his wand again and scrambled to his feet. Close up, he saw that Stan Shunpike was only a few years older than he was, eighteen or nineteen at most, with large, protruding ears and quite a few pimples.\n\u3000\u3000\"What were you doin' down there?\" said Stan, dropping his professional manner.\n\u3000\u3000\"Fell over,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"'Choo fall over for?\" sniggered Stan.\n\u3000\u3000\"I didn't do it on purpose,\" said Harry, annoyed. One of the knees in his jeans was torn, and the hand he had thrown out to break his fall was bleeding. He suddenly remembered why he had fallen over and turned around quickly to stare at the alleyway between the garage and fence. The Knight Bus's headlamps were flooding it with light, and it was empty.\n\u3000\u3000\"'Choo lookin' at?\" said Stan.\n\u3000\u3000\"There was a big black thing,\" said Harry, pointing uncertainly into the gap. \"Like a dog... but massive...\"\n\u3000\u3000He looked a-round at Stan, whose mouth was slightly open. With a feeling of unease, Harry saw Stan's eyes move to the scar on Harry's forehead.\n\u3000\u3000\"Woss that on your 'ead?\" said Stan abruptly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Nothing,\" said Harry quickly, flattening his hair over his scar. If the Ministry of Magic was looking for him, he didn't want to make it too easy for them.\n\u3000\u3000\"Woss your name?\" Stan persisted.\n\u3000\u3000\"Neville Longbottom,\" said Harry, saying the first name that came into his head. \"So -- so this bus,\" he went on quickly, hoping to distract Stan, \"did you say it goes anywhere?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yep,\" said Stan proudly, \"anywhere you like, long's it's on land. Can't do nuffink underwater. 'Ere,\" he said, looking suspicious again, ,You did flag us down, dincha? Stuck out your wand 'and, dincha?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" said Harry quickly. \"Listen, how much would it be to get to London?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Eleven Sickles,\" said Stan, \"but for fifteen you get 'or chocolate, and for fifteen you get an 'ot water bottle an' a toofbrush in the color of your choice.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry rummaged once more in his trunk, extracted his money bag, and shoved some gold into Stan's hand. He and Stan then lifted his trunk, with Hedwig's cage balanced on top, up the steps of the bus.\n\u3000\u3000There were no seats; instead, half a dozen brass bedsteads stood beside the curtained windows. Candles were burning in brackets beside each bed, illuminating the wood-paneled walls. A tiny wizard in a nightcap at the rear of the bus muttered, \"Not now, thanks, I'm pickling some slugs\" and rolled over in his sleep.\n\u3000\u3000\"You 'ave this one,\" Stan whispered, shoving Harry's trunk under the bed right behind the driver, who was sitting in an armchair in front of the steering wheel. \"This is our driver, Ernie Prang. This ,is Neville Longbottom, Ern. \"\n\u3000\u3000Ernie Prang, an elderly wizard wearing very thick glasses, nodded to Harry, who nervously flattened his bangs again and sat down on his bed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Take 'er away, Ern,\" said Stan, sitting down in the armchair next to Ernie's.\n\u3000\u3000There was another tremendous BANG, and the next moment Harry found himself flat on his bed, thrown backward by the speed of the Knight Bus. Pulling himself up, Harry stared out of the dark window and saw that they were now bowling along a completely different street. Stan was watching Harry's stunned face with great enjoyment.\n\u3000\u3000\"This is where we was before you flagged us down,\" he said. \"Where are we, Ern? Somewhere in Wales?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ar,\" said Ernie.\n\u3000\u3000\"How come the Muggles don't hear the bus?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Them!\" said Stan contemptuously. \"Don' listen properly, do they? Don' look properly either. Never notice nuffink, they don'.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Best go wake up Madam Marsh, Stan,\" said Ern. \"We'll be in Abergavenny in a minute.\"\n\u3000\u3000Stan passed Harry's bed and disappeared up a narrow wooden staircase. Harry was still looking out of the window, feeling increasingly nervous. Ernie didn't seem to have mastered the use of a steering wheel. The Knight Bus kept mounting the pavement, but it didn't hit anything; lines of lampposts, mailboxes, and trash cans jumped out of its way as it approached and back into position once it had passed.\n\u3000\u3000Stan came back downstairs, followed by a faintly green witch wrapped in a traveling cloak.\n\u3000\u3000\"'Ere you go, Madam Marsh,\" said Stan happily as Ern stamped on the brake and the beds slid a foot or so toward the front of the bus. Madam Marsh clamped a handkerchief to her mouth and tottered down the steps. Stan threw her bag out after her and rammed the doors shut; there was another loud BANG, and they were thundering down a narrow country lane, trees leaping out of the way.\n\u3000\u3000Harry wouldn't have been able to sleep even if he had been traveling on a bus that didn't keep banging loudly and jumping a hundred miles at a time. His stomach churned as he fell back to wondering what was going to happen to him, and whether the Dursleys had managed to get Aunt Marge off the ceiling yet.\n\u3000\u3000Stan had unfurled a copy of the Daily Prophet and was now reading with his tongue between his teeth. A large photograph of a sunken-faced man with long, matted hair blinked slowly at Harry from the front page. He looked strangely familiar.\n\u3000\u3000\"That man!\" Harry said, forgetting his troubles for a moment. \"He was on the Muggle news!\"\n\u3000\u3000Stanley turned to the front page and chuckled.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sirius Black,\" he said, nodding. \"'Course 'e was on the Muggle news, Neville, where you been?\"\n\u3000\u3000He gave a superior sort of chuckle at the blank look on Harry's face, removed the front page, and handed it to Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"You oughta read the papers more, Neville.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry held the paper up to the candlelight and read:\n\u3000\u3000BLACK STILL AT LARGE\n\u3000\u3000Sirius Black, possibly the most infamous prisoner ever to be held in Azkaban fortress, is still eluding capture, the Ministry of Magic confirmed today.\n\u3000\u3000\"We are doing all we can to recapture Black,\" said the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge, this morning, \"and we beg the magical community to remain calm.\"\n\u3000\u3000Fudge has been criticized by some members of the International Federation of Warlocks for informing the Muggle Prime Minister of the crisis.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, really, I had to, don't you know,\" said an irritable Fudge. \"Black is mad. He's a danger to anyone who crosses him, magic or Muggle. I have the Prime Minister's assurance that he will not breathe a word of Black's true identity to anyone. And let's face it-who'd believe him if he did?\"\n\u3000\u3000While Muggles have been told that Black is carrying a gun (a kind of metal wand that Muggles use to kill each other), the magical community lives in fear of a massacre like that of twelve years ago, when Black murdered thirteen people with a single curse.\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked into the shadowed eyes of Sirius Black, the only part of the sunken face that seemed alive. Harry had never met a vampire, but he had seen pictures of them in his Defense Against the Dark Arts classes, and Black, with his waxy white skin, looked just like one.\n\u3000\u3000\"Scary-lookin' fing, inee?\" said Stan, who had been watching Harry read.\n\u3000\u3000\"He murdered thirteen people?\" said Harry, handing the page back to Stan, \"with one curse?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yep,\" said Stan, \"in front of witnesses an' all. Broad daylight. Big trouble it caused, dinnit, Ern?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ar,\" said Ern darkly.\n\u3000\u3000Stan swiveled in his armchair, his hands on the back, the better to look at Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Black woz a big supporter of You-Know-'Oo,\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000\"What, Voldemort?\" said Harry, without thinking.\n\u3000\u3000Even Stan's pimples went white; Ern jerked the steering wheel so hard that a whole farmhouse had to jump aside to avoid the bus.\n\u3000\u3000\"You outta your tree?\" yelped Stan. \"'Choo say 'is name for?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Sorry,\" said Harry hastily. \"Sorry, I -- I forgot --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Forgot!\" said Stan weakly. \"Blimey, my 'eart's goin' that fast ...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"So -- so Black was a supporter of You-Know-Who?\" Harry prompted apologetically.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah,\" said Stan, still rubbing his chest. \"Yeah, that's right. Very close to You-Know-'Oo, they say. Anyway, when little 'Arry Potter got the better of You-Know-'Oo --\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry nervously flattened his bangs down again.\n\u3000\u3000\"-- all You-Know-'Oo's supporters was tracked down, wasn't they, Ern? Most of 'em knew it was all over, wiv You-Know-'Oo gone, and they came quiet. But not Sirius Black. I 'eard he thought 'e'd be second-in-command once You-Know-'Oo 'ad taken over.\n\u3000\u3000\"Anyway, they cornered Black in the middle of a street full of Muggles an' Black took out 'is wand and 'e blasted 'alf the street apart, an' a wizard got it, an' so did a dozen Muggles what got in the way. 'Orrible, eh? An' you know what Black did then?\" Stan continued in a dramatic whisper.\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Laughed,\" said Stan. \"Jus' stood there an' laughed. An' when reinforcements from the Ministry of Magic got there, I 'e went wiv em quiet as anyfink, still laughing 'is 'ead off. 'Cos 'e's mad, inee, Ern? Inee mad?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"If he weren't when he went to Azkaban, he will be now,\" said Ern in his slow voice. \"I'd blow meself up before I set foot in that place. Serves him right, mind you ... after what he did....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"They 'ad a job coverin' it up, din' they, Ern?\" Stan said. \"'Ole street blown up an' all them Muggles dead. What was it they said ad 'appened, Ern?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Gas explosion,\" grunted Ernie.\n\u3000\u3000\"An' now 'e's out,\" said Stan, examining the newspaper picture of Black's gaunt face again. \"Never been a breakout from Azkaban before, 'as there, Ern? Beats me 'ow 'e did it. Frightenin', eh? Mind, I don't fancy 'is chances against them Azkaban guards, eh, Ern?\"\n\u3000\u3000Ernie suddenly shivered.\n\u3000\u3000\"Talk about summat else, Stan, there's a good lad. Them Azkaban guards give me the collywobbles.\"\n\u3000\u3000Stan put the paper away reluctantly, and Harry leaned against the window of the Knight Bus, feeling worse than ever. He couldn't help imagining what Stan might be telling his passengers in a few nights' time.\n\u3000\u3000\"'Ear about that 'Arry Potter? Blew up 'is aunt! We 'ad 'im 'ere on the Knight Bus, di'n't we, Ern? 'E was tryin' I to run for it....\"\n\u3000\u3000He, Harry, had broken wizard law just like Sirius Black. Was inflating Aunt Marge bad enough to land him in Azkaban? Harry didn't know anything about the wizard prison, though everyone he'd ever heard speak of it did so in the same fearful tone. Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, had spent two months there only last year. Harry wouldn't soon forget the look of terror on Hagrid's face when he had been told where he was going, and Hagrid was one of the bravest people Harry knew.\n\u3000\u3000The Knight Bus rolled through the darkness, scattering bushes and wastebaskets, telephone booths and trees, and Harry lay, restless and miserable, on his feather bed. After a while, Stan remembered that Harry had paid for hot chocolate, but poured it all over Harry's pillow when the bus moved abruptly from Anglesea to Aberdeen. One by one, wizards and witches in dressing gowns and slippers descended from the upper floors to leave the bus. They all looked very pleased to go.\n\u3000\u3000Finally, Harry was the only passenger left.\n\u3000\u3000\"Right then, Neville,\" said Stan, clapping his hands, where abouts in London?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Diagon Alley,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Righto,\" said Stan. \"'Old tight, then.\"\n\u3000\u3000BANG.\n\u3000\u3000They were thundering along Charing Cross Road. Harry sat up and watched buildings and benches squeezing themselves out of the Knight Bus's way. The sky was getting a little lighter. He would lie low for a couple of hours, go to Gringotts the. moment it opened, then set off -- where, he didn't know.\n\u3000\u3000Ern slammed on the brakes and the Knight Bus skidded to a halt in front of a small and shabby- looking pub, the Leaky Cauldron, behind which lay the magical entrance to Diagon Alley.\n\u3000\u3000\"Thanks,\" Harry said to Ern.\n\u3000\u3000He jumped down the steps and helped Stan lower his trunk and Hedwig's cage onto the pavement.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well,\" said Harry. \"'Bye then!\"\n\u3000\u3000But Stan wasn't paying attention. Still standing in the doorway to the bus) he was goggling at the shadowy entrance to the Leaky Cauldron. \"There you are, Harry,\" said a voice.\n\u3000\u3000Before Harry could turn, he felt a hand on his shoulder. At the same time, Stan shouted, \"Blimey! Ern, come 'ere! Come 'ere I\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked up at the owner of the hand on his shoulder and felt a bucketful of ice cascade into his stomach -- he had walked right into Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic himself.\n\u3000\u3000Stan leapt onto the pavement beside them.\n\u3000\u3000\"What didja call Neville, Minister?\" he said excitedly.\n\u3000\u3000Fudge, a portly little man in a long, pinstriped cloak, looked cold and exhausted.\n\u3000\u3000\"Neville?\" he repeated, frowning. \"This is Harry Potter.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I knew it!\" Stan shouted gleefully. \"Ern! Ern! Guess 'oo Neville is, Ern! 'E's 'Arry Potter! I can see 'is scar!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" said Fudge testily, \"well, I'm very glad the Knight Bus picked Harry up, but he and I need to step inside the Leaky Cauldron now...\"\n\u3000\u3000Fudge increased the pressure on Harry's shoulder, and Harry found himself being steered inside the pub. A stooping figure bearing a lantern appeared through the door behind the bar. It was Tom, the wizened, toothless landlord.\n\u3000\u3000\"You've got him, Minister!\" said Tom. \"Will you be wanting anything? Beer? Brandy?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Perhaps a pot of tea,\" said Fudge, who still hadn't let go of Harry.\n\u3000\u3000There was a loud scraping and puffing from behind them, and Stan and Ern appeared, carrying Harry's trunk and Hedwig's cage and looking around excitedly.\n\u3000\u3000\"'Ow come you di'n't tell us 'oo you are, eh, Neville?\" said Stan, beaming at Harry, while Ernie's owlish face peered interestedly over Stan's shoulder.\n\u3000\u3000\"And a private parlor, please, Tom,\" said Fudge pointedly.\n\u3000\u3000`Bye,\" Harry said miserably to Stan and Ern as Tom beckoned Fudge toward the passage that led from the bar.\n\u3000\u3000\"'Bye, Neville!\" called Stan.\n\u3000\u3000Fudge marched Harry along the narrow passage after Tom's lantern, and then into a small parlor. Tom clicked his fingers, a fire burst into life in the grate, and he bowed himself out of the room.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sit down, Harry,\" said Fudge, indicating a chair by the fire.\n\u3000\u3000Harry sat down, feeling goose bumps rising up his arms despite the glow of the fire. Fudge took off his pinstriped cloak and tossed it aside, then hitched up the trousers of his bottle-green suit and sat down opposite Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"I am Cornelius Fudge, Harry. The Minister of Magic.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry already knew this, of course; he had seen Fudge once before, but as he had been wearing his father's Invisibility Cloak at the time, Fudge wasn't to know that.\n\u3000\u3000Tom the innkeeper reappeared, wearing an apron over his nightshirt and bearing a tray of tea and crumpets. He placed the tray on a table between Fudge and Harry and left the parlor, closing the door behind him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, Harry,\" said Fudge, pouring out tea, \"you've had us all in a right flap, I don't mind telling you. Running away from your aunt and uncle's house like that! I'd started to think... but you're safe, and that's what matters.\"\n\u3000\u3000Fudge buttered himself a crumpet and pushed the plate toward Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Eat, Harry, you look dead on your feet. Now then... You will be pleased to hear that we have dealt with the unfortunate blowing-up of Miss Marjorie Dursley. Two members of the Accidental Magic Reversal Department were dispatched to Privet Drive a few hours ago. Miss Dursley has been punctured and her memory has been modified. She has no recollection of the incident at all. So that's that, and no harm done.\"\n\u3000\u3000Fudge smiled at Harry over the rim of his teacup, rather like an uncle surveying a favorite nephew. Harry, who couldn't believe his ears, opened his mouth to speak, couldn't think of anything to say, and closed it again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah, you're worrying about the reaction of your aunt and uncle?\" said Fudge. \"Well, I won't deny that they are extremely angry, Harry, but they are prepared to take you back next summer as long as you stay at Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry unstuck his throat.\n\u3000\u3000\"I always stay at Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays,\" he said, \"and I don't ever want to go back to Privet Drive.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Now, now, I'm sure you'll feel differently once you've calmed down,\" said Fudge in a worried tone. \"They are your family, after all, and I'm sure you are fond of each other -- er -- very deep down.\"\n\u3000\u3000It didn't occur to Harry to put Fudge right. He was still waiting to hear what was going to happen to him now.\n\u3000\u3000\"So all that remains,\" said Fudge, now buttering himself a second crumpet, \"is to decide where you're going to spend the last two weeks of your vacation. I suggest you take a room here at the Leaky Cauldron and\n\u3000\u3000\"Hang on,\" blurted Harry. \"What about my punishment?\"\n\u3000\u3000Fudge blinked. \"Punishment?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I broke the law!\" Harry said. \"The Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, my dear boy, we're not going to punish you for a little thing like that!\" cried Fudge, waving his crumpet impatiently. \"It was an accident! We don't send people to Azkaban just for blowing up their aunts!\"\n\u3000\u3000But this didn't tally at all with Harry's past dealings with the Ministry of Magic.\n\u3000\u3000\"Last year, I got an official warning just because a house-elf smashed a pudding in my uncle's house!\" he told Fudge, frowning. \"The Ministry of Magic said I'd be expelled from Hogwarts if there was any more magic there!\"\n\u3000\u3000Unless Harry's eyes were deceiving him, Fudge was suddenly looking awkward.\n\u3000\u3000\"Circumstances change, Harry... We have to take into account... in the present climate... Surely you don't want to be expelled?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Of course I don't,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well then, what's A the fuss about?\" laughed Fudge. \"Now, have a crumpet, Harry, while I go and see if Tom's got a room for you.\"\n\u3000\u3000Fudge strode out of the parlor and Harry stared after him. There was something extremely odd going on. Why had Fudge been waiting for him at the Leaky Cauldron, if not to punish him for what he'd done? And now Harry came to think of it, surely it wasn't usual for the Minister of Magic himself to get involved in matters of underage magic?\n\u3000\u3000Fudge came back, accompanied by Tom the innkeeper.\n\u3000\u3000\"Room eleven's free, Harry,\" said Fudge. \"I think you'll be very comfortable. just one thing, and I'm sure you'll understand... I don't want you wandering off into Muggle London, all right? Keep to Diagon Alley. And you're to be back here before dark each night. Sure you'll understand. Tom will be keeping an eye on you for me.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Okay,\" said Harry slowly, \"but why?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't want to lose you again, do we?\" said Fudge with a hearty laugh. \"No, no... best we know where you are.... I mean...\"\n\u3000\u3000Fudge cleared his throat loudly and picked up his pinstriped cloak.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, I'll be off, plenty to do, you know...\n\u3000\u3000\"Have you had any luck with Black yet?\" Harry asked.\n\u3000\u3000Fudge's finger slipped on the silver fastenings of his cloak.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's that? Oh, you've heard -- well, no, not yet, but it's only a matter of time. The Azkaban guards have never yet failed... and they are angrier than I've ever seen them.\"\n\u3000\u3000Fudge shuddered slightly.\n\u3000\u3000\"So, I'll say good-bye.\"\n\u3000\u3000He held out his hand and Harry, shaking it, had a sudden idea.\n\u3000\u3000\"Er -- Minister? Can I ask you something?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Certainly,\" said Fudge with a smile.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, third years at Hogwarts are allowed to visit Hogsmeade, but my aunt and uncle didn't sign the permission form. D'you think you could --?\"\n\u3000\u3000Fudge was looking uncomfortable.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah,\" he said. \"No, no, I'm very sorry, Harry, but as I'm not your parent or guardian --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But you I re the Minister of Magic,\" said Harry eagerly. \"If you gave me permission\n\u3000\u3000\"No, I'm sorry, Harry, but rules are rules,\" said Fudge flatly.\n\u3000\u3000'Perhaps You'll be able to visit Hogsmeade next year. In fact, I think it's best if you don't... yes... well, I'll be off Enjoy your stay, Harry.\"\n\u3000\u3000And with a last smile and shake of Harry's hand, Fudge left the room. Tom now moved forward, beaming at Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"If you'll follow me, Mr. Potter,\" he said, \"I've already taken your things up...\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry followed Tom up a handsome wooden staircase to a door with a brass number eleven on it, which Tom unlocked and opened for him.\n\u3000\u3000Inside was a very comfortable-looking bed, some highly polished oak furniture, a cheerfully crackling fire and, perched on top of the wardrobe -\n\u3000\u3000\"Hedwig!\" Harry gasped.\n\u3000\u3000The snowy owl clicked her beak and fluttered down onto Harry's arm.\n\u3000\u3000\"Very smart owl you've got there, chuckled Tom. \"Arrived about five minutes after you did. If there's anything you need, Mr. Potter, don't hesitate to ask.\"\n\u3000\u3000He gave another bow and left.\n\u3000\u3000Harry sat on his bed for a long time, absentmindedly stroking Hedwig. The sky outside the window was changing rapidly from deep, velvety blue to cold, steely gray and then, slowly, to pink shot with gold. Harry could hardly believe that he'd left Privet Drive only a few hours ago, that he wasn't expelled, and that he was now facing two completely Dursley-free weeks.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's been a very weird night, Hedwig,\" he yawned.\n\u3000\u3000And without even removing his glasses, he slumped back onto his pillows and fell asleep.\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER FOUR\n\u3000\u3000THE LEAKY CAULDRON\n\u3000\u3000It took Harry several days to get used to his strange new freedom. Never before had he been able to get up whenever he wanted or eat whatever he fancied. He could even go wherever he pleased, as long as it was in Diagon Alley, and as this long cobbled street was packed with the most fascinating wizarding shops in the world, Harry felt no desire to break his word to Fudge and stray back into the Muggle world.\n\u3000\u3000Harry ate breakfast each morning in the Leaky Cauldron, where he liked watching the other guests: funny little witches from the country, up for a day's shopping; venerable-looking wizards arguing over the latest article in Transfiguration Today; wild-looking warlocks; raucous dwarfs; and once, what looked suspiciously like a hag, who ordered a plate of raw liver from behind a thick woollen balaclava.\n\u3000\u3000After breakfast Harry would go out into the backyard, take out his wand, tap the third brick from the left above the trash bit,, and stand back as the archway into Diagon Alley opened in the wall.\n\u3000\u3000Harry spent the long sunny days exploring the shops and eating under the brightly colored umbrellas outside cafes, where his fellow diners were showing one another their purchases ( \" it , s a lunascope, old boy -- no more messing around with moon charts, see?\") or else discussing the case of Sirius Black (\"personalty, I won't let any of the children out alone until he's back in Azkaban\"). Harry didn't have to do his homework under the blankets by flashlight anymore; now he could sit in the bright sunshine outside Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlor, finishing all his essays with occasional help from Florean Fortescue himself, who, apart from knowing a great deal about medieval witch burnings, gave Harry free sundaes every half an hour.\n\u3000\u3000Once Harry had refilled his money bag with gold Galleons, silver Sickles, and bronze Knuts from his vault at Gringotts, he had to exercise a lot of self-control not to spend the whole lot at once. He had to keep reminding himself that he had five years to go at Hogwarts, and how it would feel to ask the Dursleys for money for spellbooks, to stop himself from buying a handsome set of solid gold Gobstones (a wizarding game rather like marbles, in which the stones squirt a nasty-smelling liquid into the other player's face when they lose a point). He was sorely tempted, too, by the perfect, moving model of the galaxy in a large glass ball, which would have meant he never had to take another Astronomy lesson. But the thing that tested Harry's resolution most appeared in his favorite shop, Quality Quidditch Supplies, a week after he'd arrived at the Leaky Cauldron.\n\u3000\u3000Curious to know what the crowd in the shop was staring at, Harry edged his way inside and squeezed in among the excited witches and wizards until he glimpsed a newly erected podium, on which was mounted the most magnificent broom he had ever seen in his life.\n\u3000\u3000\"Just come out -- prototype --\" a square-jawed wizard was telling his companion.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's the fastest broom in the world, isn't it, Dad?\" squeaked a boy younger than Harry, who was swinging off his father's arm.\n\u3000\u3000\"Irish International Side's Just put in an order for seven of these beauties!\" the proprietor of the shop told the crowd. \"And they're favorites for the World Cup!\"\n\u3000\u3000A large witch in front of Harry moved, and he was able to read the sign next to the broom:\n\u3000\u3000** THE FIREBOLT **\n\u3000\u3000THIS STATE-OF-THE-ART PACING BROOM SPORTS A STREAM-LINED, SUPERFINE HANDLE OF ASH, TREATED WITH A DIAMOND-HARD POLISH AND HAND- NUMBERED WITH ITS OWN REGISTRATION NUMBER. EACH INDIVIDUALLY SELECTED BIRCH TWIG IN THE BROOMTAIL HAS BEEN HONED TO AERODYNAMIC PERFECTION, GIVING THE FIREBOLT UNSURPASSABLE BALANCE AND PINPOINT PRECISION. THE FIREBOLT HAS AN ACCELERATION OF 150 MILES AN HOUR IN TEN SECONDS AND INCORPORATES AN UNBREAKABLE BRAKING CHARM. PRICE ON REQUEST.\n\u3000\u3000Price on request... Harry didn't like to think how much gold the Firebolt would cost. He had never wanted anything as much in his whole life -- but he had never lost a Quidditch match on his Nim bus Two Thousand, and what was the point in emptying his Gringotts vault for the Firebolt, when he had a very good broom already? Harry didn't ask for the price, but he returned, almost every day after that, just to look at the Firebolt.\n\u3000\u3000There were, however, things that Harry needed to buy. He went to the Apothecary to replenish his store of potions ingredients, and as his school robes were now several inches too short in the arm and leg, he visited Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions and bought new ones. Most important of all, he had to buy his new schoolbooks, which would include those for his two new subjects, Care of Magical Creatures and Divination.\n\u3000\u3000Harry got a surprise as he looked in at the bookshop window. Instead of the usual display of gold- embossed spellbooks the size of paving slabs, there was a large iron cage behind the glass that held about a hundred copies of The Monster Book of Monsters. Torn pages were flying everywhere as the books grappled with each other, locked together in furious wrestling matches and snapping aggressively.\n\u3000\u3000Harry pulled his booklist out of his pocket and consulted it for the first time. The Monster Book of Monsters was listed as the required book for Care of Magical Creatures. Now Harry understood why Hagrid had said it would come in useful. He felt relieved; he had been wondering whether Hagrid wanted help with some terrifying new pet.\n\u3000\u3000As Harry entered Flourish and Blotts, the manager came hurrying toward him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hogwarts?\" he said abruptly. \"Come to get your new books?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" said Harry, \"I need --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Get out of the way,\" said the manager impatiently, brushing Harry aside. He drew on a pair of very thick gloves, picked up a large, knobbly walking stick, and proceeded toward the door of the Monster Books' cage.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hang on,\" said Harry quickly, \"I've already got one of those.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Have you?\" A look of enormous relief spread over the manager's face. \"Thank heavens for that. I've been bitten five times already this morning --\"\n\u3000\u3000A loud ripping noise rent the air; two of the Monster Books had seized a third and were pulling it apart.\n\u3000\u3000\"Stop it! Stop it!\" cried the manager, poking the walking stick through the bars and knocking the books apart. \"I'm never stocking them again, never! It's been bedlam! I thought we'd seen the worst when we bought two hundred copies of the Invisible Book of Invisibility -cost a fortune, and we never found them.... Well... is there anything else I can help you with?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" said Harry, looking down his booklist, \"I need Unfogging the Future by Cassandra Vablatsky.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah, starting Divination, are you?\" said the manager, stripping off his gloves and leading Harry into the back of the shop, where there was a corner devoted to fortune-telling. A small table was stacked with volumes such as Predicting the Unpredictable: Insulate Yourself Against Shocks and Broken Balls: When Fortunes Turn Foul.\n\u3000\u3000\"Here you are,,' said the manager, who had climbed a set of steps to take down a thick, black- bound book. \"Unfogging the Future. Very good guide to all your basic fortune-telling methods - palmistry, crystal balls, bird entrails.\n\u3000\u3000But Harry wasn't listening. His eyes had fallen on another book, which was among a display on a small table: Death Omens.- What to Do When You Know the Worst Is Coming.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, I wouldn't read that if I were you,\" said the manager lightly, looking to see what Harry was staring at. \"You'll start seeing death omens everywhere. It's enough to frighten anyone to death. \"\n\u3000\u3000But Harry continued to stare at the front cover of the book; it showed a black dog large as a bear, with gleaming eyes. It looked oddly familiar...\n\u3000\u3000The manager pressed Unfogging the Future into Harry's hands.\n\u3000\u3000\"Anything else?\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" said Harry, tearing his eyes away from the dog's and dazedly consulting his booklist. \"Er -- I need Intermediate Transfiguration and The Standard Book of Spells, Grade Three.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry emerged from Flourish and Blotts ten minutes later with his new books under his arms and made his way back to the Leaky Cauldron, hardly noticing where he was going and bumping into several people.\n\u3000\u3000He tramped up the stairs to his room, went inside, and tipped his books onto his bed. Somebody had been in to tidy; the windows were open and sun was pouring inside. Harry could hear the buses rolling by in the unseen Muggle street behind him and the sound of the invisible crowd below in Diagon Alley. He caught sight of himself in the mirror over the basin.\n\u3000\u3000\"It can't have been a death omen,\" he told his reflection defiantly. \"I was panicking when I saw that thing in Magnolia Crescent.... It was probably just a stray dog....\"\n\u3000\u3000He raised his hand automatically and tried to make his hair lie flat\n\u3000\u3000\"You're fighting a losing battle there, dear,\" said his mirror in a vvheezy voice.\n\u3000\u3000As the days slipped by, Harry started looking wherever he went for a sign of Ron or Hermione. Plenty of Hogwarts students were arriving in Diagon Alley now, with the start of term so near. Harry met Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas, his fellow Gryffindors, in Quality Quidditch Supplies, where they too were ogling the Firebolt; he also ran into the real Neville Longbottom, a round-faced, forgetful boy, outside Flourish and Blotts. Harry didn't stop to chat; Neville appeared to have mislaid his booklist and was being told off by his very formidable-looking grandmother. Harry hoped she never found out that he'd pretended to be Neville while on the run from the Ministry of Magic.\n\u3000\u3000Harry woke on the last day of the holidays, thinking that he would at least meet Ron and Hermione tomorrow, on the Hogwarts Express. He got up, dressed, went for a last look at the Firebolt, and was just wondering where he'd have lunch, when someone yelled his name and he turned.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry! HARRY!\"\n\u3000\u3000They were there, both of them, sitting outside Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlor -- Ron looking incredibly freckly, Her,,one very brown, both waving frantically at him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Finally!\" said Ron, grinning at Harry as he sat down. \"We went to the Leaky Cauldron, but they said you'd left, and we went to Flourish and Blotts, and Madam Malkin's, and --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I got all my school stuff last week,\" Harry explained. \"And how come You knew I'm staying at the Leaky Cauldron?\" \"Dad,\" said Ron simply.\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Weasley, who worked at the Ministry of Magic, would of course have heard the whole story of what had happened to Aunt Marge.\n\u3000\u3000\"Did you really blow up your aunt, Harry?\" said Hermione in a very serious voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"I didn't mean to,\" said Harry, while Ron roared with laughter. \"I just -- lost control.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It's not funny, Ron,\" said Hermione sharply. \"Honestly, I'm amazed Harry wasn't expelled.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"So am I,\" admitted Harry. \"Forget expelled, I thought I was going to be arrested.\" He looked at Ron. \"Your dad doesn't know why Fudge let me off, does he?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Probably 'cause it's you, isn't it?\" shrugged Ron, still chuckling. \"Famous Harry Potter and all that. I'd hate to see what the Ministry'd do to me if I blew up an aunt. Mind you, they'd have to dig me up first, because Mum would've killed me. Anyway, you can ask Dad yourself this evening. We're staying at the Leaky Cauldron tonight too! So you can come to King's Cross with us tomorrow! Hermione's there as well!\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione nodded, beaming. \"Mum and Dad dropped me off this morning with all my Hogwarts things.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Excellent!\" said Harry happily. \"So, have you got all your new books and stuff?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Look at this,\" said Ron, pulling a long thin box out of a bag and opening it. \"Brand-new wand. Fourteen inches, willow, containing one unicorn tail-hair. And we've got all our books --\" He pointed at a large bag under his chair. \"What about those Monster Books, eh? The assistant nearly cried when we said we wanted two.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What's all that, Hermione?\" Harry asked, pointing at not one but three bulging bags in the chair next to her.\n\u3000\u3000,,Well, I'm taking more new subjects than you, aren't IF' said Hermione. \"Those are my books for Arithmancy, Care of Magical Creatures, Divination, the Study of Ancient Runes, Muggle Studies --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What are you doing Muggle Studies for?\" said Ron, rolling his eyes at Harry. \"You're Muggle- born! Your mum and dad are Muggles! You already know all about Muggles!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But it'll be fascinating to study them from the wizarding point of view,\" said Hermione earnestly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Are you planning to eat or sleep at all this year, Hermione?\" asked Harry, while Ron sniggered. Hermione ignored them.\n\u3000\u3000\"I've still got ten Galleons,\" she said, checking her purse. \"It's my birthday in September, and Mum and Dad gave me some money to get myself an early birthday present.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"How about a nice book? said Ron innocently.\n\u3000\u3000\"No, I don't think so,\" said Hermione composedly. \"I really want an owl. I mean, Harry's got Hedwig and you've got Errol --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I haven't,\" said Ron. \"Errol's a family owl. All I've got is Scabbers.\" He pulled his pet rat out of his pocket. \"And I want to get him checked over,\" he added, placing Scabbers on the table in front of them. \"I don't think Egypt agreed with him.\"\n\u3000\u3000Scabbers was looking thinner than usual, and there was a definite droop to his whiskers.\n\u3000\u3000\"There's a magical creature shop just over there,\" said Harry, who knew Diagon Alley very well by now. \"You could see if they've got anything for Scabbers, and Hermione can get her owl,\"\n\u3000\u3000So they paid for their ice cream and crossed the street to the Magical Menagerie.\n\u3000\u3000There wasn't much room inside. Every inch of wall was hidden by cages. It was smelly and very noisy because the occupants Of these cages were all squeaking, squawking, jabbering, or hissing. The witch behind the counter was already advising a wizard on the care of double-ended newts, so Harry, Ron, and Hermione waited, examining the cages.\n\u3000\u3000A pair of enormous purple toads sat gulping wetly and feasting on dead blowflies. A gigantic tortoise with a jewel-encrusted shell was glittering near the window. Poisonous orange snails were oozing slowly up the side of their glass tank, and a fat white rabbit kept changing into a silk top hat and back again with a loud popping noise. Then there were cats of every color, a noisy cage of ravens, a basket of funny custard-colored furballs that were humming loudly, and on the counter, a vast cage of sleek black rats that were playing some sort of skipping game using their long, bald tails.\n\u3000\u3000The double-ended newt wizard left, and Ron approached the counter.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's my rat,\" he told the witch. \"He been a bit off-color ever since I brought him back from Egypt.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Bang him on the counter,\" said the witch, pulling a pair of heavy black spectacles out of her pocket.\n\u3000\u3000Ron lifted Scabbers out of his inside pocket and placed him next to the cage of his fellow rats, who stopped their skipping tricks and scuffled to the wire for a better took.\n\u3000\u3000Like nearly everything Ron owned, Scabbers the rat was secondhand (he had once belonged to Ron's brother Percy) and a bit battered. Next to the glossy rats in the cage, he looked especially woebegone.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hm,\" said the witch, picking up Scabbers. \"How old is this rat?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Dunno,\" said Ron. \"Quite old. He used to belong to my brother.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What powers does he have?\" said the witch, examining Scabbers closely.\n\u3000\u3000\"Er --\" The truth was that Scabbers had never shown the faintest trace of interesting powers. The witchs eyes moved from Scabbers's tattered left ear to his front paw, which had a toe missing, and tutted loudly.\n\u3000\u3000\"He's been through the mill, this one,\" she said.\n\u3000\u3000\"He was like that when Percy gave him to me,\" said Ron defensively.\n\u3000\u3000\"An ordinary common or garden rat like this can't be expected to live longer than three years or so,\" said the witch. \"Now, if you were looking for something a bit more hard-wearing, you might like one of these --\"\n\u3000\u3000She indicated the black rats, who promptly started skipping again. Ron muttered, \"Show-offs.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, if you Don't want a replacement, you can try this rat tonic,\" said the witch, reaching under the counter and bringing out a small red bottle.\n\u3000\u3000\"Okay,\" said Ron. \"How much -- OUCH!\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron buckled as something huge and orange came soaring from the top of the highest cage, landed on his head, and then propelled itself, spitting madly, at Scabbers.\n\u3000\u3000\"NO, CROOKSHANKS, NO!\" cried the witch, but Scabbers, shot from between her hands like a bar of soap, landed splay-legged on the floor, and then scampered for the door.\n\u3000\u3000\"Scabbers!\" Ron shouted, racing out of the shop after him; Harry followed.\n\u3000\u3000It took them nearly ten minutes to catch Scabbers, who had taken refuge under a wastepaper bin outside Quality Quidditch Supplies. Ron stuffed the trembling rat back into his pocket and straightened up, massaging his head.\n\u3000\u3000\"What was that?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It was either a very big cat or quite a small tiger,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Where's Hermione?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Probably getting her owl\n\u3000\u3000They made their way back up the crowded street to the Magical Menagerie. As they reached it, Hermione came out, but she wasn't carrying an owl. Her arms were clamped tightly around the enormous ginger cat.\n\u3000\u3000\"You bought that monster?\" said Ron, his mouth hanging open.\n\u3000\u3000\"He's gorgeous, isn't he?\" said Hermione, glowing.\n\u3000\u3000That was a matter of opinion, thought Harry. The cat's ginger fur was thick and fluffy, but it was definitely a bit bowlegged and its face looked grumpy and oddly squashed, as though it had run headlong into a brick wall. Now that Scabbers was out of sight, however, the cat was purring contentedly in Hermione's arms.\n\u3000\u3000\"Herinione, that thing nearly scalped me!\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"He didn't mean to, did you, Crookshanks?\" said Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"And what about Scabbers?\" said Ron, pointing at the lump in his chest pocket. \"He needs rest and relaxation! How's he going to get it with that thing around?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That reminds me, you forgot your rat tonic,\" said Hermione, slapping the small red bottle into Ron's hand. \"And stop worrying, Crookshanks will be sleeping in my dormitory and Scabbers in yours, what's the problem? Poor Crookshanks, that witch said he'd been in there for ages; no one wanted him.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Wonder why,\" said Ron sarcastically as they set off toward the Leaky Cauldron.\n\u3000\u3000They found Mr. Weasley sitting in the bar, reading the Daily prophet.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry!\" he said, smiling as he looked up. \"How are you?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Fine, thanks,\" said Harry as he, Ron, and Hermione joined Mr. Weasley with A their shopping.\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Weasley put down his paper, and Harry saw the now familiar picture of Sirius Black staring up at him.\n\u3000\u3000\"They still haven't caught him, then?\" he asked.\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Mr. Weasley, looking extremely grave. \"They've pulled us all off our regular jobs at the Ministry to try and find him, but no luck so far.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Would we get a reward if we caught him?\" asked Ron. \"It'd be good to get some more money --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't be ridiculous, Ron,\" said Mr. Weasley, who on closer inspection looked very strained. \"Black's not going to be caught by a thirteen-year-old wizard. It's the Azkaban guards who'll get him back, You mark my words.\"\n\u3000\u3000At that moment Mrs. Weasley entered the bar, laden with shopping bags and followed by the twins, Fred and George, who were about to start their fifth year at Hogwarts; the newly elected Head Boy, Percy; and the Weasleys' youngest child and only girl, Ginny.\n\u3000\u3000Ginny, who had always been very taken with Harry, seemed even more heartily embarrassed than usual when she saw him, perhaps because he had saved her life during their previous year at Hogwarts. She went very red and muttered \"hello\" without looking at him. Percy, however, held out his hand solemnly as though he and Harry had never met and said, \"Harry. How nice to see you.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hello, Percy,\" said Harry, trying not to laugh.\n\u3000\u3000I hope you're well?\" said Percy pompously, shaking hands. It was rather like being introduced to the mayor.\n\u3000\u3000\"Very well, thanks --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry!\" said Fred, elbowing Percy out of the way and bowing deeply. \"Simply splendid to see you, old boy --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Marvelous,\" said George, pushing Fred aside and seizing Harry's hand in turn. \"Absolutely spiffing.\"\n\u3000\u3000Percy scowled.\n\u3000\u3000\"That's enough, now,\" said Mrs. Weasley.\n\u3000\u3000\"Mum!\" said Fred as though he'd only just spotted her and seizing her hand too. \"How really corking to see you --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I said, that's enough,\" said Mrs. Weasley, depositing her shopping in an empty chair. \"Hello, Harry, dear. I suppose you've heard our exciting news?\" She pointed to the brand-new silver badge on Percy's chest. \"Second Head Boy in the family!\" she said, swelling with pride.\n\u3000\u3000\"And last,\" Fred muttered under his breath.\n\u3000\u3000I don't doubt that,\" said Mrs. Weasley, frowning suddenly. \"I notice they haven't made you two prefects.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What do we want to be prefects for?\" said George, looking revolted at the very idea. \"It'd take all the fun out of life.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ginny giggled.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yo u want to set a better example for your sister!\" snapped Mrs. Weasley.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ginny's got other brothers to set her an example, Mother,\" said Percy loftily. \"I'm going up to change for dinner...\"\n\u3000\u3000He disappeared and George heaved a sigh.\n\u3000\u3000\"We tried to shut him in a pyramid,\" he told Harry. \"But Mum spotted us.\"\n\u3000\u3000Dinner that night was a very enjoyable affair. Tom the innkeeper put three tables together in the parlor, and the seven Weasleys, Harry, and Hermione ate their way through five delicious courses.\n\u3000\u3000\"How're we getting to King's Cross tomorrow, Dad?\" asked Fred as they dug into a sumptuous chocolate pudding.\n\u3000\u3000\"The Ministry's providing a couple of cars,\" said Mr. Weasley.\n\u3000\u3000Everyone looked up at him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Why?\" said Percy curiously.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's because of you, Perce,\" said George seriously. \"And there'll be little flags on the hoods, with HB on them\"\n\u3000\u3000\"-- for Humongous Bighead,\" said Fred.\n\u3000\u3000Everyone except Percy and Mrs. Weasley snorted into their pudding.\n\u3000\u3000\"Why are the Ministry providing cars, Father?\" Percy asked again, in a dignified voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, as we haven't got one anymore,\" said Mr. Weasley,\n\u3000\u3000\"-- and as I work there, they're doing me a favor --\"\n\u3000\u3000His voice was casual, but Harry couldn't help noticing that Mr. Weasley's ears had gone red, just like Ron's did when he was under Pressure.\n\u3000\u3000\"Good thing, too,\" said Mrs. Weasley briskly. \"Do you realize how much luggage you've all got between you? A nice sight you'd be on the Muggle Underground.... You are all packed, aren't you?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron hasn't put all his new things in his trunk yet,\" said Percy, in a long-suffering voice. \"He's dumped them on my bed.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You'd better go and pack properly, Ron, because we won't have much time in the morning,\" Mrs. Weasley called down the table. Ron scowled at Percy.\n\u3000\u3000After dinner everyone felt very full and sleepy. One by one they made their way upstairs to their rooms to check their things for the next day. Ron and Percy were next door to Harry. He had just closed and locked his own trunk when he heard angry voices through the wall, and went to see what was going on.\n\u3000\u3000The door of number twelve was ajar and Percy was shouting.\n\u3000\u3000\"It was here, on the bedside table, I took it off for polishing\n\u3000\u3000\"I haven't touched it, all right?\" Ron roared back.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's up?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"My Head Boy badge is gone,\" said Percy, rounding on Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"So's Scabbers's rat tonic,\" said Ron, throwing things out of his trunk to look. \"I think I might've left it in the bar --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You're not going anywhere till you've found my badge!\" yelled Percy.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll get Scabbers's stuff, I'm packed,\" Harry said to Ron, and he went downstairs.\n\u3000\u3000Harry was halfway along the passage to the bar, which was now very dark, when he heard another pair of angry voices coming from the parlor. A second later, he recognized them as Mr. and Mrs.\n\u3000\u3000Weasleys'. He hesitated, not wanting them to know he'd heard them arguing, when the sound of his own name made him stop, then move closer to the parlor door.\n\u3000\u3000\"--makes no sense not to tell him,\" Mr. Weasley was saying heatedly. \"Harry's got a right to know. I've tried to tell Fudge, but he insists on treating Harry like a child. He's thirteen years old and --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Arthur, the truth would terrify him!\" said Mrs. Weasley shrilly. \"Do you really want to send Harry back to school with that hanging over him? For heaven's sake, he's happy not knowing!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't want to make him miserable, I want to put him on his guard!\" retorted Mr. Weasley. \"You know what Harry and Ron are like, wandering off by themselves -- they've ended up in the Forbidden Forest twice! But Harry mustn't do that this year! When I think what could have happened to him that night he ran away from home! If the Knight Bus hadn't picked him up, I'm prepared to bet he would have been dead before the Ministry found him.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But he's not dead, he's fine, so what's the point\n\u3000\u3000\"Molly, they say Sirius Black's mad, and maybe he is, but he was clever enough to escape from Azkaban, and that's supposed to be impossible. It's been three weeks, and no one's seen hide nor hair of him, and I don't care what Fudge keeps telling the Daily Prophet, we're no nearer catching Black than inventing self-spelling wands. The only thing we know for sure is what Black's after\n\u3000\u3000\"But Harry will be perfectly safe at Hogwarts.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We thought Azkaban was perfectly safe. If Black can break out of Azkaban, he can break into Hogwarts.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But no one's really sure that Black's after Harry\n\u3000\u3000There was a thud on wood, and Harry was sure Mr. Weasley had banged his fist on the table.\n\u3000\u3000\"Molly, how many times do I have to tell you? They didn't report it in the press because Fudge wanted it kept quiet, but Fudge went out to Azkaban the night Black escaped. The guards told Fudge that Blacks been talking in his sleep for a while now. Always the same words: 'He's at Hogwarts... he's at Hogwarts.' Black is deranged, Molly, and he wants Harry dead. If you ask me, he thinks murdering Harry will bring You-Know-Who back to pow er. Black lost everything the night Harry stopped You- Know-Who, and he's had twelve years alone in Azkaban to brood on that....\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a silence. Harry leaned still closer to the door, desperate to hear more.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, Arthur, you must do what you think is right. But you're forgetting Albus Dumbledore. I don't think anything could hurt Harry at Hogwarts while Dumbledore's headmaster. I suppose he knows about all this?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Of course he knows. We had to ask him if he minds the Azkaban guards stationing themselves around the entrances to the school grounds. He wasn't happy about it, but he agreed.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Not happy? Why shouldn't he be happy, if they're there to catch Black?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Dumbledore isn't fond of the Azkaban guards,\" said Mr. Weasley heavily. \"Nor am 1, if it comes to that... but when you're dealing with a wizard like Black, you sometimes have to join forces with those you'd rather avoid.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"If they save Harry then I will never say another word against them, said Mr. Weasley wearily. \"It's late, Molly, we'd better go up....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry heard chairs move. As quietly as he could, he hurried down the passage to the bar and out of sight. The parlor door opened, and a few seconds later footsteps told him that Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were climbing the stairs.\n\u3000\u3000The bottle of rat tonic was lying under the table they had sat at earlier. Harry waited until he heard Mr. and Mrs. Weasley's bedroom door close, then headed back upstairs with the bottle.\n\u3000\u3000Fred and George were crouching in the shadows on the landing, heaving with laughter as they listened to Percy dismantling his and Ron's room in search of his badge.\n\u3000\u3000\"We've got it,\" Fred whispered to Harry. \"We've been improving it.\"\n\u3000\u3000The badge now read Bighead Boy.\n\u3000\u3000Harry forced a laugh, went to give Ron the rat tonic, then shut himself in his room and lay down on his bed.\n\u3000\u3000So Sirius Black was after him. This explained everything. Fudge had been lenient with him because he was so relieved to find him alive. He'd made Harry promise to stay in Diagon Alley where there were plenty of wizards to keep an eye on him. And he was sending two Ministry cars to take them all to the station tomorrow, so that the Weasleys could look after Harry until he was on the train.\n\u3000\u3000Harry lay listening to the muffled shouting next door and wondered why he didn't feel more scared. Sirius Black had murdered thirteen people with one curse; Mr. and Mrs, Weasley obviously thought Harry would be panic-stricken if he knew the truth. But Harry happened to agree wholeheartedly with Mrs. Weasley that the safest place on earth was wherever Albus Dumbledore happened to be. Didn't people always say that Dumbledore was the only person Lord Voldemort had ever been afraid of? Surely Black, as Voldemort's right-hand man, would be just as frightened of him?\n\u3000\u3000And then there were these Azkaban guards everyone kept talking about. They seemed to scare most people senseless, and if they were stationed all around the school, Black's chances of getting inside seemed very remote.\n\u3000\u3000No, all in all, the thing that bothered Harry most was the fact that his chances of visiting Hogsmeade now looked like zero. Nobody would want Harry to leave the safety of the castle until Black was caught; in fact, Harry suspected his every move would be carefully watched until the danger had passed.\n\u3000\u3000He scowled at the dark ceiling. Did they think he couldn't look after himself? He'd escaped Lord Voldemort three times; he wasn't completely useless....\n\u3000\u3000Unbidden, the image of the beast in the shadows of Magnolia Crescent crossed his mind. What to do when you know the worst is coming...\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm not going to be murdered,\" Harry said out loud.\n\u3000\u3000\"That's the spirit, dear,\" said his mirror sleepily.\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER FIVE\n\u3000\u3000THE DEMENTOR\n\u3000\u3000Tom woke Harry the next morning with his usual toothless grin and a cup of tea. Harry got dressed and was just persuading a disgruntled Hedwig to get back into her cage when Ron banged his way into the room, pulling a sweatshirt over his head and looking irritable.\n\u3000\u3000\"The sooner we get on the train, the better,\" he said. \"At least I can get away from Percy at Hogwarts. Now he's accusing me of dripping tea on his photo of Penelope Clearwater. You know,\" Ron grimaced, \"his girlfriend. She's hidden her face under the frame because her nose has gone all blotchy...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I've got something to tell you,\" Harry began, but they were interrupted by Fred and George, who had looked in to congratulate Ron on infuriating Percy again.\n\u3000\u3000They headed down to breakfast, where Mr. Weasley was reading the front page of the Daily Prophet with a furrowed brow and Mrs. Weasley was telling Hermione and Ginny about a love potion she'd made as a young girl. All three of them were rather giggly.\n\u3000\u3000\"What were you saying?\" Ron asked Harry as they sat down.\n\u3000\u3000\"Later,\" Harry muttered as Percy stormed in.\n\u3000\u3000Harry had no chance to speak to Ron or Hermione in the chaos of leaving; they were too busy heaving all their trunks down the Leaky Cauldron's narrow staircase and piling them up near the door, with Hedwig and Hermes, Percy's screech owl, perched on top in their cages. A small wickerwork basket stood beside the heap of trunks, spitting loudly.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's all right, Crookshanks,\" Hermione cooed through the wickerwork. \"I'll let you out on the train.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You won't,\" snapped Ron. \"What about poor Scabbers, eh?\"\n\u3000\u3000He pointed at his chest, where a large lump indicated that Scabbers was curled up in his pocket.\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Weasley, who had been outside waiting for the Ministry cars, stuck his head inside.\n\u3000\u3000\"They're here, he said. \"Harry, come on.\"\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Weasley marched Harry across the short stretch of pavement toward the first of two old- fashioned dark green cars, each of which was driven by a furtive-looking wizard wearing a suit of emerald velvet.\n\u3000\u3000\"In you get, Harry,\" said Mr. Weasley, glancing up and down the crowded street.\n\u3000\u3000Harry got into the back of the car and was shortly joined by Hermione, Ron, and, to Ron's disgust, Percy.\n\u3000\u3000The journey to King's Cross was very uneventful compared with Harry's trip on the Knight Bus. The Ministry of Magic cars seemed almost ordinary. though Harry noticed that they could slide through gaps that Uncle Vernon's new company car certainly couldn't have managed. They reached King's Cross with twenty minutes to spare; the Ministry drivers found them trolleys, unloaded their trunks, touched their hats in salute to Mr. Weasley, and drove away, somehow managing to jump to the head of an unmoving line at the traffic lights.\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Weasley kept close to Harry's elbow all the way into the station.\n\u3000\u3000\"Right then,\" he said, glancing around them. \"Let's do this in pairs, as there are so many of us. I'll go through first with Harry.\"\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Weasley strolled toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten, pushing Harry's trolley and apparently very interested in the InterCity 125 that had just arrived at platform nine. With a meaningful look at Harry, he leaned casually against the barrier. Harry imitated him.\n\u3000\u3000In a moment, they had fallen sideways through the solid metal onto platform nine and three- quarters and looked up to see the Hogwarts Express, a scarlet steam engine, puffing smoke over a platform packed with witches and wizards seeing their children onto the train.\n\u3000\u3000Percy and Ginny suddenly appeared behind Harry. They were panting and had apparently taken the barrier at a run.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah, there's Penelope!\" said Percy, smoothing his hair and going Pink again. Ginny caught Harry's eye, and they both turned away to hide their laughter as Percy strode over to a girl with long, curly hair, walking with his chest thrown out so that she couldn't miss his shiny badge. stood back to let him on. They leaned out of the window and waved at Mr. and Mrs. Weasley until the train turned a corner and blocked them from view.\n\u3000\u3000\"I need to talk to you in private,\" Harry muttered to Ron and Hermione as the train picked up speed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Go away, Ginny,\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, that's nice,\" said Ginny huffily, and she stalked off.\n\u3000\u3000Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off down the corridor, looking for an empty compartment, but all were full except for the one at the very end of the train.\n\u3000\u3000This had only one occupant, a man sitting fast asleep next to the window. Harry, Ron, and Hermione checked on the threshold. The Hogwarts Express was usually reserved for students and they had never seen an adult there before, except for the witch who pushed the food cart.\n\u3000\u3000The stranger was wearing an extremely shabby set of wizard's robes that had been darned in several places. He looked ill and exhausted. Though quite young, his light brown hair was flecked with gray.\n\u3000\u3000\"Who d'you reckon he is?\" Ron hissed as they sat down and slid the door shut, taking the seats farthest away from the window.\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor R. J. Lupin,\" whispered Hermione at once.\n\u3000\u3000\"How d'you know that?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It's on his case,\" she replied, pointing at the luggage rack over the man's head, where there was a small, battered case held together with a large quantity of neatly knotted string. The name Professor R. J. Lupin was stamped across one corner in peeling letters.\n\u3000\u3000\"Wonder what he teaches?\" said Ron, frowning at Professor Lupin's pallid profile.\n\u3000\u3000\"That's obvious,\" whispered Hermione. \"There's only one vacancy, isn't there? Defense Against the Dark Arts.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry, Ron, and Hermione had already had two Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers, both of whom had lasted only one year. There were rumors that the job was jinxed.\n\u3000\u3000\"well, I hope he's up to it,\" said Ron doubtfully. \"He looks like on, good hex would finish him off, doesn't he? Anyway...\" He turned to Harry. \"What were you going to tell us?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry explained all about Mr. and Mrs. Weasley's argument and the warning Mr. Weasley had just given him. \\When he'd finished, Ron looked thunderstruck, and Hermione had her hands over her mouth. She finally lowered them to say, \"Sirius Black escaped to come after you? Oh, Harry... you'll have to be really, really careful. don't go looking for trouble, Harry --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I Don't go looking for trouble,\" said Harry, nettled. \"Trouble usually finds me.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"How thick would Harry have to be, to go looking for a nutter who wants to kill him?\" said Ron shakily.\n\u3000\u3000They were taking the news worse than Harry had expected. Both Ron and Hermione seemed to be much more frightened of Black than he was.\n\u3000\u3000\"No one knows how he got out of Azkaban,\" said Ron uncomfortably. \"No one's ever done it before. And he was a top-security prisoner too.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But they'll catch him, won't they?\" said Hermione earnestly. \"I Mean, they've got all the Muggles looking out for him too....\" \"What's that noise?\" said Ron suddenly.\n\u3000\u3000A faint, tinny sort of whistle was coming from somewhere. The, looked all around the compartment.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's coming from your trunk, Harry,\" said Ron, standing UP and reaching into the luggage rack. A moment later he had pulled the Pocket Sneakoscope out from between Harry's robes. It was spinning very fast in the palm of Ron's hand and glowing brilliantly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Is that a Sneakoscope?\" said Hermione interestedly, standing up for a better look.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah... mind you, it's a very cheap one,\" Ron said. \"It went haywire just as I was tying it to Errol's leg to send it to Harry.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Were you doing anything untrustworthy at the time?\" said Hermione shrewdly.\n\u3000\u3000\"No! Well... I wasn't supposed to be using Errol. You know he's not really up to long journeys... but how else was I supposed to get Harry's present to him?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Stick it back in the trunk,\" Harry advised as the Sneakoscope whistled piercingly, \"or it'll wake him up.\"\n\u3000\u3000He nodded toward Professor Lupin. Ron stuffed the Sneakoscope into a particularly horrible pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks, which deadened the sound, then closed the lid of the trunk on it.\n\u3000\u3000\"We could get it checked in Hogsmeade,\" said Ron, sitting back down. \"They sell that sort of thing in Dervish and Banges, magical instruments and stuff. Fred and George told me.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Do you know much about Hogsmeade?\" asked Hermione keenly. \"I've read it's the only entirely non-Muggle settlement in Britain --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, I think it is,\" said Ron in an offhand sort of way.\n\u3000\u3000\"But that's not Why I want to go. I just want to get inside Honey Dukes.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What's that?\" said Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's this sweetshop,\" said Ron, a dreamy look coming over his face, \"where they've got everything... Pepper Imps -- they make you smoke at the mouth -- and great fat Chocoballs full of strawberry mousse and clotted cream, and really excellent sugar quills, which you can suck in class and just look like you're thinking what to write next --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But Hogsmeade's a very interesting place, isn't it?\" Hermione pressed on eagerly. \"In Sites of Historical Sorcery it says the inn was the headquarters for the 1612 goblin rebellion, and the Shrieking Shades supposed to be the most severely haunted building in Britain --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"-- and massive sherbert balls that make you levitate a few inches off the ground while you're sucking them,\" said Ron, who was plainly not listening to a word Hermione was saying.\n\u3000\u3000Hermione looked around at Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Won't it be nice to get out of school for a bit and explore Hogsmeade?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"'Spect it will,\" said Harry heavily. \"You'll have to tell me when You've found out.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What d'you mean?\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"I can't go. The Dursleys didn't sign my permission form, and Fudge wouldn't either.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron looked horrified.\n\u3000\u3000\"\"You're not allowed to come? But -- no way -- McGonagall or someone will give you permission -- \" musclely; Crabbe was taller, with a pudding-bowl haircut and a very thick neck; Goyle had short, bristly hair and long, gorilla-ish arms.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, look who it is,\" said Malfoy in his usual lazy drawl, pulling open the compartment door. \"Potty and the Weasel.\"\n\u3000\u3000Crabbe and Goyle chuckled trollishly.\n\u3000\u3000\"I heard your father finally got his hands on some gold this summer, Weasley,\" said Malfoy. \"Did your mother die of shock?\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron stood up so quickly he knocked Crookshanks's basket to the floor. Professor Lupin gave a snort.\n\u3000\u3000\"Who's that?\" said Malfoy, taking an automatic step backward as he spotted Lupin.\n\u3000\u3000\"New teacher,\" said Harry, who got to his feet, too, in case he needed to hold Ron back. \"What were you saying, Malfoy?\"\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy's pale eyes narrowed; he wasn't fool enough to pick a fight right under a teacher's nose.\n\u3000\u3000\"C'mon,\" he muttered resentfully to Crabbe and Goyle, and they disappeared.\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron sat down again, Ron massaging his knuckles.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm not going to take any crap from Malfoy this year,\" he said angrily. \"I mean it. If he makes one more crack about my family, I'm going to get hold of his head and --\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron made a violent gesture in midair.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron,\" hissed Hermione, pointing at Professor Lupin, \"be careful...\"\n\u3000\u3000But Professor Lupin was still fast asleep.\n\u3000\u3000The rain thickened as the train sped yet farther north; the windows were now a solid, shimmering gray, which graduily darkened until lanterns flickered into life all along the corridors and over the luggage racks. The train rattled, the rain hammered, the ind roared, but still, Professor Lupin slept.\n\u3000\u3000\"We must be nearly there,\" said Ron, leaning forward to look past Professor Lupin at the now completely black window.\n\u3000\u3000The words had hardly left him when the train started to slow down.\n\u3000\u3000\"Great,\" said Ron, getting up and walking carefully past Professor Lupin to try and see outside. \"I'm starving. I want to get to the feast....\n\u3000\u3000\"We can't be there yet,\" said Hermione, checking her watch.\n\u3000\u3000\"So why're we stopping?\"\n\u3000\u3000The train was getting slower and slower. As the noise of the pistons fell away, the wind and rain sounded louder than ever against the windows.\n\u3000\u3000Harry, who was nearest the door, got up to look into the corridor. All along the carriage, heads were sticking curiously out of their compartments.\n\u3000\u3000The train came to a stop with a jolt, and distant thuds and bangs told them that luggage had fallen out of the racks. Then, without warning, all the lamps went out and they were plunged into total darkness.\n\u3000\u3000\"'What's going on?\" said Ron's voice from behind Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ouch!\" gasped Hermione. \"Ron, that was my foot!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry felt his way back to his seat.\n\u3000\u3000\"D'you think we've broken down?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Dunno...\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a squeaking sound, and Harry saw the dim black outline of Ron, wiping a patch clean on the window and peering out.\n\u3000\u3000\"There's something moving out there,\" Ron said. \"I think people are coming aboard....\"\n\u3000\u3000The compartment door suddenly opened and someone fell painfully over Harry's legs.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sorry -- d'you know what's going on? -- Ouch -- sorry\n\u3000\u3000\"Hullo, Neville,\" said Harry, feeling around in the dark and pulling Neville up by his cloak.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry? Is that you? What's happening?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No idea -- sit down --\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a loud hissing and a yelp of pain; Neville had tried to sit on Crookshanks.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm going to go and ask the driver what's going on,\" came Hermione's voice. Harry felt her pass him, heard the door slide open again, and then a thud and two loud squeals of pain.\n\u3000\u3000\"Who's that?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Who's that?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ginny?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What are you doing?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I was looking for Ron --\" \"Come in and sit down --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Not here!\" said Harry hurriedly. \"I'm here!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ouch!\" said Neville.\n\u3000\u3000\"Quiet!\" said a hoarse voice suddenly.\n\u3000\u3000Professor Lupin appeared to have woken up at last. Harry could hear movements in his corner.\n\u3000\u3000None of them spoke.\n\u3000\u3000There was a soft, crackling noise, and a shivering light filled the compartment. Professor Lupin appeared to be holding a handful of flames. They illuminated his tired, gray face, but his eyes looked alert and wary.\n\u3000\u3000\"Stay where you are,\" he said in the same hoarse voice, and he got slowly to his feet with his handful of fire held out in front of him.\n\u3000\u3000But the door slid slowly open before Lupin could reach it.\n\u3000\u3000Standing in the doorway, illuminated by the shivering flames in Lupin's hand, was a cloaked figure that towered to the ceiling. Its face was completely hidden beneath its hood. Harry's eyes darted downward, and what he saw made his stomach contract. There was a hand protruding from the cloak and it was glistening, grayish, slimy-looking, and scabbed, like something dead that had decayed in water...\n\u3000\u3000But it was visible only for a split second. As though the creature beneath the cloak sensed Harry's gaze, the hand was suddenly withdrawn into the folds of its black cloak.\n\u3000\u3000And then the thing beneath the hood, whatever it was, drew a long, slow, rattling breath, as though it were trying to suck something more than air from its surroundings.\n\u3000\u3000An intense cold swept over them all. Harry felt his own breath catch in his chest. The cold went deeper than his skin. It was inside his chest, it was inside his very heart....\n\u3000\u3000Harry's eyes rolled up into his head. He couldn't see. He was drowning in cold. There was a rushing in his ears as though of water. He was being dragged downward, the roaring growing louder. .\n\u3000\u3000And then, from far away, he heard screaming, terrible, terrified, pleading screams. He wanted to help whoever it was, he tried to move his arms, but couldn't... a thick white fog was swirling around him, inside him -\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry! Harry! Are you all right?\"\n\u3000\u3000Someone was slapping his face.\n\u3000\u3000\"W -- what?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry opened his eyes; there were lanterns above him, and the floor was shaking -- the Hogwarts Express was moving again and the lights had come back on. He seemed to have slid out of his seat onto the floor. Ron and Hermione were kneeling next to him, and above them he could see Neville and Professor Lupin watching. Harry felt very sick; when he put up his hand to push his glasses back on, he felt cold sweat on his face.\n\u3000\u3000Ron and Hermione heaved him back onto his seat.\n\u3000\u3000\"Are you okay?\" Ron asked nervously.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah,\" said Harry, looking quickly toward the door. The hooded creature had vanished. \"What happened? Where's that -- that thing? Who screamed?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No one screamed,\" said Ron, more nervously still.\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked around the bright compartment. Ginny and Neville looked back at him, both very pale.\n\u3000\u3000\"But I heard screaming --\"\n\u3000\u3000A loud snap made them all jump. Professor Lupin was breaking an enormous slab of chocolate into pieces.\n\u3000\u3000\"Here,\" he said to Harry, handing him a particularly large piece. \"Eat it. It'll help.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry took the chocolate but didn't eat it.\n\u3000\u3000\"What was that thing?\" he asked Lupin.\n\u3000\u3000\"A dementor,\" said Lupin, who was now giving chocolate to everyone else. \"One of the dementors of Azkaban.\"\n\u3000\u3000Everyone stared at him. Professor Lupin crumpled up the empty chocolate wrapper and put it in his pocket.\n\u3000\u3000\"Eat,\" he repeated. \"It'll help. I need to speak to the driver, excuse me...\n\u3000\u3000He strolled past Harry and disappeared into the corridor.\n\u3000\u3000\"Are you sure you're okay, Harry?\" said Hermione, watching Harry anxiously.\n\u3000\u3000\"I Don't get it.... What happened?\" said Harry, wiping more sweat off his face.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well -- that thing -- the dementor -- stood there and looked around (I mean, I think it did, I couldn't see its face) -- and you -- you\n\u3000\u3000\"I thought you were having a fit or something,\" said Ron, who still looked scared. \"You went sort of rigid and fell out of your seat and started twitching -- 11\n\u3000\u3000\"And Professor Lupin stepped over you, and walked toward the dementor, and pulled out his wand,\" said Hermione, \"and he said, 'None of us is hiding Sirius Black under our cloaks. Go.' But the dementor didn't move, so Lupin muttered something, and a silvery thing shot out of his wand at it, and it turned around and sort of glided away.... \"\n\u3000\u3000\"It was horrible,\" said Neville, in a higher voice than usual. \"Did YOU feel how cold it got when it came in?\"\n\u3000\u3000I felt weird,\" said Ron, shifting his shoulders uncomfortably. \"Like I'd never be cheerful again....\"\n\u3000\u3000Ginny, who was huddled in her corner looking nearly as bad as Harry felt, gave a small sob; Hermione went over and put a comforting arm around her.\n\u3000\u3000\"But didn't any of you -- fall off your seats?\" said Harry awkwardly.\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Ron, looking anxiously at Harry again. \"Ginny was shaking like mad, though....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't understand. He felt weak and shivery, as though he were recovering from a bad bout of flu; he also felt the beginnings of shame. Why had he gone to pieces like that, when no one else had?\n\u3000\u3000Professor Lupin had come back. He paused as he entered, looked around, and said, with a small smile, \"I haven't poisoned that chocolate, you know....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry took a bite and to his great surprise felt warmth spread suddenly to the tips of his fingers and toes.\n\u3000\u3000\"We'll be at Hogwarts in ten minutes,\" said Professor Lupin. \"Are you all right, Harry?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't ask how Professor Lupin knew his name.\n\u3000\u3000\"Fine,\" he muttered, embarrassed.\n\u3000\u3000They didn't talk much during the remainder of the journey. At long last, the train stopped at Hogsmeade station, and there was a great scramble to get outside; owls hooted, cats meowed, and Neville's pet toad croaked loudly from under his hat. It was freezing on the tiny platform; rain was driving down in icy sheets.\n\u3000\u3000\"Firs' years this way!\" called a familiar voice. Harry, Ron, and Hermione turned and saw the gigantic outline of Hagrid at the other end of the platform, beckoning the terrified-looking new students forward for their traditional journey across the lake.\n\u3000\u3000\"All right, you three?\" Hagrid yelled over the heads of the crowd. They waved at him, but had no chance to speak to him because the mass of people around them was shunting them away along the platform. Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed the rest of the school along the platform and out onto a rough mud track, where at least a hundred stagecoaches awaited the remaining students, each pulled, Harry could only assume, by an invisible horse, because when they climbed inside and shut the door, the coach set off all by itself, bumping and swaying in procession.\n\u3000\u3000The coach smelled faintly of mold and straw. Harry felt better since the chocolate, but still weak. Ron and Hermione kept looking at him sideways, as though frightened he might collapse again.\n\u3000\u3000As the carriage trundled toward a pair of magnificent wrought iron gates, flanked with stone columns topped with winged boars,\n\u3000\u3000Harry saw two more towering, hooded dementors, standing guard on either side. A wave of cold sickness threatened to engulf him again; he leaned back into the lumpy seat and closed his eyes until they had passed the gates. The carriage picked up speed on the long, sloping drive up to the castle; Hermione was leaning out of the tiny window, watching the many turrets and towers draw nearer. At last, the carriage swayed to a halt, and Hermione and Ron got out.\n\u3000\u3000As Harry stepped down, a drawling, delighted voice sounded in his ear.\n\u3000\u3000\"You fainted, Potter? Is Longbottorn telling the truth? You actualy fainted?\"\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy elbowed past Hermione to block Harry's way up the stone steps to the castle, his face gleeful and his pale eyes glinting maliciously. \"Shove off, Malfoy,\" said Ron, whose jaw was clenched.\n\u3000\u3000\"Did you faint as well, Weasley?\" said Malfoy loudly. \"Did the scary old dementor frighten you too, Weasley?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Is there a problem?\" said a mild voice. Professor Lupin had just gotten out of the next carriage.\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy gave Professor Lupin an insolent stare, which took in the patches on his robes and the delapidated suitcase. With a tiny hint of sarcasm in his voice, he said, \"Oh, no -- er -- Professor,\" then he smirked at Crabbe and Goyle and led them up the steps into the castle.\n\u3000\u3000Hermione prodded Ron in the back to make him hurry, and the three of them joined the crowd swarming up the steps, through the giant oak front doors, into the cavernous entrance hall, which was lit with flaming torches, and housed a magnificent marble staircase that led to the upper floors.\n\u3000\u3000The door into the Great Hall stood open at the right; Harry followed the crowd toward it, but had barely glimpsed the enchanted ceiling, which was black and cloudy tonight, when a voice called, \"Potter! Granger! I want to see you both!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Hermione turned around, surprised. Professor McGonagall, Transfiguration teacher and head of Gryffindor House, was calling over the heads of the crowd. She was a sternlooking witch who wore her hair in a tight bun; her sharp eyes were framed with square spectacles. Harry fought his way over to her with a feeling of foreboding: Professor McGonagall had a way of making him feel he must have done something wrong.\n\u3000\u3000\"There's no need to look so worried -- I just want a word in MY office,\" she told them. \"Move along there, Weasley.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron stared as Professor McGonagall ushered Harry and Hermione away from the chattering crowd; they accompanied her across the entrance hall, up the marble staircase, and along a corridor.\n\u3000\u3000Once they were in her office, a small room with a large, welcoming fire, Professor McGonagall motioned Harry and Hermione to sit down. She settled herself behind her desk and said abruptly, \"Professor Lupin sent an owl ahead to say that you were taken ill on the train, Potter.\"\n\u3000\u3000Before Harry could reply, there was a soft knock on the door and Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, came bustling in.\n\u3000\u3000Harry felt himself going red in the face. It was bad enough that he'd passed out, or whatever he had done, without everyone making all this fuss.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm fine,\" he said, \"I don't need anything\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, it's you, is it?\" said Madam Pomfrey, ignoring this and bending down to stare closely at him. \"I suppose you've been doing something dangerous again?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It was a dementor, Poppy,\" said Professor McGonagall.\n\u3000\u3000They exchanged a dark look, and Madam Pomfrey clucked disapprovingly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Setting dementors around a school, she muttered, pushing back Harry's hair and feeling his forehead. \"He won't be the last one who collapses. Yes, he's all clammy. Terrible things, they are, and the effect they have on people who are already delicate\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm not delicate!\" said Harry crossly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Of course you're not,\" said Madam Pomfrey absentmindedly, now taking his pulse.\n\u3000\u3000\"What does he need?\" said Professor McGonagall crisply. \"Bed rest? Should he perhaps spend tonight in the hospital wing?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm fine!\" said Harry, jumping up. The thought of what Draco Malfoy would say if he had to go to the hospital wing was torture.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, he should have some chocolate, at the very least,\" said Madam Pomfrey, who was now trying to peer into Harry's eyes.\n\u3000\u3000\"I've already had some,\" said Harry. \"Professor Lupin gave me some. He gave it to all of us.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Did he, now?\" said Madam Pomfrey approvingly. \"So we've finally got a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who knows his remedies?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Are you sure you feel all right, Potter?\" Professor McGonagall said sharply.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes, \"said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Very well. Kindly wait outside while I have a quick word with Miss Granger about her course schedule, then we can go down to the feast together.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry went back into the corridor with Madam Pomfrey, who left for the hospital wing, muttering to herself He had to wait only a few minutes; then Hermione emerged looking very happy about something, followed by Professor McGonagall, and the three of them made their way back down the marble staircase to the Great Hall.\n\u3000\u3000It was a sea of pointed black hats; each of the long House tables was lined with students, their faces glimmering by the light of thousands of candles, which were floating over the tables in midair. Professor Flitwick, who was a tiny little wizard with a shock of white hair, was carrying an ancient hat and a three-legged stool out of the hall.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh,\" said Hermione softly, \"we've missed the Sorting!\"\n\u3000\u3000New students at Hogwarts were sorted into Houses by trying on the sorting Hat, which shouted out the House they were best suited to (Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, or Slytherin). Professor McGonagall strode off toward her empty seat at the staff table, and Harry and Hermione set off in the other direction, as quietly as possible, toward the Gryffindor table. People looked around at them as they passed along the back of the hall, and a few of them pointed at Harry. Had the story of his collapsing in front of the dementor traveled that fast?\n\u3000\u3000He and Hermione sat down on either side of Ron, who had saved them seats.\n\u3000\u3000\"What was all that about?\" he muttered to Harry.\n\u3000\u3000Harry started to explain in a whisper, but at that moment the headmaster stood up to speak, and he broke off.\n\u3000\u3000Professor Dumbledore, though very old, always gave an impression of great energy. He had several feet of long silver hair and beard, half-moon spectacles, and an extremely crooked nose. He was often described as the greatest wizard of the age, but that wasn't why Harry respected him. You couldn't help trusting Albus Dumbledore, and as Harry watched him beaming around at the students, he felt really calm for the first time since the dementor had entered the train compartment.\n\u3000\u3000\"Welcome!\" said Dumbledore, the candlelight shimmering on his beard. \"Welcome to another year at Hogwarts! I have a few things to say to you all, and as one of them is very serious, I think it best to get it out of the way before you become befuddled by our excellent feast....\"\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore cleared his throat and continued, \"As you will all be aware after their search of the Hogwarts Express, our school is presently playing host to some of the dementors of Azkaban, who are here on Ministry of Magic business.\"\n\u3000\u3000He paused, and Harry remembered what Mr. Weasley had said about Dumbledore not being happy with the dementors guarding the school.\n\u3000\u3000\"They are stationed at every entrance to the grounds,\" Dumbledore continued, \"and while they are with us, I must make it plain that nobody is to leave school without permission. Dementors are not to be fooled by tricks or disguises -- or even Invisibility Cloaks,\" he added blandly, and Harry and Ron glanced at each other. \"It is not in the nature of a dementor to understand pleading or excuses. I therefore warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you. I look to the prefects, and our new Head Boy and Girl, to make sure that no student runs afoul of the dementors,\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000Percy, who was sitting a few seats down from Harry, puffed out his chest again and stared around impressively. Dumbledore paused again; he looked very seriously around the hall, and nobody moved or made a sound.\n\u3000\u3000\"On a happier note,\" he continued, I am pleased to welcome two new teachers to our ranks this year.\n\u3000\u3000\"First, Professor Lupin, who has kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.\"\n\u3000\u3000There was some scattered, rather unenthusiastic applause. Only those who had been in the compartment on the train with Professor Lupin clapped hard, Harry among them. Professor Lupin looked particularly shabby next to all the other teachers in their best robes.\n\u3000\u3000\"Look at Snape!\" Ron hissed in Harry's ear.\n\u3000\u3000Professor Snape, the Potions master, was staring along the staff table at Professor Lupin. It was common knowledge that Snape ,anted the Defense Against the Dark Arts job, but even Harry, who hated Snape, was startled at the expression twisting his thin, sallow face. it was beyond anger: it was loathing. Harry knew that expression only too well; it was the look Snape wore every time he set eyes on Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"As to our second new appointment,\" Dumbledore continued as the lukewarm applause for Professor Lupin died away. \"Well, I am sorry to tell you that Professor Kettleburn, our Care of Magical Creatures teacher, retired at the end of last year in order to enjoy more time with his remaining limbs. However, I am delighted to say that his place will be filled by none other than Rubeus Hagrid, who has agreed to take on this teaching job in addition to his gamekeeping duties.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry, Ron, and Hermione stared at one another, stunned. Then they joined in with the applause, which was tumultuous at the Gryffindor table in particular. Harry leaned forward to see Hagrid, who was ruby-red in the face and staring down at his enormous hands, his wide grin hidden in the tangle of his black beard.\n\u3000\u3000\"We should've known!\" Ron roared, pounding the table. \"Who else would have assigned us a biting book?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry, Ron, and Hermione were the last to stop clapping, and as Professor Dumbledore started speaking again, they saw that Hagrid was wiping his eyes on the tablecloth.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, I think that's everything of importance,\" said Dumbledore. \"Let the feast begin!\"\n\u3000\u3000The golden plates and goblets before them filled suddenly with food and drink. Harry, suddenly ravenous, helped himself to everything he could reach and began to eat.\n\u3000\u3000It was a delicious feast; the hall echoed with talk, laughter, and the clatter of knives and forks. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, were eager for it to finish so that they could talk to Hagrid. They knew how much being made a teacher would mean to him. Hagrid wasn't a fully qualified wizard; he had been expelled from Hogwarts in his third year for a crime he had not committed. It had been Harry, Ron, and Hermione who had cleared Hagrid's name last year.\n\u3000\u3000At long last, when the last morsels of pumpkin tart had melted from the golden platters, Dumbledore gave the word that it was time for them all to go to bed, and they got their chance.\n\u3000\u3000\"Congratulations, Hagrid!\" Hermione squealed as they reached the teachers' table.\n\u3000\u3000\"All down ter you three,\" said Hagrid, wiping his shining face on his napkin as he looked up at them., \"Can' believe it... great man, Dumbledore... came straight down to me hut after Professor Kettleburn said he'd had enough.... It's what I always wanted. --\"\n\u3000\u3000Overcome with emotion, he buried his face in his napkin, and Professor McGonagall shooed them away.\n\u3000\u3000Harry, Ron, and Hermione joined the Gryffindors streaming up the marble staircase and, very tired now, along more corridors, UP more and more stairs, to the hidden entrance to Gryffindor Tower's large portrait of a fat lady in a pink dress asked them, \"Password?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Coming through, coming through!\" Percy called from behind the crowd. \"The new password's 'Fortuna Major'!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh no,\" said Neville Longbottom sadly. He always had trouble remembering the passwords.\n\u3000\u3000Through the portrait hole and across the common room, the girls and boys divided toward their separate staircases. Harry climbed the spiral stair with no thought in his head except how glad he was to be back. They reached their familiar, circular dormitory with its five four-poster beds, and Harry, looking around, felt he was home at last.\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER SIX\n\u3000\u3000TALONS AND TEA LEAVES\n\u3000\u3000When Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered the Great Hall for breakfast the next day, the first thing they saw was Draco Malfoy, who seemed to be entertaining a large group of Slytherins with a very funny story. As they passed, Malfoy did a ridiculous impression of a swooning fit and there was a roar of laughter.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ignore him,\" said Hermione, who was right behind Harry. \"Just ignore him, it's not worth it....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hey, Potter!\" shrieked Pansy Parkinson, a Slytherin girl with a face like a pug. \"Potter! The dementors are coming, Potter! Woooooooooo!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry dropped into a seat at the Gryffindor table, next to George Weasley.\n\u3000\u3000\"New third-year course schedules,\" said George, passing then, over. \"What's up with you, Harry?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Malfoy,\" said Ron, sitting down on George's other side and glaring over at the Slytherin table.\n\u3000\u3000George looked up in time to see Malfoy pretending to faint with terror again.\n\u3000\u3000\"That little git,\" he said calmly. \"He wasn't so cocky last night when the dementors were down at our end of the train. Came runing into our compartment, didn't he, Fred?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Nearly wet himself,\" said Fred, with a contemptuous glance at Malfoy.\n\u3000\u3000\"I wasn't too happy myself,\" said George. \"They're horrible things, those dementors....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Sort of freeze your insides, don't they?\" said Fred.\n\u3000\u3000\"You didn't pass out, though, did you?\" said Harry in a low voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"Forget it, Harry,\" said George bracingly. \"Dad had to go out to Azkaban one time, remember, Fred? And he said it was the worst place he'd ever been, he came back all weak and shaking.... They suck the happiness out of a place, dementors. Most of the prisoners go mad in there.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Anyway, we'll see how happy Malfoy looks after our first Quidditch match,\" said Fred. \"Gryffindor versus Slytherin, first game of the season, remember?\"\n\u3000\u3000The only time Harry and Malfoy had faced each other in a Quidditch match, Malfoy had definitely come off worse. Feeling slightly more cheerful, Harry helped himself to sausages and fried tomatoes.\n\u3000\u3000Hermione was examining her new schedule.\n\u3000\u3000\" Ooh, good, we're starting some new subjects today,\" she said happily. villains are these, that trespass upon my private lands! Come I. scorn at my fall, perchance? Draw, you knaves, you dogs!\"\n\u3000\u3000They watched in astonishment as the little knight tugged his sword out of its scabbard and began brandishing it violently, hopping up and down in rage. But the sword was too long for him; a particularly wild swing made him overbalance, and he landed facedown in the grass.\n\u3000\u3000\"Are you all right?\" said Harry, moving closer to the picture.\n\u3000\u3000\"Get back, you scurvy braggart! Back, you rogue!\"\n\u3000\u3000The knight seized his sword again and used it to push himself back up, but the blade sank deeply into the grass and, though he pulled with all his might, he couldn't get it out again. Finally, he had to flop back down onto the grass and push up his visor to mop his sweating face.\n\u3000\u3000\"Listen,\" said Harry, taking advantage of the knight's exhaustion, \"we're looking for the North Tower. You don't know the way, do you?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"A quest!\" The knight's rage seemed to vanish instantly. He clanked to his feet and shouted, \"Come follow me, dear friends, and we shall find our goal, or else shall perish bravely in the charge!\"\n\u3000\u3000He gave the sword another fruitless tug, tried and failed to mount the fat pony, gave up, and cried, \"On foot then, good sirs and gentle lady! On! On!\"\n\u3000\u3000And he ran, clanking loudly, into the left side of the frame and out of sight.\n\u3000\u3000They hurried after him along the corridor, following the sound of his armor. Every now and then they spotted him running through a picture ahead.\n\u3000\u3000\"Be of stout heart, the worst is yet to come!\" yelled the knight, and they saw him reappear in front of an alarmed group of women in crinolines, whose picture hung on the wall of a narrow spiral staircase.\n\u3000\u3000Puffing loudly, Harry, Ron, and Hermione climbed the tightly spiraling steps, getting dizzier and dizzier, until at last they heard the murmur of voices above them and knew they had reached the classroom.\n\u3000\u3000\"Farewell!\" cried the knight, popping his head into a painting of some sinister-looking monks. \"Farewell, my comrades-in-arms! If ever you have need of noble heart and steely sinew, call upon Sir Cadogan!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, we'll call you,\" muttered Ron as the knight disappeared, \"if we ever need someone mental.\"\n\u3000\u3000They climbed the last few steps and emerged onto a tiny landing, where most of the class was already assembled. There were no doors off this landing, but Ron nudged Harry and pointed at the ceiling, where there was a circular trapdoor with a brass plaque on it.\n\u3000\u3000\"'Sibyll Trelawney, Divination teacher,\"' Harry read. \"How're we supposed to get up there?\"\n\u3000\u3000As though in answer to his question, the trapdoor suddenly opened, and a silvery ladder descended right at Harry's feet. Everyone got quiet.\n\u3000\u3000\"After you,\" said Ron, grinning, so Harry climbed the ladder first.\n\u3000\u3000He emerged into the strangest-looking classroom he had ever seen. In fact, it didn't look like a classroom at all, more like a cross between someone's attic and an old-fashioned tea shop. At leasttwenty small, circular tables were crammed inside it, all surrounded by chintz armchairs and fat little poufs. Everything was lit with a dim, crimson light; the curtains at the windows were all closed, and the many lamps were draped with dark red scarves. it was stiflingly warm, and the fire that was burning under the crowded mantelpiece was giving off a heavy, sickly sort of perfume as it heated a large copper kettle. The shelves running around the circular walls were crammed with dusty-looking feathers, stubs of candles, many packs of tattered playing cards, countless silvery crystal balls, and a huge array of teacups.\n\u3000\u3000Ron appeared at Harry's shoulder as the class assembled around them, all talking in whispers.\n\u3000\u3000\"Where is she?\" Ron said.\n\u3000\u3000A voice came suddenly out of the shadows, a soft, misty sort of voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"Welcome,\" it said. \"How nice to see you in the physical world at last.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry's immediate impression was of a large, glittering insect. Professor Trelawney moved into the firelight, and they saw that she was very thin; her large glasses magnified her eyes to several times their natural size, and she was draped in a gauzy spangled shawl. Innumerable chains and beads hung around her spindly neck, and her arms and hands were encrusted with bangles and rings.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sit, my children, sit,\" she said, and they all climbed awkwardly into armchairs or sank onto poufs. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat themselves around the same round table.\n\u3000\u3000\"Welcome to Divination,\" said Professor Trelawney, who had seated herself in a winged armchair in front of the fire. \"My name is professor Trelawney. You may not have seen me before. I find that descending too often into the hustle and bustle of the main school clouds my Inner Eye.\"\n\u3000\u3000Nobody said anything to this extraordinary pronouncement. Professor Trelawney delicately rearranged her shawl and continued, \"So you have chosen to study Divination, the most difficult of all magical arts. I must warn you at the outset that if you do not have the Sight, there is very little I will be able to teach you.. Books can take you only so far in this field....\"\n\u3000\u3000At these words, both Harry and Ron glanced, grinning, at Hermione, who looked startled at the news that books wouldn't be much help in this subject.\n\u3000\u3000\"Many witches and wizards, talented though they are in the area of loud bangs and smells and sudden disappearings, are yet unable to penetrate the veiled mysteries of the future,\" Professor Trelawney went on, her enormous, gleaming eyes moving from face to nervous face. \"It is a Gift granted to few. You, boy,\" she said suddenly to Neville, who almost toppled off his pouf. \"Is your grandmother well?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I think so,\" said Neville tremulously.\n\u3000\u3000\"I wouldn't be so sure if I were you, dear,\" said Professor Trelawney, the firelight glinting on her long emerald earrings. Neville gulped. Professor Trelawney continued placidly. \"We will be covering the basic methods of Divination this year. The first term will be devoted to reading the tea leaves. Next term we shall progress to palmistry. By the way, my dear,\" she shot suddenly at Parvati Patil, \"beware a red-haired man.\"\n\u3000\u3000Parvati gave a startled look at Ron, who was right behind her and edged her chair away from him.\n\u3000\u3000\"In the second term,\" Professor Trelawney went on, \"we shall progress to the crystal ball -- if we have finished with fire omens, that is. Unfortunately, classes will be disrupted in February by a nasty bout of flu. I myself will lose my voice. And around Easter, one of our number will leave us forever.\"\n\u3000\u3000A very tense silence followed this pronouncement, but Professor Trelawney seemed unaware of it.\n\u3000\u3000\"I wonder, dear,\" she said to Lavender Brown, who was nearest and shrank back in her chair, \"if you could pass me the largest silver teapot?\"\n\u3000\u3000Lavender, looking relieved, stood up, took an enormous teapot from the shelf, and put it down on the table in front of Professor Trelawney.\n\u3000\u3000\"Thank you, my dear. Incidentally, that thing you are dreading -- it will happen on Friday the sixteenth of October.\"\n\u3000\u3000Lavender trembled.\n\u3000\u3000\"Now, I want you all to divide into pairs. Collect a teacup from the shelf, come to me, and I will fill it. Then sit down and drink, drink until only the dregs remain. Swill these around the cup three times with the left hand, then turn the cup upside down on its saucer, wait for the last of the tea to drain away, then give your cup to your partner to read. You will interpret the patterns using pages five and six of Unfogging the Future. I shall move among you, helping and instructing. Oh, and dear\" -- she caught Neville by the arm as he made to stand up -- \"after you've broken your first cup, would you be so kind as to select one of the blue patterned ones? I'm rather attached to the pink.\"\n\u3000\u3000Sure enough, Neville had no sooner reached the shelf of teacups when there was a tinkle of breaking china. Professor Trelawney swept over to him holding a dustpan and brush and said, \"One of the blue ones, then, dear, if you wouldn't mind... thank you. ... \"\n\u3000\u3000When Harry and Ron had had their teacups filled, they went back to their table and tried to drink the scalding tea quickly. They swilled the dregs around as Professor Trelawney had instructed, then drained the cups and swapped over.\n\u3000\u3000\"Right,\" said Ron as they both opened their books at pages five and six. \"What can you see in mine?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"A load of soggy brown stuff,\" said Harry. The heavily perfumed smoke in the room was making him feel sleepy and stupid.\n\u3000\u3000\"Broaden your minds, my dears, and allow your eyes to see past the mundane!\" Professor Trelawney cried through the gloom.\n\u3000\u3000Harry tried to pull himself together.\n\u3000\u3000\"Right, you've got a crooked sort of cross... \" He consulted Unfogging the Future. \"That means you're going to have 'trials and suffering' -- sorry about that -- but there's a thing that could be the sun... hang on... that means 'great happiness'... so you're going to suffer but be very happy....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You need your Inner Eye tested, if you ask me,\" said Ron, and they both had to stifle their laughs as Professor Trelawney gazed in their direction.\n\u3000\u3000\"My turn...\" Ron peered into Harry's teacup, his forehead wrinkled with effort. \"There's a blob a bit like a bowler hat,\" he said. \"Maybe you're going to work for the Ministry of Magic...\n\u3000\u3000He turned the teacup the other way up.\n\u3000\u3000\"But this way it looks more like an acorn.... What's that?\" He scanned his copy of Unfogging the Future. \"'A windfall, unexpected gold.' Excellent, you can lend me some... and there's a thin, here,\" he turned the cup again, \"that looks like an animal... yeah, if that was its head... it looks like a hippo... no, a sheep...\"\n\u3000\u3000Professor Trelawney whirled around as Harry let out a snort of laughter.\n\u3000\u3000\"Let me see that, my dear,\" she said reprovingly to Ron, sweeping over and snatching Harry's cup from him. Everyone went quiet to watch.\n\u3000\u3000Professor Trelawney was staring into the teacup, rotating it counterclockwise.\n\u3000\u3000\"The falcon... my dear, you have a deadly enemy.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But everyone knows that, \" said Hermione in a loud whisper. Professor Trelawney stared at her.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, they do,\" said Hermione. \"Everybody knows about Harry and You-Know-Who.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron stared at her with a mixture of amazement and admiration. They had never heard Hermione speak to a teacher like that before. Professor Trelawney chose not to reply. She lowered her huge eyes to Harry's cup again and continued to turn it.\n\u3000\u3000\"The club... an attack. Dear, dear, this is not a happy cup....\n\u3000\u3000I thought that was a bowler hat,\" said Ron sheepishly.\n\u3000\u3000\"The skull... danger in your path, my dear....\"\n\u3000\u3000Everyone was staring, transfixed, at Professor Trelawney, who gave the cup a final turn, gasped, and then screamed.\n\u3000\u3000There was another tinkle of breaking china; Neville had smashed his second cup. Professor Trelawney sank into a vacant armchair, her glittering hand at her heart and her eyes closed.\n\u3000\u3000\"My dear boy... my poor, dear boy no it is kinder not to say.. . no... don't ask me....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What is it, Professor?\" said Dean Thomas at once. Everyone had got to their feet, and slowly they crowded around Harry and Ron's table, pressing close to Professor Trelawney's chair to get a\n\u3000\u3000good look at Harry's cup.\n\u3000\u3000\"My dear,\" Professor Trelawney's huge eyes opened dramatically,\n\u3000\u3000\"You have the Grim.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"The what?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000He could tell that he wasn't the only one who didn't understand; Dean Thomas shrugged at him and Lavender Brown looked puzzled, but nearly everybody else clapped their hands to their mouths in horror.\n\u3000\u3000\"The Grim, my dear, the Grim!\" cried Professor Trelawney, who looked shocked that Harry hadn't understood. \"The giant, spectral dog that haunts churchyards! My dear boy, it is an omen -- the worst omen -- of death!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry's stomach lurched. That dog on the cover of Death Omens in Flourish and Blotts -the dog in the shadows of Magnolia Crescent... Lavender Brown clapped her hands to her mouth too. Everyone was looking at Harry, everyone except Hermione, who had gotten up and moved around to the back of Professor Trelawney's chair.\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't think it looks like a Grim,\" she said flatly.\n\u3000\u3000Professor Trelawney surveyed Hermione with mounting dislike.\n\u3000\u3000\"You'll forgive me for saying so, my dear, but I perceive very little aura around you. Very little receptivity to the resonances of the future.\" Seamus Finnigan was tilting his head from side to side.\n\u3000\u3000\"It looks like a Grim if you do this,\" he said, with his eyes almost shut, \"but it looks more like a donkey from here,\" he said, leaning to the left.\n\u3000\u3000\"When you've all finished deciding whether I'm going to die Or not!\" said Harry, taking even himself by surprise. Now nobody seemed to want to look at him.\n\u3000\u3000\"I think we will leave the lesson here for today,\" said Professor Trelawney in her mistiest voice. \"Yes... please pack away your things....\"\n\u3000\u3000Silently the class took their teacups back to Professor Trelawney, packed away their books, and closed their bags. Even Ron was avoiding Harry's eyes.\n\u3000\u3000\"Until we meet again,\" said Professor Trelawney faintly, \"fair fortune be yours. Oh, and dear\" -- she pointed at Neville -- \"you'll be late next time, so mind you work extra-hard to catch up.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry, Ron, and Hermione descended Professor Trelawney's ladder and the winding stair in silence, then set off for Professor McGonagall's Transfiguration lesson. It took them so long to find her classroom that, early as they had left Divination, they were only just in time.\n\u3000\u3000Harry chose a seat right at the back of the room, feeling as though he were sitting in a very bright spotlight; the rest of the class kept shooting furtive glances at him, as though he were about to drop dead at any moment. He hardly heard what Professor McGonagall was telling them about Animagi (wizards who could transform at will into animals), and wasn't even watching when she transformed herself in front of their eyes into a tabby cat with spectacle markings around her eyes.\n\u3000\u3000\"Really, what has got into you all today?\" said Professor McGonagall, turning back into herself with a faint pop, and staring around at them all. \"Not that it matters, but that's the first time my transformation's not got applause from a class.\"\n\u3000\u3000Everybody's heads turned toward Harry again, but nobody spoke. Then Hermione raised her hand.\n\u3000\u3000\"Please, Professor, we've just had our first Divination class, and we were reading the tea leaves, and --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah, of course,\" said Professor McGonagall, suddenly frowning.\n\u3000\u3000\"There is no need to say any more, Miss Granger. Tell me, which of you will be dying this year?\"\n\u3000\u3000Everyone stared at her.\n\u3000\u3000\"Me,\" said Harry, finally.\n\u3000\u3000\"I see,\" said Professor McGonagall, fixing Harry with her beady eyes. \"Then you should know, Potter, that Sibyll Trelawney has predicted the death of one student a year since she arrived at this school. None of them has died yet. Seeing death omens is her favorite way of greeting a new class. If it were not for the fact that I never speak ill of my colleagues --\"\n\u3000\u3000Professor McGonagall broke off, and they saw that her nostrils had gone white. She went on, more calmly, \"Divination is one of the most imprecise branches of magic. I shall not conceal from you that I have very little patience with it. True Seers are very rare, and Professor Trelawney --\"\n\u3000\u3000She stopped again, and then said, in a very matter-of-fact tone, \"You look in excellent health to me, Potter, so you will excuse me if I don't let you off homework today. I assure you that if you die, you need not hand it in.\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione laughed. Harry felt a bit better. It was harder to feel scared of a lump of tea leaves away from the dim red light and befuddling perfume of Professor Trelawney's classroom. Not everyone was convinced, however. Ron still looked worried, and Lavender whispered, \"But what about Neville's cup?\"\n\u3000\u3000When the Transfiguration class had finished, they joined the crowd thundering toward the Great Hall for lunch.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron, cheer up,\" said Hermione, pushing a dish of stew toward him. \"You heard what Professor McGonagall said.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron spooned stew onto his plate and picked up his fork but didn't start.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry,\" he said, in a low, serious voice, \"You haven't seen a great black dog anywhere, have you?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, I have,\" said Harry. \"I saw one the night I left the Dursleys'. \"\n\u3000\u3000Ron let his fork fall with a clatter.\n\u3000\u3000\"Probably a stray,\" said Hermione calmly.\n\u3000\u3000Ron looked at Hermione as though she had gone mad.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione, if Harry's seen a Grim, that's -- that's bad,\" he said. \"My -- my uncle Bilius saw one and -- and he died twenty-four hours later!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Coincidence,\" said Hermione airily, pouring herself some pumpkin juice.\n\u3000\u3000\"You don't know what you're talking about!\" said Ron, starting to get angry. \"Grims scare the living daylights out of most wizards!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"There you are, then,\" said Hermione in a superior tone. \"They see the Grim and die of fright. The Grim's not an omen, it's the cause of death! And Harry's still with us because he's not stupid enough to see one and think, right, well, I'd better kick the bucket then!\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron mouthed wordlessly at Hermione, who opened her bag, took out her new Arithmancy book, and propped it open against the juice jug.\n\u3000\u3000\"I think Divination seems very woolly,\" she said, searching for her page. \"A lot of guesswork, if you ask me.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"There was nothing woolly about the Grim in that cup!\" said Ron hotly.\n\u3000\u3000\"You didn't seem quite so confident when you were telling Harry it was a sheep,\" said Hermione coolly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor Trelawney said you didn't have the right aura! You just don't like being bad at something for a change!\"\n\u3000\u3000He had touched a nerve. Hermione slammed her Arithmancy book down on the table so hard that bits of meat and carrot flew everywhere.\n\u3000\u3000\"If being good at Divination means I have to pretend to see death omens in a lump of tea leaves, I'm not sure I'll be studying it much longer! That lesson was absolute rubbish compared with my Arithmancy class!\"\n\u3000\u3000She snatched up her bag and stalked away.\n\u3000\u3000Ron frowned after her.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's she talking about?\" he said to Harry. \"She hasn't been to an Arithmancy class yet.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry was pleased to get out of the castle after lunch. Yesterday's rain had cleared; the sky was a clear, pale gray, and the grass was springy and damp underfoot as they set off for their first ever Care of Magical Creatures class.\n\u3000\u3000Ron and Hermione weren't speaking to each other. Harry walked beside them in silence as they went down the sloping lawns to Hagrid's hut on the edge of the Forbidden Forest. It was only when he spotted three only-too- familiar backs ahead of them that he realized they must be having these lessons with the Slytherins. Malfoy was talking animatedly to Crabbe and Goyle, who were chortling. Harry was quite sure he knew what they were talking about.\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid was waiting for his class at the door of his hut. He stood in his moleskin overcoat, with Fang the boarhound at his heels, looking impatient to start.\n\u3000\u3000\"C'mon, now, get a move on!\" he called as the class approached. \"Got a real treat for yeh today! Great lesson comin' up! Everyone here? Right, follow me!\"\n\u3000\u3000For one nasty moment, Harry thought that Hagrid was going to lead them into the forest; Harry had had enough unpleasant experiences in there to last him a lifetime. However, Hagrid strolled off around the edge of the trees, and five minutes later, they found themselves outside a kind of paddock. There was nothing in there.\n\u3000\u3000\"Everyone gather 'round the fence here!\" he called. \"That's it -- make sure yeh can see -- now, firs' thing yeh'll want ter do is open yer books --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"How?\" said the cold, drawling voice of Draco Malfoy.\n\u3000\u3000\"Eh?\" said Hagrid.\n\u3000\u3000\"How do we open our books?\" Malfoy repeated. He took out his copy of The Monster Book of Monsters, which he had bound shut with a length of rope. Other people took theirs out too; some, like Harry, had belted their book shut; others had crammed them inside tight bags or clamped them together with binder clips.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hasn' -- hasn' anyone bin able ter open their books?\" said Hagrid, looking crestfallen.\n\u3000\u3000The class all shook their heads.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeh've got ter stroke 'em,\" said Hagrid, as though this was the most obvious thing in the world. \"Look --\"\n\u3000\u3000He took Hermione's copy and ripped off the Spellotape that bound it. The book tried to bite, but Hagrid ran a giant forefinger down its spine, and the book shivered, and then fell open and lay quiet in his hand.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, how silly we've all been!\" Malfoy sneered. \"We should have stroked them! why didn't we guess!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I -- I thought they were funny,\" Hagrid said uncertainly to Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, tremendously funny!\" said Malfoy. \"Really witty, giving us books that try and rip our hands off!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Shut up, Malfoy,\" said Harry quietly. Hagrid was looking downcast and Harry wanted Hagrid's first lesson to be a success.\n\u3000\u3000\"Righ' then,\" said Hagrid, who seemed to have lost his thread, \"so -- so yeh've got yer books an' -- an' - - now yeh need the Magical Creatures. Yeah. So I'll go an' get 'em. Hang on... \"\n\u3000\u3000He strode away from them into the forest and out of sight.\n\u3000\u3000\"God, this place is going to the dogs,\" said Malfoy loudly. \"That oaf teaching classes, my father'll have a fit when I tell him\n\u3000\u3000\"Shut up, Malfoy,\" Harry repeated.\n\u3000\u3000\"Careful, Potter, there's a dementor behind you\n\u3000\u3000\"Oooooooh!\" squealed Lavender Brown, pointing toward the opposite side of the paddock.\n\u3000\u3000Trotting toward them were a dozen of the most bizarre creatures Harry had ever seen. They had the bodies, hind legs, and tails of horses, but the front legs, wings, and heads of what seemed to be giant eagles, with cruel, steel-colored beaks and large, brilliantly, orange eyes. The talons on their front legs were half a foot long and deadly looking. Each of the beasts had a thick leather collar around its neck, which was attached to a long chain, and the ends of all of these were held in the vast hands of Hagrid, who came jogging into the paddock behind the creatures.\n\u3000\u3000\"Gee up, there!\" he roared, shaking the chains and urging the creatures toward the fence where the class stood. Everyone drew back slightly as Hagrid reached them and tethered the creatures to the fence.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hippogriffs!\" Hagrid roared happily, waving a hand at them. \"Beau'iful, aren' they?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry could sort of see what Hagrid meant. Once you got over the first shock of seeing something that was, half horse, half bird, you started to appreciate the hippogriffs' gleaming coats, changing smoothly from feather to hair, each of them a different color: stormy gray, bronze, pinkish roan, gleaming chestnut, and inky black.\n\u3000\u3000\"So,\" said Hagrid, rubbing his hands together and beaming around, \"if yeh wan' ter come a bit nearer --\"\n\u3000\u3000No one seemed to want to. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, approached the fence cautiously.\n\u3000\u3000\"Now, firs' thing yeh gotta know abou' hippogriffs is, they're proud,\" said Hagrid. \"Easily offended, hippogriffs are. Don't never insult one, 'cause it might be the last thing yeh do.\"\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle weren't listening; they were talking in an undertone and Harry had a nasty feeling they were plotting how best to disrupt the lesson.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeh always wait fer the hippogriff ter make the firs' move,\" Hagrid continued. \"It's polite, see? Yeh walk toward him, and yeh bow, an' yeh wait. If he bows back, yeh're allowed ter touch him. If he doesn' bow, then get away from him sharpish, 'cause those talons hurt.\n\u3000\u3000\"Right -- who wants ter go first?\"\n\u3000\u3000Most of the class backed farther away in answer. Even Harry, Ron, and Hermione had misgivings. The hippogriffs were tossing their fierce heads and flexing their powerful wings; they didn't seem to like being tethered like this.\n\u3000\u3000\"No one?\" said Hagrid, with a pleading look.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll do it,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000There was an intake of breath from behind him, and both Lavender and Parvati whispered, \"Oooh, no, Harry, remember your tea leaves!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry ignored them. He climbed over the paddock fence.\n\u3000\u3000\"Good man, Harry!\" roared Hagrid. \"Right then -- let's see how yeh get on with Buckbeak.\"\n\u3000\u3000He untied one of the chains, pulled the gray hippogriff away from its fellows, and slipped off its leather collar. The class on the other side of the paddock seemed to be holding its breath. Malfoy's eyes were narrowed maliciously.\n\u3000\u3000\"Easy) now, Harry,\" said Hagrid quietly. \"Yeh've got eye contact, now try not ter blink.... Hippogriffs don' trust yeh if yeh blink too much....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry's eyes immediately began to water, but he didn't shut thern. Buckbeak had turned his great, sharp head and was staring at Harry with one fierce orange eye. \"Tha's it,\" said Hagrid. \"Tha's it, Harry... now, bow.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't feel much like exposing the back of his neck to Buckbeak, but he did as he was told. He gave a short bow and then looked up.\n\u3000\u3000The hippogriff was still staring haughtily at him. It didn't move.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah,\" said Hagrid, sounding worried. \"Right -- back away, now, Harry, easy does it\n\u3000\u3000But then, to Harry's enormous surprise, the hippogriff suddenly bent its scaly front knees and sank into what was an unmistakable bow.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well done, Harry!\" said Hagrid, ecstatic. \"Right -- yeh can touch him! Pat his beak, go on!\"\n\u3000\u3000Feeling that a better reward would have been to back away, Harry moved slowly toward the hippogriff and reached out toward it. He patted the beak several times and the hippogriff closed its eyes lazily, as though enjoying it.\n\u3000\u3000The class broke into applause, all except for Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were looking deeply disappointed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Righ' then, Harry,\" said Hagrid. \"I reckon he might' let yeh ride him!\"\n\u3000\u3000This was more than Harry had bargained for. He was used to a broomstick; but he wasn't sure a hippogriff would be quite the same.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeh climb up there, jus' behind the wing joint,\" said Hagrid, \"an' mind yeh don' pull any of his feathers out, he won' like that....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry put his foot on the top of Buckbeaks wing and hoisted himself onto its back. Buckbeak stood up. Harry wasn't sure where to hold on; everything in front of him was covered with feathers.\n\u3000\u3000\"Go on, then'\" roared Hagrid, slapping the hippogriffs hindquarters.\n\u3000\u3000Without warning, twelve-foot wings flapped open on either side of Harry, he just had time to seize the hippogriff around the neck before he was soaring upward. It was nothing like a broomstick, and Harry knew which one he preferred; the hippogriff's wings beat uncomfortably on either side of him, catching him under his legs and making him feel he was about to be thrown off; the glossy feathers slipped under his fingers and he didn't dare get a stronger grip; instead of the smooth action of his Nimbus Two Thousand, he now felt himself rocking backward and forward as the hindquarters of the hippogriff rose and fell with its wings.\n\u3000\u3000Buckbeak flew him once around the paddock and then headed back to the ground; this was the bit Harry had been dreading; he leaned back as the smooth neck lowered, feeling he was going to slip off over the beak, then felt a heavy thud as the four ill-assorted feet hit the ground. He just managed to hold on and push himself straight again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Good work, Harry!\" roared Hagrid as everyone except Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle cheered. \"Okay, who else wants a go?\"\n\u3000\u3000Emboldened by Harry's success, the rest of the class climbed cautiously into the paddock. Hagrid untied the hippogriffs one by one, and soon people were bowing nervously, all over the paddock. Neville ran repeatedly backward from his, which didn't seem to want to bend its knees. Ron and Hermione practiced on the chestnut, while Harry watched.\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had taken over Buckbeak. He had bowed to Malfoy, who was now patting his beak, looking disdainful.\n\u3000\u3000\"This is very easy,\" Malfoy drawled, loud enough for Harry to, hear him. \"I knew it must have been, if Potter could do it.... I bet you're not dangerous at all, are you?\" he said to the hippogriff. \"Are you, you great ugly brute?\"\n\u3000\u3000It happened in a flash of steely talons; Malfoy let out a highpitched scream and next moment, Hagrid was wrestling Buckbeak back into his collar as he strained to get at Malfoy, who lay curled in the grass, blood blossoming over his robes.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm dying!\" Malfoy yelled as the class panicked. \"I'm dying, look at me! It's killed me!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yer not dyin'!\" said Hagrid, who had gone very white. \"Someone help me -- gotta get him outta here --\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione ran to hold open the gate as Hagrid lifted Malfoy easily. As they passed, Harry saw that there was a long, deep gash on Malfoy's arm; blood splattered the grass and Hagrid ran with him, up the slope toward the castle.\n\u3000\u3000Very shaken, the Care of Magical Creatures class followed at a walk. The Slytherins were all shouting about Hagrid.\n\u3000\u3000\"They should fire him straight away!\" said Pansy Parkinson, who was in tears.\n\u3000\u3000\"It was Malfoy's fault!\" snapped Dean Thomas. Crabbe and Goyle flexed their muscles threateningly.\n\u3000\u3000They all climbed the stone steps into the deserted entrance hall.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm going to see if he's okay!\" said Pansy, and they all watched her run up the marble staircase. The Slytherins, still muttering about Hagrid, headed away in the direction of their dungeon common room; Harry, Ron, and Hermione proceeded upstairs to Gryffindor Tower.\n\u3000\u3000\"You think he'll be all right?\" said Hermione nervously.\n\u3000\u3000\"Course he will. Madam Pomfrey can mend cuts in about a second,\" said Harry, who had had far worse injuries mended magically by the nurse.\n\u3000\u3000\"That was a really bad thing to happen in Hagrid's first class, though, wasn't it?\" said Ron, looking worried. \"Trust Malfoy to mess things up for him....\"\n\u3000\u3000They were among the first to reach the Great Hall at dinnertime, hoping to see Hagrid, but he wasn't there.\n\u3000\u3000\"They wouldn't fire him, would they?\" said Hermione anxiously, not touching her steak-and- kidney pudding.\n\u3000\u3000\"They'd better not,\" said Ron, who wasn't eating either.\n\u3000\u3000Harry was watching the Slytherin table. A large group including Crabbe and Goyle was huddled together, deep in conversation. Harry was sure they were cooking up their own version of how Malfoy had been injured.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, you can't say it wasn't an interesting first day back,\" said Ron gloomily.\n\u3000\u3000They went up to the crowded Gryffindor common room after dinner and tried to do the homework Professor McGonagall had given them, but all three of them kept breaking off and glancing Out of the tower window.\n\u3000\u3000\"There's a light on in Hagrid's window,\" Harry said suddenly.\n\u3000\u3000Ron looked at his watch.\n\u3000\u3000\"If we hurried, we could go down and see him. It's still quite early...\"\n\u3000\u3000I don't know,\" Hermione said slowly, and Harry saw her glance at him.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm allowed to walk across the grounds, \" he said Pointedly. \"Sirius Black hasn't got past the dementors yet, has he?\"\n\u3000\u3000So they put their things away and headed out of the portrait hole, glad to meet nobody on their way to the front doors, as they weren't entirely sure they were supposed to be out.\n\u3000\u3000The grass was still wet and looked almost black in the twilight. When they reached Hagrid's hut, they knocked, and a voice growled, \"C'min.\"\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid was sitting in his shirtsleeves at his scrubbed wooden table; his boarhound, Fang, had his head in Hagrid's lap. One look told them that Hagrid had been drinking a lot; there was a pewter tankard almost as big as a bucket in front of him, and he seemed to be having difficulty getting them into focus.\n\u3000\u3000\"'Spect it's a record,\" he said thickly, when he recognized them. \"Don' reckon they've ever had a teacher who lasted on'y a day before.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You haven't been fired, Hagrid!\" gasped Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"Not yet,\" said Hagrid miserably, taking a huge gulp of whatever was in the tankard. \"But's only a matter o' time, i' n't it, after Malfoy...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"How is he?\" said Ron as they all sat down. \"It wasn't serious, was it?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Madam Pomfrey fixed him best she could,\" said Hagrid dully, \"but he's sayin' it's still agony... covered in bandages... moanin'..\n\u3000\u3000\"He's faking it, \" said Harry at once. \"Madam Pomfrey can mend anything. She regrew half my bones last year. Trust Malfoy to milk it for all it's worth.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"School gov'nors have bin told, o' course,\" said Hagrid miseribly. \"They reckon I started too big. Shoulda left hippogriffs fer later... done flobberworms or summat.... Jus' thought itdmake a good firs' lessons all my fault....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It's all Malfoy's fault, Hagrid!\" said Hermione earnestly.\n\u3000\u3000\"We're witnesses,\" said Harry. \"You said hippogriffs attack if you insult them. It's Malfoy's problem that he wasn't listening. We'll tell Dumbledore what really happened.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, don't worry, Hagrid, we'll back you up,\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000Tears leaked out of the crinkled corners of Hagrid's beetle-black eyes. He grabbed both Harry and Ron and pulled them into a bone-breaking hug.\n\u3000\u3000\"I think you've had enough to drink, Hagrid,\" said Hermione firmly. She took the tankard from the table and went outside to empty it.\n\u3000\u3000\"At, maybe she's right,\" said Hagrid, letting go of Harry and Ron, who both staggered away, rubbing their ribs. Hagrid heaved himself out of his chair and followed Hermione unsteadily outside. They heard a loud splash.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's he done?\" said Harry nervously as Hermione came back in with the empty tankard.\n\u3000\u3000\"Stuck his head in the water barrel,\" said Hermione, putting the tankard away.\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid came back, his long hair and beard sopping wet, wiping the water out of his eyes.\n\u3000\u3000\"That's better,\" he said, shaking his head like a dog and drenching them all. \"Listen, it was good of yeh ter come an' see me, I really --\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid stopped dead, staring at Harry as though he'd only just realized he was there.\n\u3000\u3000\"WHAT D'YEH THINK YOU'RE DOIN', EH?\" he roared, so suddenly that they jumped a foot in the air. \"YEH'RE NOT TO GO WANDERIN' AROUND AFTER DARK, HARRY! AN, YOU TWO! LETTIN' HIM!\"\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid strode over to Harry, grabbed his arm, and pulled him to the door.\n\u3000\u3000\"C'mon!\" Hagrid said angrily. \"I'm takin' yer all back up ter school, an' don' let me catch yeh walkin' down ter see me after dark again. I'm not worth that!\"\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER SEVEN\n\u3000\u3000THE BOGGART IN THE WARDROBE\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy didn't reappear in classes until late on Thursday morning, when the Slytherins and Gryffindors were halfway through double Potions. He swaggered into the dungeon, his right arm covered in bandages and bound up in a sling, acting, in Harry's opinion, as though he were the heroic survivor of some dreadful battle.\n\u3000\u3000\"How is it, Draco?\" simpered Pansy Parkinson. \"Does it hurt much?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah,\" said Malfoy, putting on a brave sort of grimace. But Harry saw him wink at Crabbe and Goyle when Pansy had looked away.\n\u3000\u3000\"Settle down, settle down,\" said Professor Snape idly.\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron scowled at each other; Snape wouldn't have said \"settle down\" if they'd walked in late, he'd have given them detention. But Malfoy had always been able to get away with anything in Snape's classes; Snape was head of Slytherin House, and generality favored his own students above all others.\n\u3000\u3000They were making a new potion today, a Shrinking Solution. Malfoy set up his cauldron right next to Harry and Ron, so that they were preparing their ingredients on the same table.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sir,\" Malfoy called, \"sir, I'll need help cutting up these daisy roots, because of my arm --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Weasley, cut up Malfoy's roots for him,\" said Snape without looking up.\n\u3000\u3000Ron went brick red.\n\u3000\u3000\"There's nothing wrong with your arm,\" he hissed at Malfoy.\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy smirked across the table.\n\u3000\u3000\"Weasley, you heard Professor Snape; cut up these roots.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron seized his knife, pulled Malfoy's roots toward him, and began to chop them roughly, so that they were all different sizes.\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor,\" drawled Malfoy, \"Weasley's mutilating my roots, sit.\"\n\u3000\u3000Snape approached their table, stared down his hooked nose at the roots, then gave Ron an unpleasant smile from beneath his long, greasy black hair.\n\u3000\u3000\"Change roots with Malfoy, Weasley.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But, sit --!\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron had spent the last quarter of an hour carefully shredding his own roots into exactly equal pieces.\n\u3000\u3000\"Now,\" said Snape in his most dangerous voice.\n\u3000\u3000Ron shoved his own beautifully cut roots across the table a, Malfoy, then took up the knife again.\n\u3000\u3000\"And, sir, I'll need this shrivelfig skinned,\" said Malfoy, his voice full of malicious laughter.\n\u3000\u3000\"Potter, you can skin Malfoy's shrivelfig,\" said Snape, giving Harry the look of loathing he always reserved just for him.\n\u3000\u3000Harry took Malfoy's shrivelfig as Ron began trying to repair the damage to the roots he now had to use. Harry skinned the shrivelfig as fast as he could and flung it back across the table at Malfoy without speaking. Malfoy was smirking more broadly than ever.\n\u3000\u3000\"Seen your pal Hagrid lately?\" he asked them quietly.\n\u3000\u3000\"None of your business,\" said Ron jerkily, without looking up.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm afraid he won't be a teacher much longer,\" said Malfoy in a tone of mock sorrow. \"Father's not very happy about my injury --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Keep talking, Malfoy, and I'll give you a real injury,\" snarled Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"- he's complained to the school governors. And to the Ministry of Magic. Father's got a lot of influence, you know. And a lasting injury like this\" -- he gave a huge, fake sigh -- \"who knows if my arm'll ever be the same again?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"So that's why you're putting it on,\" said Harry, accidentally beheading a dead caterpillar because his hand was shaking in anger. \"To try to get Hagrid fired.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well,\" said Malfoy, lowering his voice to a whisper, \"partly, Potter. But there are other benefits too. Weasley, slice my caterpillars for me.\"\n\u3000\u3000A few cauldrons away, Neville was in trouble. Neville regularly went to pieces in Potions lessons; it was his worst subject, and his great fear of Professor Snape made things ten times worse. His potion, which was supposed to be a bright, acid green, had turned --\n\u3000\u3000\"Orange, Longbottom,\" said Snape, ladling some up and allowing to splash back into the cauldron, so that everyone could see.\n\u3000\u3000\"Orange. Tell me, boy, does anything penetrate that thick skull of yours? Didn't you hear me say, quite clearly, that only one -tat spleen was needed? Didn't I state plainly that a dash of leech juice would suffice? What do I have to do to make you understand, Longbottom?\"\n\u3000\u3000Neville was pink and trembling. He looked as though he was on the verge of tears.\n\u3000\u3000\"Please, sir,\" said Hermione, \"please, I could help Neville put it right --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't remember asking you to show off, Miss Granger,\" said Snape coldly, and Hermione went as pink as Neville. \"Longbottom, at the end of this lesson we will feed a few drops of this potion to your toad and see what happens. Perhaps that will encourage you to do it properly.\"\n\u3000\u3000Snape moved away, leaving Neville breathless with fear.\n\u3000\u3000\"Help me!\" he moaned to Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hey, Harry,\" said Seamus Finnigan, leaning over to borrow Harry's brass scales, \"have you heard? Daily Prophet this morning -- they reckon Sirius Black's been sighted.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Where?\" said Harry and Ron quickly. On the other side of the table, Malfoy looked up, listening closely.\n\u3000\u3000\"Not too far from here,\" said Seamus, who looked excited. \"It was a Muggle who saw him. 'Course, she didn't really understand. The Muggles think he's just an ordinary criminal, don't they? So she phoned the telephone hot line. By the time the Ministry of Magic got there, he was gone.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Not too far from here... \" Ron repeated, looking significantly at Harry. He turned around and saw Malfoy watching closely. \"What, Malfoy? Need something else skinned?\"\n\u3000\u3000But Malfoy's eyes were shining malevolently, and they were fixed Harry. He leaned across the table.\n\u3000\u3000Black single-handed, Potter?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Thinking Of trying to catch\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, that's right,\" said Harry offhandedly.\n\u3000\u3000Malfoys thin mouth was curving in a mean smile.\n\u3000\u3000\"Of course, if it was me,\" he said quietly, \"I'd have done something before now. I wouldn't be staying in school like a good boy, I'd be out there looking for him.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What are you talking about, Malfoy?\" said Ron roughly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't you know, Potter?\" breathed Malfoy, his pate eyes narrowed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Know what?\"\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy let out a low, sneering laugh.\n\u3000\u3000\"Maybe you'd rather not risk your neck,\" he said. \"Want to leave it to the dementors, do you? But if it was me, I'd want revenge. I'd hunt him down myself.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What are you talking about?\" said Harry angrily, but at that moment Snape called, \"You should have finished adding your ingredients by now; this potion needs to stew before it can be drunk, so clear away while it simmers and then we'll test Longbottom's... \"\n\u3000\u3000Crabbe and Goyle laughed openly, watching Neville sweat as he stirred his potion feverishly. Hermione was muttering instructions to him out of the corner of her mouth, so that Snape wouldn't see. Harry and Ron packed away their unused ingredients and went to wash their hands and ladles in the stone basin in the corner.\n\u3000\u3000\"What did Malfoy mean?\" Harry muttered to Ron as he stuck his hands under the icy jet that poured from the gargoyle's mouth \"Why would I want revenge on Black? He hasn't done anything to me -- yet.\n\u3000\u3000\"He's making it up,\" said Ron savagely. \"He's trying to make you do something stupid....\"\n\u3000\u3000The end of the lesson in sight, Snape strode over to Neville, who was cowering by his cauldron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Everyone gather 'round,\" said Snape, his black eyes glittering, and watch what happens to Longbottom's toad. If he has managed to produce a Shrinking Solution, it will shrink to a tadpole. If, as I don't doubt, he has done it wrong, his toad is likely to be poisoned.\"\n\u3000\u3000The Gryffindors watched fearfully. The Slytherins looked excited. Snape picked up Trevor the toad in his left hand and dipped a small spoon into Neville's potion, which was now green. He trickled a few drops down Trevor's throat.\n\u3000\u3000There was a moment of hushed silence, in which Trevor gulped; then there was a small pop, and Trevor the tadpole was wriggling in Snape's palm.\n\u3000\u3000The Gryffindors burst into applause. Snape, looking sour, pulled a small bottle from the pocket of his robe, poured a few drops on top of Trevor, and he reappeared suddenly, fully grown.\n\u3000\u3000\"Five points from Gryffindor,\" said Snape, which wiped the smiles from every face. \"I told you not to help him, Miss Granger. Class dismissed.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry, Ron, and Hermione climbed the steps to the entrance hall. Harry was still thinking about what Malfoy had said, while Ron was seething about Snape.\n\u3000\u3000\"Five points from Gryffindor because the potion was all right!\n\u3000\u3000Why didn't You lie, Hermione? You should've said Neville did it all by himself!\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione didn't answer. Ron looked around.\n\u3000\u3000\"Where is she?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry turned too. They were at the top of the steps now, watching the rest of the class pass them, heading for the Great Hall and lunch.\n\u3000\u3000\"She was right behind us,\" said Ron, frowning.\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy passed them, walking between Crabbe and Goyle. He smirked at Harry and disappeared.\n\u3000\u3000\"There she is,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000Hermione was panting slightly, hurrying up the stairs; one hand clutched her bag, the other seemed to be tucking something down the front of her robes.\n\u3000\u3000\"How did you do that?\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" said Hermione, joining them.\n\u3000\u3000\"One minute you were right behind us, the next moment, you were back at the bottom of the stairs again.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" Hermione looked slightly confused. \"Oh -- I had to go back for something. Oh no --\"\n\u3000\u3000A seam had split on Hermione's bag. Harry wasn't surprised; he could see that it was crammed with at least a dozen large and heavy books.\n\u3000\u3000\"Why are you carrying all these around with you?\" Ron asked her.\n\u3000\u3000\"You know how many subjects I'm taking,\" said Hermione breathlessly. \"Couldn't hold these for me, could you?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But --\" Ron was turning over the books she had handed him, looking at the covers. \"You havent got any of these subjects today. It's only Defense Against the Dark Arts this afternoon.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh yes,\" said Hermione vaguely, but she packed all the books back into her bag just the same. I hope there's something good for lunch, I'm starving,\" she added, and she marched off toward the Great Hall.\n\u3000\u3000\"D'you get the feeling Hermione's not telling us something?Ron asked Harry.\n\u3000\u3000Professor Lupin wasn't there when they arrived at his first Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson. They all sat down, took out their books, quills, and parchment, and were talking when he finally entered the room. Lupin smiled vaguely and placed his tatty old briefcase on the teacher's desk. He was as shabby as ever but looked healthier than he had on the train, as though he had had a few square meals.\n\u3000\u3000\"Good afternoon,\" he said. \"Would you please put all your books back in your bags. Today's will be a practical lesson. You will need only your wands.\"\n\u3000\u3000A few curious looks were exchanged as the class put away their books. They had never had a practical Defense Against the Dark Arts before, unless you counted the memorable class last year when their old teacher had brought a cageful of pixies -to class and set them loose.\n\u3000\u3000\"Right then,\" said Professor Lupin, when everyone was ready. \"If you'd follow me.\"\n\u3000\u3000Puzzled but interested, the class got to its feet and followed Professor Lupin out of the classroom. He led them along the deserted corridor and around a corner, where the first thing they saw was Peeves the Poltergeist, who was floating upside down in midair and stuffing the nearest keyhole with chewing gum.\n\u3000\u3000Peeves didn't look up until Professor Lupin was two feet away; ,hen he wiggled his curly-toed feet and broke into song.\n\u3000\u3000\"Loony, loopy Lupin,\" Peeves sang. \"Loony, loopy Lupin, loony, loopy Lupin --\"\n\u3000\u3000Rude and unmanageable as he almost always was, Peeves usually showed some respect toward the teachers. Everyone looked quickly at Professor Lupin to see how he would take this; to their surprise, he was still smiling.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'd take that gum out of the keyhole if I were you, Peeves,\" he said pleasantly. \"Mr. Filch won't be able to get in to his brooms.\"\n\u3000\u3000Filch was the Hogwarts caretaker, a bad-tempered, failed wizard who waged a constant war against the students and, indeed, Peeves. However, Peeves paid no attention to Professor Lupin's words, except to blow a loud wet raspberry.\n\u3000\u3000Professor Lupin gave a small sigh and took out his wand.\n\u3000\u3000\"This is a useful little spell, he told the class over his shoulder. \"Please watch closely.\"\n\u3000\u3000He raised the wand to shoulder height, said, \"Waddiwasi! \"and pointed it at Peeves.\n\u3000\u3000With the force of a bullet, the wad of chewing gum shot out of the keyhole and straight down Peeves's left nostril; he whirled upright and zoomed away, cursing.\n\u3000\u3000\"Cool, sit!\" said Dean Thomas in amazement.\n\u3000\u3000\"Thank you, Dean,\" said Professor Lupin, putting his wand away again. \"Shall we proceed?\"\n\u3000\u3000They set off again, the class looking at shabby Professor Lupin with increased respect. He led them down a second corridor and stopped, right outside the staffroom door.\n\u3000\u3000\"Inside, please,\" said Professor Lupin, opening it and standing back.\n\u3000\u3000The staffroom, a long, paneled room full of old, mismatched chairs, was empty except for one teacher. Professor Snape was sitting in a low armchair, and he looked around as the class filed in. His eyes were glittering and there was a nasty sneer playing around his mouth. As Professor Lupin came in and made to close the door behind him, Snape said, \"Leave it open, Lupin. I'd rather not witness this.\"\n\u3000\u3000He got to his feet and strode past the class, his black robes billowing behind him. At the doorway he turned on his heel and said, \"Possibly no one's warned you, Lupin, but this class contains Neville Longbottom. I would advise you not to entrust him with anything difficult. Not unless Miss Granger is hissing instructions in his ear.\"\n\u3000\u3000Neville went scarlet. Harry glared at Snape; it was bad enough that he bullied Neville in his own classes, let alone doing it in front of other teachers.\n\u3000\u3000Professor Lupin had raised his eyebrows.\n\u3000\u3000\"I was hoping that Neville would assist me with the first stage of the operation,\" he said, \"and I am sure he will perform it admirably.\"\n\u3000\u3000Neville's face went, if possible, even redder. Snape's lip curled, but he left, shutting the door with a snap.\n\u3000\u3000\"Now, then,\" said Professor Lupin, beckoning the class toward the end of the room, where there was nothing but an old wardrobe where the teachers kept their spare robes. As Professor Lupin went to stand next to it, the wardrobe gave a sudden wobble, banging off the wall.\n\u3000\u3000\"Nothing to worry about,\" said Professor Lupin calmly because a few people had jumped backward in alarm. \"There's a boggart in there.\"\n\u3000\u3000Most people seemed to feel that this was something to worry about. Neville gave Professor Lupin a look of pure terror, and Seamus Finnigan eyed the now rattling doorknob apprehensively.\n\u3000\u3000\"Boggarts like dark, enclosed spaces,\" said Professor Lupin. \"Wardrobes, the gap beneath beds, the cupboards under sinks -- I've even met one that had lodged itself in a grandfather clock. This one moved in yesterday afternoon, and I asked the headmaster if the staff would leave it to give my third years some practice.\n\u3000\u3000\"So, the first question we must ask ourselves is, what is a boggart?\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione put up her hand.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's a shape-shifter,\" she said. \"It can take the shape of whatever it thinks will frighten us most.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Couldn't have put it better myself,\" said Professor Lupin, and Hermione glowed. \"So the boggart sitting in the darkness within has not yet assumed a form. He does not yet know what will frighten the person on the other side of the door. Nobody knows what a boggart looks like when he is alone, but when I let him out, he will immediately become whatever each of us most fears.\n\u3000\u3000\"This means,\" said Professor Lupin, choosing to ignore Neville's 'mall sputter of terror, \"that we have a huge advantage over the boggart before we begin. Have you spotted it, Harry?\"\n\u3000\u3000Trying to answer a question with Hermione next to him, bobbing up and down on the balls of her feet with her hand in the air, was very off-putting, but Harry had a go.\n\u3000\u3000\"Er -- because there are so many of us, it won't know what shape it should be?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Precisely,\" said Professor Lupin, and Hermione put her hand down, looking a little disappointed. \"It's always best to have com pany when you're dealing with a boggart. He becomes confused. Which should he become, a headless corpse or a flesh-eating slug? I once saw a boggart make that very mistake -- tried to frighten two people at once and turned himself into half a slug. Not remotely frightening.\n\u3000\u3000\"The charm that repels a boggart is simple, yet it requires force of mind. You see, the thing that really finishes a boggart is laughter. What you need to do is force it to assume a shape that you find amusing.\n\u3000\u3000\"We will practice the charm without wands first. After me, please ... Riddikulus!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Riddikulus!\" said the class together.\n\u3000\u3000\"Good,\" said Professor Lupin. \"Very good. But that was the easy part, I'm afraid. You see, the word alone is not enough. And this is where you come in, Neville.\"\n\u3000\u3000The wardrobe shook again, though not as much as Neville, who walked forward as though he were heading for the gallows.\n\u3000\u3000\"Right, Neville,\" said Professor Lupin. \"First things first: what would you say is the thing that frightens you most in the world?\"\n\u3000\u3000Neville's lips moved, but no noise came out.\n\u3000\u3000\"didn't catch that, Neville, sorry,\" said Professor Lupin cheerfully.\n\u3000\u3000Neville looked around rather wildly, as though begging someone to help him, then said, in barely more than a whisper, \"Professor Snape.\"\n\u3000\u3000Nearly everyone laughed. Even Neville grinned apologetically. Professor Lupin, however, looked thoughtful.\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor Snape... hmmm... Neville, I believe you live with your grandmother?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Er -- yes,\" said Neville nervously. \"But -- I don't want the boggart to turn into her either.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No, no, you misunderstand me,\" said Professor Lupin, now smiling. \"I wonder, could you tell us what sort of clothes your grandmother usually wears?\"\n\u3000\u3000Neville looked startled, but said, \"Well... always the same hat. A tall one with a stuffed vulture on top. And a long dress... green, normally... and sometimes a fox-fur scarf.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"And a handbag?\" prompted Professor Lupin.\n\u3000\u3000\"A big red one,\" said Neville.\n\u3000\u3000\"Right then,\" said Professor Lupin. \"Can you picture those clothes very clearly, Neville? Can you see them in your mind's eye?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" said Neville uncertainty, plainly wondering what was coming next.\n\u3000\u3000\"When the boggart bursts out of this wardrobe, Neville, and sees You, it will assume the form of Professor Snape,\" said Lupin. \"And You will raise your wand -- thus -- and cry 'Riddikulus' -- and concentrate hard on your grandmother's clothes. If all goes well, Professor Boggart Snape will be forced into that vulture-topped hat, and that green dress, with that big red handbag.\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a great shout of laughter. The wardrobe wobbled more violently.\n\u3000\u3000\"If Neville is successful, the boggart is likely to shift his attention to each of us in turn,\" said Professor Lupin. \"I would like all of you to take a moment now to think of the thing that scares you most, and imagine how you might force it to look comical....\"\n\u3000\u3000The room went quiet. Harry thought... 'What scared him most in the world?\n\u3000\u3000His first thought was Lord Voldemort -- a Voldemort returned to full strength. But before he had even started to plan a possible counterattack on a boggart-Voldemort, a horrible image came floating to the surface of his mind....\n\u3000\u3000A rotting, glistening hand, slithering back beneath a black cloak ... a long, rattling breath from an unseen mouth... then a cold so penetrating it felt like drowning....\n\u3000\u3000Harry shivered, then looked around, hoping no one had noticed. Many people had their eyes shut tight. Ron was muttering to himself, \"Take its legs off \" Harry was sure he knew what that was about. Ron's greatest fear was spiders.\n\u3000\u3000\"Everyone ready?\" said Professor Lupin.\n\u3000\u3000Harry felt a lurch of fear. He wasn't ready. How could you make a dementor less frightening? But he didn't want to ask for more time; everyone else was nodding and rolling up their sleeves.\n\u3000\u3000\"Neville, we're going to back away,\" said Professor Lupin. \"Let you have a clear field, all right? I'll call the next person forward.... Everyone back, now, so Neville can get a clear shot --\"\n\u3000\u3000They all retreated, backed against the walls, leaving Neville alone beside the wardrobe. He looked pale and frightened, but he had pushed up the sleeves of his robes and was holding his wand ready.\n\u3000\u3000\"On the count of three, Neville,\" said Professor Lupin, who was\n\u3000\u3000pointing his own wand at the handle of the wardrobe. \"One two -- three -- now!\"\n\u3000\u3000A jet of sparks shot from the end of Professor Lupin's wand and hit the doorknob. The wardrobe burst open. Hook-nosed and menacing, Professor Snape stepped out, his eyes flashing at Neville.\n\u3000\u3000Neville backed away, his wand up, mouthing wordlessly. Snape was bearing down upon him, reaching inside his robes.\n\u3000\u3000\"R -- r -- riddikulus! \"squeaked Neville.\n\u3000\u3000There was a noise like a whip crack. Snape stumbled; he was wearing a long, lace-trimmed dress and a towering hat topped with a moth-eaten vulture, and he was swinging a huge crimson handbag.\n\u3000\u3000There was a roar of laughter; the boggart paused, confused, and Professor Lupin shouted, \"Parvati! Forward!\"\n\u3000\u3000Parvati walked forward, her face set. Snape rounded on her. There was another crack, and where he had stood was a bloodstained, bandaged mummy; its sightless face was turned to Parvati and it began to walk toward her very slowly, dragging its feet, its stiff arms rising --\n\u3000\u3000\"Riddikulus!\" cried Parvati.\n\u3000\u3000A bandage unraveled at the mummy's feet; it became entangled, fell face forward, and its head rolled off.\n\u3000\u3000\"Seamus!\" roared Professor Lupin.\n\u3000\u3000Seamus darted past Parvati.\n\u3000\u3000Crack! Where the mummy had been was a woman with floorlength black hair and a skeletal, green-tinged face -- a banshee. She opened her mouth wide and an unearthly sound filled the room, a long, wailing shriek that made the hair on Harry's head stand on end -- 'Riddikulus!\" shouted Seamus.\n\u3000\u3000The banshee made a rasping noise and clutched her throat; her voice was gone.\n\u3000\u3000Crack! The banshee turned into a rat, which chased its tail in a circle, then -- crack!- became a rattlesnake, which slithered and writhed before -- crack! -- becoming a single, bloody eyeball.\n\u3000\u3000'It's confused!\" shouted Lupin. \"We're getting there! Dean!\"\n\u3000\u3000Dean hurried forward.\n\u3000\u3000Crack! The eyeball became a severed hand, which flipped over and began to creep along the floor like a crab.\n\u3000\u3000\"Riddikulus!\" yelled Dean.\n\u3000\u3000'There was a snap, and the hand was trapped in a mousetrap.\n\u3000\u3000\"Excellent! Ron, you next!\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron leapt forward.\n\u3000\u3000Crack!\n\u3000\u3000Quite a few people screamed. A giant spider, six feet tall and covered in hair, was advancing on Ron, clicking its pincers menacingly. For a moment, Harry thought Ron had frozen. Then --\n\u3000\u3000\"Riddikulus!\" bellowed Ron, and the spider's legs vanished; it rolled over and over; Lavender Brown squealed and ran out of its way and it came to a halt at Harry's feet. He raised his wand, ready, but --\n\u3000\u3000\"Here!\" shouted Professor Lupin suddenly, hurrying forward. Crack!\n\u3000\u3000The legless spider had vanished. For a second, everyone looked wildly around to see where it was. Then they saw a silvery-white orb hanging in the air in front of Lupin, who said, \"Riddikulus!\" almosi lazily.\n\u3000\u3000Crack!\n\u3000\u3000\"Forward, Neville, and finish him off!\" said Lupin as the boggart landed on the floor as a cockroach. Crack! Snape was back. This time Neville charged forward looking determined.\n\u3000\u3000\"Riddikulus!\" he shouted, and they had a split second's view of Snape in his lacy dress before Neville let out a great \"Ha!\" of laughter, and the boggart exploded, burst into a thousand tiny wisps of smoke, and was gone.\n\u3000\u3000\"Excellent!\" cried Professor Lupin as the class broke into applause. \"Excellent) Neville. Well done, everyone.... Let me See... five points to Gryffindor for every person to tackle the boggart -- ten for Neville because he did it twice... and five each to Hermione and Harry.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But I didn't do anything,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"You and Hermione answered my questions correctly at the start of the class, Harry,\" Lupin said lightly. \"Very well, everyone, an excellent lesson. Homework, kindly read the chapter on boggarts and summarize it for me... to be handed in on Monday. That will be all.\"\n\u3000\u3000Talking excitedly, the class left the staffroom. Harry, however, wasn't feeling cheerful. Professor Lupin had deliberately stopped him from tackling the boggart. Why? Was it because he'd seen Harry collapse on the train, and thought he wasn't up to much? Had he thought Harry would pass out again?\n\u3000\u3000But no one else seemed to have noticed anything.\n\u3000\u3000\"Did you see me take that banshee?\" shouted Seamus. \"And the hand!\" said Dean, waving his own around.\n\u3000\u3000\"And Snape in that hat!\" \"And my mummy!\"\n\u3000\u3000I wonder why Professor Lupin's frightened of crystal balls?\" said Lavender thoughtfully.\n\u3000\u3000\"That was the best Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson we've ever had, wasn't it?\" said Ron excitedly as they made their way back to the classroom to get their bags.\n\u3000\u3000\"He seems like a very good teacher,\" said Hermione approvingly. \"But I wish I could have had a turn with the boggart --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What would it have been for you?\" said Ron, sniggering. \"A piece of homework that only got nine out of ten?\"\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER EIGHT\n\u3000\u3000FLIGHT OF THE FAT FADY\n\u3000\u3000In no time at all, Defense Against the Dark Arts had become most people's favorite class. Only Draco Malfoy and his gang of Slytherins had anything bad to say about Professor Lupin.\n\u3000\u3000\"Look at the state of his robes,\" Malfoy would say in a loud whisper as Professor Lupin passed. \"He dresses like our old houseelf \"\n\u3000\u3000But no one else cared that Professor Lupin's robes were patched and frayed. His next few lessons were just as interesting as the first. After boggarts, they studied Red Caps, nasty little goblin like creatures that lurked wherever there had been bloodshed: in the dungeons of castles and the potholes of deserted battlefields, waiting to bludgeon those who had gotten lost. From Red Caps they moved on to kappas, creepy. water-dwellers that looked like scaly monkeys, with webbed hands itching to strangle unwitting waders in their ponds.\n\u3000\u3000Harry only wished he was as happy with some of his other classes. Worst of all was Potions. Snape was in a particularly vindictive mood these days, and no one was in any doubt why. The story of the boggart assuming Snape's shape, and the way that Neville had dressed it in his grandmother's clothes, had traveled through the school like wildfire. Snape didn't seem to find it funny. His eyes flashed menacingly at the very mention of Professor Lupin's name, and he was bullying Neville worse than ever.\n\u3000\u3000Harry was also growing to dread the hours he spent in Professor Trelawney's stifling tower room, deciphering lopsided shapes and symbols, trying to ignore the way Professor Trelawney's enormous eyes filled with tears every time she looked at him. He couldn't like Professer Trelawney, even though she was treated with respect bordering on reverence by many of the class. Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown had taken to haunting Professor Trelawney's tower room at lunch times, and always returned with annoyingly superior looks on their faces, as though they knew things the others didn't. They had also started using hushed voices whenever they spoke to Harry, as though he were on his deathbed.\n\u3000\u3000Nobody really liked Care of Magical Creatures, which, after the action-packed first class, had become extremely dull. Hagrid seemed to have lost his confidence. They were now spending lesson after lesson learning how to look after flobberworms, which had to be some of the most boring creatures in existence.\n\u3000\u3000\"Why would anyone bother looking after them?\" said Ron, after yet another hour of poking shredded lettuce down the flobberworms' throats.\n\u3000\u3000At the start of October, however, Harry had something else to occupy him, something so enjoyable it more than made up for his unsatisfactory classes. The Quidditch season was approaching, and O1iver Wood, Captain of the Gryffindor team, called a meeting on Thursday evening to discuss tactics for the new season.\n\u3000\u3000There were seven people on a Quidditch team: three Chasers, whose job it was to score goals by putting the Quaffle (a red, soccer-sized ball) through one of the fifty-foot-high hoops at each\n\u3000\u3000end of the field; two Beaters, who were equipped with heavy bats to repel the Bludgers (two heavy black balls that zoomed around trying to attack the players); a Keeper, who defended the goal\n\u3000\u3000posts, and the Seeker, who had the hardest job of all, that of catching the Golden Snitch, a tiny, winged, walnut-sized ball, whose capture ended the game and earned the Seeker's team an extra one hundred and fifty points.\n\u3000\u3000Oliver Wood was a burly seventeen-year-old, now in his seventh and final year at Hogwarts. There was a quiet sort of desperation in his voice a's he addressed his six fellow team members in the chilly locker rooms on the edge of the darkening Quidditch field.\n\u3000\u3000\"This is our last chance -- my last chance -- to win the Quidditch Cup,\" he told them, striding up and down in front of them. \"I'll be leaving at the end of this year. I'll never get another shot at it.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Gryffindor hasn't won for seven years now. Okay, so we've had the worst luck in the world -- injuries -- then the tournamentgetting called off last year Wood swallowed, as though the memory still brought a lump to his throat. \"But we also know we've got the best-ruddy-team-in-the-school,\" he said, punching a fist into his other hand, the old manic glint back in his eye. \"We've got three superb Chasers.\"\n\u3000\u3000Wood pointed at Alicia Spinner, Angelina Johnson, and Katie Bell.\n\u3000\u3000\"We've got two unbeatable Beaters.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Stop it, Oliver, you're embarrassing us,\" said Fred and George Weasley together, pretending to blush.\n\u3000\u3000\"And we've got a Seeker who has never failed to win us a match!\" Wood rumbled, glaring at Harry with a kind of furious pride. \"And me,\" he added as an afterthought.\n\u3000\u3000\"We think you're very good too, Oliver,\" said George.\n\u3000\u3000\"Spanking good Keeper,\" said Fred.\n\u3000\u3000\"The point is,\" Wood went on, resuming his pacing, \"the Quidditch Cup should have had our name on it these last two years. Ever since Harry joined the team, I've thought the thing was in the bag. But we haven't got it, and this year's the last chance we'll get to finally see our name on the thing....\"\n\u3000\u3000Wood spoke so dejectedly that even Fred and George looked sympathetic.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oliver, this year's our year,\" said Fred.\n\u3000\u3000\"We'll do it, Oliver!\" said Angelina.\n\u3000\u3000\"Definitely,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000Full of determination, the team started training sessions, three evenings a week. The weather was getting colder and wetter, the nights darker, but no amount of mud, wind, or rain could tarnish Harry's wonderful vision of finally winning the huge, silver Quidditch Cup.\n\u3000\u3000Harry returned to the Gryffindor common room one evening after training, cold and stiff but pleased with the way practice had gone, to find the room buzzing excitedly.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's happened?\", he asked Ron and Hermione, who were sitting in two of the best chairs by the fireside and completing some star charts for Astronomy.\n\u3000\u3000\"First Hogsmeade weekend,\" said Ron, pointing at a notice that had appeared on the battered old bulletin board. \"End of October. Halloween.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Excellent,\" said Fred, who had followed Harry through the portrait hole. \"I need to visit Zonko's. I'm nearly out of Stink Pellets.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry threw himself into a chair beside Ron, his high spirits ebbing away. Hermione seemed to read his mind.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, I'm sure you'll be able to go next time,\" she said. \"They're bound to catch Black soon. He's been sighted once already.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Black's not fool enough to try anything in Hogsmeade,\" said Ron. \"Ask McGonagall if you can go this time, Harry. The next one might not be for ages --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron!\" said Hermione. \"Harry's supposed to stay in school-\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He can't be the only third year left behind,\" said Ron. \"Ask McGonagall, go on, Harry --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, I think I will,\" said Harry, making up his mind.\n\u3000\u3000Hermione opened her mouth to argue, but at that moment Crookshanks leapt lightly onto her lap. A large, dead spider was dangling from his mouth.\n\u3000\u3000\"Does he have to eat that in front of us?\" said Ron, scowling.\n\u3000\u3000\"Clever Crookshanks, did you catch that all by yourself?\" said Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000Crookshanks; slowly chewed up the spider, his yellow eyes fixed insolently on Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Just keep him over there, that's all,\" said Ron irritably, turning back to his star chart. \"1've got Scabbers asleep in my bag.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry yawned. He really wanted to go to bed, but he still had his own star chart to complete. He pulled his bag toward him, took out parchment, ink, and quill, and started work.\n\u3000\u3000\"You can copy mine, if you like,\" said Ron, labeling his last star with a flourish and shoving the chart toward Harry.\n\u3000\u3000Hermione, who disapproved of copying, pursed her lips but didn't say anything. Crookshanks was still staring unblinkingly at Ron, flicking the end of his bushy tail. Then, without warning, he pounced.\n\u3000\u3000\"OY!\" Ron roared, seizing his bag as Crookshanks sank four sets of claws deep inside it and began tearing ferociously. \"GET OFF, YOU STUPID ANIMAL!\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron tried to pull the bag away from Crookshanks, but Crookshanks clung on, spitting and slashing.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron, don't hurt him!\" squealed Hermione; the whole common room was watching; Ron whirled the bag around, Crookshanks still clinging to it, and Scabbers came flying out of the top -\n\u3000\u3000\"CATCH THAT CAR' Ron yelled as Crookshanks freed himself from the remnants of the bag, sprang over the table, and chased after the terrified Scabbers.\n\u3000\u3000George Weasley made a lunge for Crookshanks but missed; Scabbers streaked through twenty pairs of legs and shot beneath an old chest of drawers. Crookshanks skidded to a halt, crouched low on his bandy legs, and started making furious swipes beneath it with his front paw.\n\u3000\u3000Ron and Hermione hurried over; Hermione grabbed Crookshanks around the middle and heaved him away; Ron threw himself onto his stomach and, with great difficulty, pulled Scabbers out by the tail.\n\u3000\u3000\"Look at him!\" he said furiously to Hermione, dangling Scabbers in front of her. \"He's skin and bone! You keep that cat away from him!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Crookshanks doesn't understand it's wrong!\" said Hermione, her voice shaking. \"All cats chase rats, Ron!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"There's something funny about that animal!\" said Ron, who was trying to persuade a frantically wiggling Scabbers back into his pocket. \"It heard me say that Scabbers was in my bag!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, what rubbish,\" said Hermione impatiently. \"Crookshanks could smell him, Ron, how else d'you think --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That cat's got it in for Scabbers!\" said Ron, 'ignoring the people around him, who were starting to giggle. \"And Scabbers was here first, and he's ill!\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron marched through the common room and out of sight up the stairs to the boys' dormitories.\n\u3000\u3000Ron was still in a bad mood with Hermione next day. He barely talked to her all through Herbology, even though he, Harry, and Hermione were working together on the same puffapod.\n\u3000\u3000\"How's Scabbers?\" Hermione asked timidly as they stripped fat pink pods from the plants and emptied the shining beans into a wooden pail.\n\u3000\u3000\"He's hiding at the bottom of my bed, shaking, \" said Ron angrily, missing the pail and scattering beans over the greenhouse floor.\n\u3000\u3000\"Careful, Weasley, careful!\" cried Professor Sprout as the beans burst into bloom before their very eyes.\n\u3000\u3000They had Transfiguration next. Harry, who had resolved to ask Professor McGonagall after the lesson whether he could go into Hogsmeade with the rest, joined the line outside the class trying to decide how he was going to argue his case. He was distracted, however, by a disturbance at the front of the line.\n\u3000\u3000Lavender Brown seemed to be crying. Parvati had her arm around her and was explaining something to Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas, who were looking very serious.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's the matter, Lavender?\" said Hermione anxiously as she, Harry, and Ron went to join the group.\n\u3000\u3000\"She got a letter from home this morning,\" Parvati whispered. \"It's her rabbit, Binky. He's been killed by a fox.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh,\" said Hermione, \"I'm sorry, Lavender.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I should have known!\" said Lavender tragically. \"You know what day it is?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Er --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"The sixteenth of October! 'That thing you're dreading, it will happen on the sixteenth of October!' Remember? She was right, she was right!\"\n\u3000\u3000The whole class was gathered around Lavender now. Seamus shook his head seriously. Hermione hesitated; then she said, \"You -- you were dreading Binky being killed by a fox?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, not necessarily by a fox,\" said Lavender, looking up at Hermione with streaming eyes, \"but I was obviously dreading him dying, wasn't l?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh,\" said Hermione. She paused again. Then\n\u3000\u3000\"Was Binky an old rabbit?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"N -- no!\" sobbed Lavender. \"H -- he was only a baby!\"\n\u3000\u3000Parvati tightened her arm around Lavender's shoulders.\n\u3000\u3000\"But then, why would you dread him dying?\" said Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000Parvati glared at her.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, look at it logically,\" said Hermione, turning to the rest of the group- \"I mean, Binky didn't even die today, did he? Lavender just got the news today-\" Lavender wailed loudly. \"- and she can't have been dreading it, because it's come as a real shock --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't mind Hermione, Lavender,\" said Ron loudly, \"she doesn't think other people's pets matter very much.\"\n\u3000\u3000Professor McGonagall opened the classroom door at that moment, which was perhaps lucky; Hermione and Ron were looking daggers at each other, and when they got into class, they seated themselves on either side of Harry and didn't talk to each other for the whole class.\n\u3000\u3000Harry still hadn't decided what he was going to say to Professor McGonagall when the bell rang at the end of the lesson, but it was she who brought up the subject of Hogsmeade first.\n\u3000\u3000\"One moment, please !\" she called as the class made to leave. \"As you're all in my House, you should hand Hogsmeade permission forms to me before Halloween. No form, no visiting the village, so don't forget!\"\n\u3000\u3000Neville put up his hand.\n\u3000\u3000\"Please, Professor, I -- I think I've lost\n\u3000\u3000\"Your grandmother sent yours to me directly, Longbottom,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"She seemed to think it was safer. Well, that's all, you may leave.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ask her now,\" Ron hissed at Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh. but --\" Hermione began.\n\u3000\u3000\"Go for it, Harry,\" said Ron stubbornly.\n\u3000\u3000Harry waited for the rest of the class to disappear, then headed nervously for Professor McGonagall's desk.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes, Potter?\" Harry took a deep breath.\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor, my aunt and uncle -- er -- forgot to sign my form,\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000Professor McGonagall looked over her square spectacles at him but didn't say anything.\n\u3000\u3000\"So -- er d'you think it would be all right mean, will It be okay if I -- if I go to Hogsmeade?\"\n\u3000\u3000Professor McGonagall looked down and began shuffling papers on her desk.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm afraid not, Potter,\" she said. \"You heard what I said. No form, no visiting the village. That's the rule.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But -- Professor, my aunt and uncle -- you know, they're Muggles, they don't really understand about -- about Hogwarts forms and stuff,\" Harry said, while Ron egged him on with vigorous nods. \"If you said I could go --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But I don't say so,\" said Professor McGonagall, standing up and piling her papers neatly into a drawer. \"The form clearly states that the parent or guardian must give permission.\" She turned to look at him, with an odd expression on her face. Was it pity? \"I'm sorry, Potter, but that's my final word. You had better hurry, or you'll be late for your next lesson.\"\n\u3000\u3000There was nothing to be done. Ron called Professor McGonagall a lot of names that greatly annoyed Hermione; Hermione assumed an \"all-for-the-best\" expression that made Ron even angrier, and Harry had to endure everyone in the class talking loudly and happily about what they were going to do first, once they got into Hogsmeade.\n\u3000\u3000\"There's always the feast,\" said Ron, in an effort to cheer Harry UP. \"You know, the Halloween feast, in the evening.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah,\" said Harry gloomily, \"great.\"\n\u3000\u3000The Halloween feast was always good, but it would taste a lot better if he was coming to it after a day in Hogsmeade with everyone else. Nothing anyone said made him feel any better about being left behind. Dean Thomas, who was good with a quill, had offered to forge Uncle Vernon's signature on the form, but as Harry had already told Professor McGonagall he hadn't had it signed, that was no good. Ron halfheartedly suggested the Invisibility Cloak, but Hermione stamped on that one, reminding Ron what Dumbledore had told them about the dementors being able to see through them. Percy had what were possibly the least helpful words of comfort.\n\u3000\u3000\"They make a fuss about Hogsmeade, but I assure you, Harry, it's not all it's cracked up to be,\" he said seriously. \"All right, the sweetshop's rather good, and Zonko's Joke Shop's frankly dangerous, and yes, the Shrieking Shack's always worth a visit, but really, Harry, apart from that, you're not missing anything.\"\n\u3000\u3000On Halloween morning, Harry awoke with the rest and went down to breakfast, feeling thoroughly depressed, though doing his best to act normally.\n\u3000\u3000\"We'll bring you. lots of sweets back from Honeydukes,\" said Hermione, looking desperately sorry for him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, loads,\" said Ron. He and Hermione had finally forgotten their squabble about Crookshanks in the face of Harry's difficulties.\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't worry about me,\" said Harry, in what he hoped was at, offhand voice, \"I'll see you at the feast. Have a good time.\"\n\u3000\u3000He accompanied them to the entrance hall, where Filch, the caretaker, was standing inside the front doors, checking off names against a long list, peering suspiciously into every face, and making sure that no one was sneaking out who shouldn't be going.\n\u3000\u3000\"Staying here, Potter?\" shouted Malfoy, who was standing in line with Crabbe and Goyle. \"Scared of passing the dementors?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry ignored him and made his solitary way up the marble staircase, through the deserted corridors, and back to Gryffindor Tower.\n\u3000\u3000\"Password?\" said the Fat Lady, jerking out of a doze.\n\u3000\u3000\"Fortuna Major,\" said Harry listlessly.\n\u3000\u3000The portrait swung open and he climbed through the hole into the common room. It was full of chattering first and second years, and a few older students, who had obviously visited Hogsmeade so often the novelty had worn off\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry! Harry! Hi, Harry!\"\n\u3000\u3000It was Colin Creevey, a second year who was deeply in awe of Harry and never missed an opportunity to speak to him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Aren't you going to Hogsmeade, Harry? Why not? Hey\" -- Colin looked eagerly around at his friends -- \"you can come and sit with us, if you like, Harry!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Er -- no, thanks, Colin,\" said Harry, who wasn't in the mood to have a lot of people staring avidly at the scar on his forehead. \"I -- I've got to go to the library, got to get some work done.\"\n\u3000\u3000After that, he had no choice but to turn right around and head back out of the portrait hole again.\n\u3000\u3000\"What was the point waking me up?\" the Fat Lady called grumpily after him as he walked away.\n\u3000\u3000Harry wandered dispiritedly toward the library, but halfway there he changed his mind; he didn't feel like working. He turned around and came face-to-face with Filch, who had obviously just seen off the last of the Hogsmeade visitors.\n\u3000\u3000\"What are you doing?\" Filch snarled suspiciously.\n\u3000\u3000\"Nothing,\" said Harry truthfully.\n\u3000\u3000\"Nothing!\" spat Filch, his jowls quivering unpleasantly. \"A likely story! Sneaking around on your own -- why aren't you in Hogsmeade buying Stink Pellets and Belch Powder and Whizzing Worms like the rest of your nasty little friends?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry shrugged.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, get back to your common room where you belong!\" snapped Filch, and he stood glaring until Harry had passed out of sight.\n\u3000\u3000But Harry didn't go back to the common room; he climbed a staircase, thinking vaguely of visiting the Owlery to see Hedwig, and was walking along another corridor when a voice from inside one of the rooms said, \"Harry?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry doubled back to see who had spoken and met Professor Lupin, looking around his office door.\n\u3000\u3000\"What are you doing?\" said Lupin, though in a very different voice from Filch. \"Where are Ron and Hermione?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hogsmeade,\" said Harry, in a would-be casual voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah,\" said Lupin. He considered Harry for a moment. \"Why don't you come in? I've just taken delivery of a grindylow for our next lesson.\" \"A what?\" said Harry. I\n\u3000\u3000He followed Lupin into his office. In the corner stood a very large tank of water. A sickly green creature with sharp little horns had its face pressed against the glass, pulling faces and flexing its long, spindly fingers.\n\u3000\u3000\"Water demon,\" said Lupin, surveying the grindylow thoughtfully. \"We shouldn't have much difficulty with him, not after the kappas. The trick is to break his grip. You notice the abnormally long fingers? Strong, but very brittle.\"\n\u3000\u3000The grindylow bared its green teeth and then buried itself in a tangle of weeds in a corner.\n\u3000\u3000\"Cup of tea?\" Lupin said, looking around for his kettle. \"I was just thinking of making one.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"All right,\" said Harry awkwardly.\n\u3000\u3000Lupin tapped the kettle with his wand and a blast of steam issued suddenly from the spout.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sit down,\" said Lupin, taking the lid off a dusty tin. \"I've only got teabags, I'm afraid -- but I daresay you've had enough of tea leaves?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked at him. Lupin's eyes were twinkling.\n\u3000\u3000\"How did you know about that?\" Harry asked.\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor McGonagall told me,\" said Lupin, passing Harry a chipped mug of tea. \"You're not worried, are you?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000He thought for a moment of telling Lupin about the dog he'd seen in Magnolia Crescent but decided not to. He didn't want Lupin to think he was a coward, especially since Lupin alreadv seemed to think he couldn't cope with a boggart.\n\u3000\u3000Something of Harry's thoughts seemed to have shown on his face, because Lupin said, \"Anything worrying you, Harry?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" Harry lied. He drank a bit of tea and watched the grindylow brandishing a fist at him. \"Yes,\" he said suddenly, putting his tea down on Lupin's desk. \"You know that day we fought the boggart?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" said Lupin slowly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Why didn't you let me fight it?\" said Harry abruptly.\n\u3000\u3000Lupin raised his eyebrows.\n\u3000\u3000\"I would have thought that was obvious, Harry,\" he said, sounding surprised.\n\u3000\u3000Harry, who had expected Lupin to deny that he'd done any such thing, was taken aback.\n\u3000\u3000\"Why?\" he said again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well,\" said Lupin, frowning slightly, \"I assumed that if the boggart faced you, it would assume the shape of Lord Voldemort.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry stared. Not only was this the last answer he'd expected, but Lupin had said Voldemort's name. The only person Harry had ever heard say the name aloud (apart from himself) was Professor Dumbledore.\n\u3000\u3000\"Clearly, I was wrong,\" said Lupin, still frowning at Harry. \"But I didn't think it a good idea for Lord Voldemort to materialize in the staffroom. I imagined that people would panic.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I didn't think of Voldemort,\" said Harry honestly. \"I -- I remembered those dementors.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I see,\" said Lupin thoughtfully. \"Well, well... I'm impressed.\" fie smiled slightly at the look of surprise on Harry's face. \"That suggests that what you fear most of all is -- fear. Very wise, Harry.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't know what to say to that, so he drank some mot,, tea.\n\u3000\u3000\"So you've been thinking that I didn't believe you capable of fighting the boggart?\" said Lupin shrewdly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well... yeah,\" said Harry. He was suddenly feeling a lot happier. \"Professor Lupin, you know the dementors --\"\n\u3000\u3000He was interrupted by a knock on the door.\n\u3000\u3000\"Come in,\" called Lupin.\n\u3000\u3000The door opened, and in came Snape. He was carrying a goblet, which was smoking faintly, and stopped at the sight of Harry, his black eyes narrowing.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah, Severus,\" said Lupin, smiling. \"Thanks very much. Could you leave it here on the desk for me?\"\n\u3000\u3000Snape set down the smoking goblet, his eyes wandering between Harry and Lupin.\n\u3000\u3000\"I was just showing Harry my grindylow,\" said Lupin pleasantly, pointing at the tank.\n\u3000\u3000\"Fascinating,\" said Snape, without looking at it. \"You should drink that directly, Lupin.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes, Yes, I will,\" said Lupin.\n\u3000\u3000\"I made an entire cauldronful,\" Snape continued. \"If you need more.\n\u3000\u3000\"I should probably take some again tomorrow. Thanks very much, Severus.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Not at all,\" said Snape, but there was a look in his eye Harry didn't like. He backed out of the room, unsmiling and watchful.\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked curiously at the goblet. Lupin smiled.\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor Snape has very kindly concocted a potion for me,\" he said. \"I have never been much of a potion-brewer and this one is particularly complex.\" He picked up the goblet and sniffed it. \"Pity sugar makes it useless,\" he added, taking a sip and shuddering.\n\u3000\u3000\"Why --?\" Harry began. Lupin looked at him and answered the unfinished question.\n\u3000\u3000\"I've been feeling a bit off-color,\" he said. \"This potion is the only thing that helps. I am very lucky to be working alongside Professor Snape; there aren't many wizards who are up to making it.\"\n\u3000\u3000Professor Lupin took another sip and Harry had a crazy urge to knock the goblet out of his hands.\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor Snape's very interested in the Dark Arts, he blurted out.\n\u3000\u3000\"Really?\" said Lupin, looking only mildly interested as he took another gulp of potion.\n\u3000\u3000\"Some people reckon --\" Harry hesitated, then plunged recklessly on, \"some people reckon he'd do anything to get the Defense Against the Dark Arts job.\"\n\u3000\u3000Lupin drained the goblet and pulled a face.\n\u3000\u3000\"Disgusting,\" he said. \"Well, Harry, I'd better get back to work. see you at the feast later.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Right,\" said Harry, putting down his empty teacup.\n\u3000\u3000The empty goblet was still smoking.\n\u3000\u3000\"There you go,\" said Ron. \"We got as much as we could carry.\"\n\u3000\u3000A shower of brilliantly colored sweets fell into Harry's lap. It was dusk, and Ron and Hermione had just turned up in the common room, pink-faced from the cold wind and looking as though they'd had the time of their lives.\n\u3000\u3000\"Thanks,\" said Harry, picking up a packet of tiny black Pepper Imps. \"What's Hogsmeade like? Where did you go?\"\n\u3000\u3000By the sound of it -- everywhere. Dervish and Banges, the wizarding equipment shop, Zonko's Joke Shop, into the Three Broomsticks for foaming mugs of hot butterbeer, and many places besides.\n\u3000\u3000\"The post office, Harry! About two hundred owls, all sitting on shelves, all color-coded depending on how fast you want your letter to get there!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Honeydukes has got a new kind of fudge; they were giving out free samples, there's a bit, look --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We think we saw an ogre, honestly, they get all sorts at the Three Broomsticks --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Wish we could have brought you some butterbeer, really warms you up --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What did you do?\" said Hermione, looking anxious. \"Did you get any work done?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Harry. \"Lupin made me a cup of tea in his office. And then Snape came in....\"\n\u3000\u3000He told them all about the goblet. Ron's mouth fell open.\n\u3000\u3000\"Lupin drank it?\" he gasped. \"Is he mad?\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione checked her watch.\n\u3000\u3000\"We'd better go down, you know, the feast'll be starting in fiveminutes They hurried through the portrait hole and into the crowd, still discussing Snape.\n\u3000\u3000\"But if he -- you know\" -- Hermione dropped her voice, glancing nervously around -- \"if he was trying to to poison Lupin -- he wouldn't have done it in front of Harry.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, maybe,\" said Harry as they reached the entrance hall and crossed into the Great Hall. It had been decorated with hundreds and hundreds of candle-filled pumpkins, a cloud of fluttering live bats, and many flaming orange streamers, which were swimming lazily across the stormy ceiling like brilliant watersnakes.\n\u3000\u3000The food was delicious; even Hermione and Ron, who were full to bursting with Honeydukes sweets, managed second helpings of everything. Harry kept glancing at the staff table. Professor Lupin\n\u3000\u3000looked cheerful and as well as he ever did; he was talking animatedly to tiny little Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher. Harry moved his eyes along the table, to the place where Snape sat. Was he imagining it, or were Snape's eyes flickering toward Lupin more often than was natural?\n\u3000\u3000The feast finished with an entertainment provided by the Hogwarts ghosts. They popped out of the walls and tables to do a bit of formation gliding; Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost, had a great success with a reenactment of his own botched beheading.\n\u3000\u3000It had been such a pleasant evening that Harry's good mood couldn't even be spoiled by Malfoy, who shouted through the crowd as they all left the hall, \"The dementors send their love, Potter!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed the rest of the Gryffindors along the usual path to Gryffindor Tower, but when they reached the corridor that ended with the portrait of the Fat Lady, they found it jammed with students.\n\u3000\u3000\"Why isn't anyone going in?\" said Ron curiously.\n\u3000\u3000Harry peered over the heads in front of him. The portrait seemed to be closed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Let me through, please,\" came Percy's voice, and he came bustling importantly through the crowd. \"What's the holdup here? You can't all have forgotten the password -- excuse me, I'm Head Boy --\"\n\u3000\u3000And then a silence fell over the crowd, from the front first, so that a chill seemed to spread down the corridor. They heard Percy say, in a suddenly sharp voice, \"Somebody get Professor Dumbledore. Quick.\"\n\u3000\u3000People's heads turned; those at the back were standing on tiptoe.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's going on?\" said Ginny, who had just arrived.\n\u3000\u3000A moment later, Professor Dumbledore was there, sweeping toward the portrait; the Gryffindors squeezed together to let him through, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer to see what the trouble was.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, my --\" Hermione grabbed Harry's arm.\n\u3000\u3000The Fat Lady had vanished from her portrait, which had been slashed so viciously that strips of canvas littered the floor; great chunks of it had been torn away completely.\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore took one quick look at the ruined painting and turned, his eyes somber, to see Professors McGonagall, Lupin, and Snape hurrying toward him.\n\u3000\u3000\"We need to find her,\" said Dumbledore. \"Professor McGonagall, please go to Mr. Filch at once and tell him to search every painting in the castle for the Fat Lady.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You'll be lucky!\" said a cackling voice.\n\u3000\u3000It was Peeves the Poltergeist, bobbing over the crowd and looking delighted, as he always did, at the sight of wreckage or worry.\n\u3000\u3000\"What do you mean, Peeves?\" said Dumbledore calmly, and Peeves's grin faded a little. He didn't dare taunt Dumbledore. Instead he adopted an oily voice that was no better than his cackle. \"Ashamed, Your Headship, sit. Doesn't want to be seen. She's a horrible mess. Saw her running through the landscape up on the fourth floor, sir, dodging between the trees. Crying something dreadful,\" he said happily. \"Poor thing,\" he added unconvincingly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Did she say who did it?\" said Dumbledore quietly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh yes, Professorhead,\" said Peeves, with the air of one cradling a large bombshell in his arms. \"He got very angry when she wouldn't let him in, you see.\" Peeves flipped over and grinned at Dumbledore from between his own legs. \"Nasty temper he's got, that Sirius Black.\"\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER NINE\n\u3000\u3000GRIM DEFEAT\n\u3000\u3000Professor Dumbledore sent all the Gryffindors back to the Great Hall, where they were joined ten minutes later by the students from Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin, who all looked extremely confused.\n\u3000\u3000\"The teachers and I need to conduct a thorough search of the castle,\" Professor Dumbledore told them as Professors McGonagall and Flitwick closed all doors into the hall. \"I'm afraid that, for your own safety, you will have to spend the night here. I want the prefects to stand guard over the entrances to the hall and I am leaving the Head Boy and Girl in charge. Any disturbance should be reported to me immediately,\" he added to Percy, who was looking immensely proud and important. \"Send word with one of the ghosts.\"\n\u3000\u3000Professor Dumbledore paused, about to leave the hall, and said, \"Oh, yes, you'll be needing...\"\n\u3000\u3000One casual wave of his wand and the long tables flew to the edges of the hall and stood themselves against the walls; another wave, and the floor was covered with hundreds of squashy purple sleeping bags.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sleep well,\" said Professor Dumbledore, closing the door behind him.\n\u3000\u3000The hall immediately began to buzz excitedly; the Gryffindors were telling the rest of the school what had just happened.\n\u3000\u3000\"Everyone into their sleeping bags!\" shouted Percy. \"Come on, now, no more talking! Lights out in ten minutes!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"C'mon,\" Ron said to Harry and Hermione; they seized three sleeping bags and dragged them into a corner.\n\u3000\u3000\"Do you think Black's still in the castle?\" Hermione whispered anxiously.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dumbledore obviously thinks he might be,\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's very lucky he picked tonight, you know,\" said Hermione as they climbed fully dressed into their sleeping bags and propped themselves on their elbows to talk. \"The one night we weren't in the tower....\"\n\u3000\u3000I reckon he's lost track of time, being on the run,\" said Ron. \"Didn't realize it was Halloween. Otherwise he'd have come bursting in here.\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione shuddered.\n\u3000\u3000All around them, people were asking one another the same question: \"How did he get in?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Maybe he knows how to Apparate,\" said a Ravenclaw a few feet away, \"Just appear out of thin air, you know.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Disguised himself, probably,\" said a Hufflepuff fifth year. \"He could've flown in,\" suggested Dean Thomas.\n\u3000\u3000\"Honestly, am I the only person who's ever bothered to read Hogwarts, A History?\" said Hermione crossly to Harry and Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Probably,\" said Ron. \"Why?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Because the castle's protected by more than walls, You know,,, said Hermione. \"There are all sorts of enchantments on it, to stop people entering by stealth. You can't just Apparate in here. And I'd like to see the disguise that could fool those dementors. They're guarding every single entrance to the grounds. They'd have seen him fly in too. And Fitch knows all the secret passages, they'll have them covered....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"The lights are going out now!\" Percy shouted. \"I want everyone in their sleeping bags and no more talking!\"\n\u3000\u3000The candles all went out at once. The only light now came from the silvery ghosts, who were drifting about talking seriously to the prefects, and the enchanted ceiling, which, like the sky outside, was scattered with stars. What with that, and the whispering that still filled the hall, Harry felt as though he were sleeping outdoors in a light wind.\n\u3000\u3000Once every hour, a teacher would reappear in the hall to check that everything was quiet. Around three in the morning, when many students had finally fallen asleep, Professor Dumbledore came in. Harry watched him looking around for Percy, who had been prowling between the sleeping bags, telling people off for talking. Percy was only a short way away from Harry, Ron, and Hermlone, who quickly pretended to be asleep as Dumbledore's footsteps drew nearer.\n\u3000\u3000\"Any sign of him, Professor?\" asked Percy in a whisper.\n\u3000\u3000\"No. All well here?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Everything under control, sir.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Good. There's no point moving them all now. I've found a temporary guardian for the Gryffindor portrait hole. You'll be able to move them back in tomorrow.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"And the Fat Lady, sir?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hiding in a map of Argyllshire on the second floor. Apparently she refused to let Black in without the password, so he attacked. She's still very distressed, but once she's calmed down, I'll have Mr. Filch restore her.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry heard the door of the hall creak open again, and more footsteps.\n\u3000\u3000\"Headmaster?\" It was Snape. Harry kept quite still, listening hard. \"The whole of the third floor has been searched. He's not there. And Filch has done the dungeons; nothing there either.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What about the Astronomy tower? Professor Trelawney's room? The Owlery?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"All searched.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Very well, Severus. I didn't really expect Black to linger.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Have you any theory as to how he got in, Professor?\" asked Snape.\n\u3000\u3000Harry raised his head very slightly off his arms to free his other ear,\n\u3000\u3000\"Many, Severus, each of them as unlikely as the next.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry opened his eyes a fraction and squinted up to where they stood; Dumbledore's back was to him, but he could see Percy's face, rapt with attention, and Snape's profile, which looked angry.\n\u3000\u3000\"You remember the conversation we had, Headmaster, just before -- ah -- the start of term?\" said Snape, who was barely opening his lips, as though trying to block Percy out of the conversation.\n\u3000\u3000\"I do, Severus,\" said Dumbledore, and there was something like warning in his voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"It seems -- almost impossible -- that Black could have entered the school without inside help. I did express my concerns whet, you appointed --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I do not believe a single person inside this castle would have helped Black enter it,\" said Dumbledore, and his tone made it so clear that the subject was closed that Snape didn't reply. \"I must go down to the dementors,\" said Dumbledore. I said I would inform them when our search was complete.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Didn't they want to help, sit?\" said Percy.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh yes,\" said Dumbledore coldly. \"But I'm afraid no dementor will cross the threshold of this castle while I am headmaster.\"\n\u3000\u3000Percy looked slightly abashed. Dumbledore left the hall, walking quickly and quietly. Snape stood for a moment, watching the headmaster with an expression of deep resentment on his face; then he too left.\n\u3000\u3000Harry glanced sideways at Ron and Hermione. Both of them had their eyes open too, reflecting the starry ceiling.\n\u3000\u3000\"\\What was all that about?\" Ron mouthed.\n\u3000\u3000The school talked of nothing but Sirius Black for the next few days. The theories about how he had entered the castle became wilder and wilder; Hannah Abbott, from Hufflepuff, spent much of their next Herbology class telling anyone who'd listen that Black could turn into a flowering shrub.\n\u3000\u3000The Fat Lady's ripped canvas had been taken off the wall and\n\u3000\u3000Replaced with the portrait of Sir Cadogan and his fat gray pony. Nobody was very happy about this. Sir Cadogan spent half his time challenging people to duels, and the rest thinking up ridiculously complicated passwords, which he changed at least twice a day.\n\u3000\u3000\"He's a complete lunatic,\" said Seamus Finnigan angrily to Percy. \"Can't we get anyone else?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"None of the other pictures wanted the job,\" said Percy. \"Frightened of what happened to the Fat Lady. Sir Cadogan was the only one brave enough to volunteer.\"\n\u3000\u3000Sir Cadogan, however, was the least of Harry's worries. He was now being closely watched. Teachers found excuses to walk along corridors with him, and Percy Weasley (acting, Harry suspected, on his mother's orders) was tailing him everywhere like an extremely pompous guard dog. To cap it all, Professor McGonagall summoned Harry into her office, with such a somber expression on her face Harry thought someone must have died.\n\u3000\u3000\"There's no point hiding it from you any longer, Potter,\" she said in a very serious voice. \"I know this will come as a shock to you, but Sirius Black --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I know he's after me,\" said Harry wearily. \"I heard Ron's dad telling his mum. Mr. Weasley works for the Ministry of Magic.\"\n\u3000\u3000Professor McGonagall seemed very taken aback. She stared at Harry for a moment or two, then said, \"I see! Well, in that case, Potter, you'll understand why I don't think it's a good idea for you to be practicing Quidditch in the evenings. Out on the field with only Your team members, it's very exposed, Potter --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We've got our first match on Saturday!\" said Harry, outraged. \"I've got to train, Professor!\"\n\u3000\u3000Professor McGonagall considered him intently. Harry knew she was deeply interested in the Gryffindor team's prospects; it had been she, after all, who'd suggested him as Seeker in the first Place. He waited, holding his breath.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hmm...\" Professor McGonagall stood up and stared out of the window at the Quidditch field, just visible through the rain. \"Well... goodness knows, I'd like to see us win the Cup at last... but all the same, Potter... I'd be happier if a teacher were present. I'll ask Madam Hooch to oversee your training sessions.\"\n\u3000\u3000The weather worsened steadily as the first Quidditch match drew nearer. Undaunted, the Gryffindor team was training harder than ever under the eye of Madam Hooch. Then, at their final training session before Saturday's match, Oliver Wood gave his team some unwelcome news.\n\u3000\u3000\"We're not playing Slytherin!\" he told them, looking very angry. \"Flint's just been to see me. We're playing Hufflepuff instead.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Why?\" chorused the rest of the team.\n\u3000\u3000\"Flint's excuse is that their Seeker's arm's still injured,\" said Wood, grinding his teeth furiously. \"But it's obvious why they're doing it. Don't want to play in this weather. Think it'll damage their chances....\"\n\u3000\u3000There had been strong winds and heavy rain all day, and as Wood spoke, they heard a distant rumble of thunder.\n\u3000\u3000\"There's nothing wrong with Malfoy's arm!\" said Harry furiously. \"He's faking it!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I know that, but we can't prove it,\" said Wood bitterly, \"And we've been practicing all those moves assuming we're playing Slytherin, and instead it's Hufflepuff, and their style's quite different. They've got a new Captain and Seeker, Cedric Diggory --\"\n\u3000\u3000Angelina, Alicia, and Katie suddenly giggled.\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" said Wood, frowning at this lighthearted behavior.\n\u3000\u3000\"He's that tall, good-looking one, isn't he?\" said Angelina.\n\u3000\u3000\"Strong and silent,\" said Katie, and they started to giggle again.\n\u3000\u3000\"He's only silent because he's too thick to string two words together,\" said Fred impatiently. \"I don't know why you're worried, Oliver, Hufflepuff is a pushover. Last time we played them, Harry caught the Snitch in about five minutes, remember?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We were playing in completely different conditions!\" Wood shouted, his eyes bulging slightly. \"Diggory's put a very strong side together! He's an excellent Seeker! I was afraid you'd take it like this! We mustn't relax! We must keep our focus! Slytherin is trying to wrong-foot us! We must win!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oliver, calm down!\" said Fred, looking slightly alarmed. \"We're taking Hufflepuff very seriously. Seriously.\"\n\u3000\u3000The day before the match, the winds reached howling point and the rain fell harder than ever. It was so dark inside the corridors and classrooms that extra torches and lanterns were lit. The Slytherin team was looking very smug indeed, and none more so than Malfoy.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah, if only my arm was feeling a bit better!\" he sighed as the gale outside pounded the windows.\n\u3000\u3000Harry had no room in his head to worry about anything except the match tomorrow. Oliver Wood kept hurrying up to him between classes and giving him tips. The third time this happened, Wood talked for so long that Harry suddenly realized he was ten minutes late for Defense Against the Dark Arts, and set off at a run with Wood shouting after him, \"Diggory's got a very fast swerve, Harry, so you might want to try looping him --\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry skidded to a halt outside the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom, pulled the door open, and dashed inside.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sorry I'm late, Professor Lupin. I --\"\n\u3000\u3000But it wasn't Professor Lupin who looked up at him from the teacher's desk; it was Snape.\n\u3000\u3000\"This lesson began ten minutes ago, Potter, so I think we'll make it ten points from Gryffindor. Sit down.\"\n\u3000\u3000But Harry didn't move.\n\u3000\u3000\"Where's Professor Lupin?\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000\"He says he is feeling too ill to teach today,\" said Snape with a twisted smile. \"I believe I told you to sit down?\"\n\u3000\u3000But Harry stayed where he was.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's wrong with him?\"\n\u3000\u3000Snape's black eyes glittered.\n\u3000\u3000\"Nothing life-threatening,\" he said, looking as though he wished it were. \"Five more points from Gryffindor, and if I have to ask you to sit down again, it will be fifty.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry walked slowly to his seat and sat down. Snape looked around at the class.\n\u3000\u3000\"As I was saying before Potter interrupted, Professor Lupin has not left any record of the topics you have covered so far --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Please, sir, we've done boggarts, Red Caps, kappas, and grindylows,\" said Hermione quickly, \"and we're just about to start --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Be quiet,\" said Snape coldly. \"I did not ask for information. I was merely commenting on Professor Lupin's lack of organization.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He's the best Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher we've ever had,\" said Dean Thomas boldly, and there was a murmur of agreement from the rest of the class. Snape looked more menacing than ever.\n\u3000\u3000\"You are easily satisfied. Lupin is hardly overtaxing you -- I ,Would expect first years to be able to deal with Red Caps and grindylows. Today we shall discuss --\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry watched him flick through the textbook, to the very back chapter, which he must know they hadn't covered.\n\u3000\u3000\"Werewolves,\" said Snape.\n\u3000\u3000\"But, sir,\" said Hermione, seemingly unable to restrain herself, \"we're not supposed to do werewolves yet, we're due to start hinkypunks --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Miss Granger,\" said Snape in a voice of deadly calm, \"I was under the impression that I am teaching this lesson, not you. And I am telling you all to turn to page 394.\" He glanced around again. 'All of you! Now!\"\n\u3000\u3000With many bitter sidelong looks and some sullen muttering, the class opened their books.\n\u3000\u3000\"Which of you can tell me how we distinguish between the werewolf and the true wolf?\" said Snape.\n\u3000\u3000Everyone sat in motionless silence; everyone except Hermione, whose hand, as it so often did, had shot straight into the air.\n\u3000\u3000\"Anyone?\" Snape said, ignoring Hermione. His twisted smile was back. \"Are you telling me that Professor Lupin hasn't even taught you the basic distinction between --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We told you,\" said Parvati suddenly, \"we haven't got as far as werewolves yet, we're still on --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Silence!\" snarled Snape. \"Well, well, well, I never thought I'd meet a third-year class who wouldn't even recognize a werewolf when they saw one. I shall make a point of informing Professor Dumbledore how very behind you all are....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Please, sir,\" said Hermione, whose hand was still in the air, \"the werewolf differs from the true wolf in several small ways. The snout of the werewolf --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That is the second time you have spoken out of turn, Miss Granger,\" said Snape coolly. \"Five more points from Gryffindor for being an insufferable know-it-all.\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione went very red, put down her hand, and stared at the floor with her eyes full of tears. It was a mark of how much the class loathed Snape that they were all glaring at him, because every one of them had called Hermione a know-it-all at least once, and Ron, who told Hermione she was a know-it-all at least twice a week, said loudly, \"You asked us a question and she knows the answer! Why ask if you don't want to be told?\"\n\u3000\u3000The class knew instantly he'd gone too far. Snape advanced on Ron slowly, and the room held its breath.\n\u3000\u3000\"Detention, Weasley,\" Snape said silkily, his face very close to Ron's. \"And if I ever hear you criticize the way I teach a class again, you will be very sorry indeed.\"\n\u3000\u3000No one made a sound throughout the rest of the lesson. They sat and made notes on werewolves from the textbook, while Snape prowled up and down the rows of desks, examining the work they had been doing with Professor Lupin.\n\u3000\u3000\"Very poorly explained... That is incorrect, the kappa is more commonly found in Mongolia.... Professor Lupin gave this eight out of ten? I wouldn't have given it three....\"\n\u3000\u3000When the bell rang at last, Snape held them back.\n\u3000\u3000\"You will each write an essay, to be handed in to me, on the ways you recognize and kill werewolves. I want two rolls of parchment or, the subject, and I want them by Monday morning. It is time somebody took this class in hand. Weasley, stay behind, we need to arrange your detention.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Hermione left the room with the rest of the class, who waited until they were well out of earshot, then burst into a furious tirade about Snape.\n\u3000\u3000\"Snape's never been like this with any of our other Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers, even if he did want the job,\" Harry said to Hermione. \"Why's he got it in for Lupin? D'you think this is all because of the boggart?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't know,\" said Hermione pensively. \"But I really hope Professor Lupin gets better soon....\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron caught up with them five minutes later, in a towering rage.\n\u3000\u3000\"D'you know what that --\" (he called Snape something that made Hermione say \"Ron!\") \"-- is making me do? I've got to scrub out the bedpans in the hospital wing. Without magic!\" He was breathing deeply, his fists clenched. \"Why couldn't Black have hidden in Snape's office, eh? He could have finished him off for us!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry woke extremely early the next morning; so early that it was till dark. For a moment he thought the roaring of the wind had woken him. Then he felt a cold breeze on the back of his neck and sat bolt upright -- Peeves the Poltergeist had been floating next to him, blowing hard in his ear.\n\u3000\u3000\"What did you do that for?\" said Harry furiously. Peeves puffed out his cheeks, blew hard, and zoomed backward out of the room, cackling.\n\u3000\u3000Harry fumbled for his alarm clock and looked at it. It was half past four. Cursing Peeves, he rolled over and tried to get back to sleep, but it was very difficult, now that he was awake, to ignore the sounds of the thunder rumbling overhead, the pounding of the wind against the castle walls, and the distant creaking of the trees in the Forbidden Forest. In a few hours he would be out on the Quidditch field, battling through that gale. Finally, he gave up any thought of more sleep, got up, dressed, picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand, and walked quietly out of the dormitory.\n\u3000\u3000As Harry opened the door, something brushed against his leg. He bent down just in time to grab Crookshanks by the end of his bushy tail and drag him outside.\n\u3000\u3000\"You know, I reckon Ron was right about you,\" Harry told Crookshanks suspiciously. \"There are plenty of mice around this place -- go and chase them. Go on,\" he added, nudging Crookshanks down the spiral staircase with his foot. \"Leave Scabbers alone.\"\n\u3000\u3000The noise of the storm was even louder in the common roorn. Harry knew better than to think the match would be canceled; Quidditch matches weren't called off for trifles like thunderstorms. Nevertheless, he was starting to feel very apprehensive. Wood had pointed out Cedric Diggory to him in the corridor; Diggory was a fifth year and a lot bigger than Harry. Seekers were usually light\n\u3000\u3000and speedy, but Diggory's weight would be an advantage in this weather because he was less likely to be blown off course.\n\u3000\u3000Harry whiled away the hours until dawn in front of the fire, getting up every now and then to stop Crookshanks from sneaking up\n\u3000\u3000the boys, staircase again. At long last Harry thought it must be time for breakfast, so he headed through the portrait hole alone.\n\u3000\u3000\"Stand and fight, you mangy cur!\" yelled Sir Cadogan.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, shut up,\" Harry yawned.\n\u3000\u3000He revived a bit over a large bowl of porridge, and by the time he'd started on toast, the rest of the team had turned up.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's going to be a tough one,\" said Wood, who wasn't eating anything.\n\u3000\u3000\"Stop worrying, Oliver,\" said Alicia soothingly, \"we don't mind a bit of rain.\"\n\u3000\u3000But it was considerably more than a bit of rain. Such was the popularity of Quidditch that the whole school turned out to watch the match as usual, but they ran down the lawns toward the Quidditch field, heads bowed against the ferocious wind, umbrellas being whipped out of their hands as they went. just before he entered the locker room, Harry saw Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, laughing and pointing at him from under an enormous umbrella on their way to the stadium.\n\u3000\u3000The team changed into their scarlet robes and waited for Wood's usual pre-match pep talk, but it didn't come. He tried to speak several times, made an odd gulping noise, then shook his head hopelessly and beckoned them to follow him.\n\u3000\u3000The wind was so strong that they staggered sideways as they walked out onto the field. If the crowd was cheering, they couldn't hear it over the fresh rolls of thunder. Rain was splattering over Harry's glasses. How on earth was he going to see the Snitch in this?\n\u3000\u3000The Hufflepuffs were approaching from the opposite side of the field, wearing canary-yellow robes. The Captains walked up to eacb other and shook hands; Diggory smiled at Wood but Wood no, looked as though he had lockjaw and merely nodded. Harry saw Madam Hooch's mouth form the words, \"Mount Your brooms.,, He pulled his right foot out of the mud with a squelch and swung it over his Nimbus Two Thousand. Madam Hooch put her whistle to her lips and gave it a blast that sounded shrill and distant they were off\n\u3000\u3000Harry rose fast, but his Nimbus was swerving slightly with the wind. He held it as steady as he could and turned, squinting into the rain.\n\u3000\u3000Within five minutes Harry was soaked to his skin and frozen, hardly able to see his teammates, let alone the tiny Snitch. He flew backward and forward across the field past blurred red and yellow shapes, with no idea of what was happening in the rest of the game. He couldn't hear the commentary over the wind. The crowd was hidden beneath a sea of cloaks and battered umbrellas. Twice Harry came very close to being unseated by a Bludger; his vision was so clouded by the rain on his glasses he hadn't seen them coming.\n\u3000\u3000He lost track of time. It was getting harder and harder to hold his broom straight. The sky was getting darker, as though night had decided to come early. Twice Harry nearly hit another player, without knowing whether it was a teammate or opponent; everyone was now so wet, and the rain so thick, he could hardly tell them apart....\n\u3000\u3000With the first flash of lightning came the sound of Madam Hooch's whistle; Harry could just see the outline of Wood through the thick rain, gesturing him to the ground. The whole team splashed down into the mud.\n\u3000\u3000\"I called for time-out!\" Wood roared at his team. \"Come on, under here --\"\n\u3000\u3000They huddled at the edge of the field under a large umbrella; Harry took off his glasses and wiped them hurriedly on his robes.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's the score?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We're fifty points up,\" said Wood, \"but unless we get the Snitch soon, we'll be playing into the night.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I've got no chance with these on,\" Harry said exasperatedly, waving his glasses.\n\u3000\u3000At that very moment, Hermione appeared at his shoulder; she was holding her cloak over her head and was, inexplicably, beaming.\n\u3000\u3000\"I've had an idea, Harry! Give me your glasses, quick!\"\n\u3000\u3000He handed them to her, and as the team watched in amazement, Hermione tapped them with her wand and said, \"Impervius!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"There!\" she said, handing them back to Harry. \"They'll repel water!\"\n\u3000\u3000Wood looked as though he could have kissed her.\n\u3000\u3000\"Brilliant!\" he called hoarsely after her as she disappeared into the crowd. \"Okay, team, let's go for it!\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione's spell had done the trick. Harry was still numb with cold, still wetter than he'd ever been in his life, but he could see. Full of fresh determination, he urged his broom through the turbulent air, staring in every direction for the Snitch, avoiding a Bludger, ducking beneath Diggory, who was streaking in the opposite direction....\n\u3000\u3000There was another clap of thunder, followed immediately by forked lightning. This was getting more and more dangerous. Harry needed to get the Snitch quickly -\n\u3000\u3000He turned, intending to head back toward the middle of the field, but at that moment, another flash of lightning illuminated the stands, and Harry saw something that distracted him completely , the silhouette of an enormous shaggy black dog, clearly imprinted against the sky, motionless in the topmost, empty row of seats.\n\u3000\u3000Harry's numb hands slipped on the broom handle and his Nimbus dropped a few feet. Shaking his sodden bangs out of his eyes, he squinted back into the stands. The dog had vanished.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry!\" came Wood's anguished yell from the Gryffindor goal posts. \"Harry, behind you!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked wildly around. Cedric Diggory was pelting up the field, and a tiny speck of gold was shimmering in the rain-filled air between them -\n\u3000\u3000With a jolt of panic, Harry threw himself flat to the broornhandle and zoomed toward the Snitch.\n\u3000\u3000\"Come on!\" he growled at his Nimbus as the rain whipped his face. 'Taster!\"\n\u3000\u3000But something odd was happening. An eerie silence was falling across the stadium. The wind, though as strong as ever, was forgetting to roar. It was as though someone had turned off the sound, as though Harry had gone suddenly deaf -- what was going on?\n\u3000\u3000And then a horribly familiar wave of cold swept over him, inside him, just as he became aware of something moving on the field below...\n\u3000\u3000Before he'd had time to think, Harry had taken his eyes off the Snitch and looked down.\n\u3000\u3000At least a hundred dementors, their hidden faces pointing up at him, were standing beneath him. It was as though freezing water were rising in his chest, cutting at his insides. And then he heard it again.... Someone was screaming, screaming inside his head... a woman...\n\u3000\u3000\"Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Stand aside, you silly girl... stand aside, now....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead --\"\n\u3000\u3000Numbing, swirling white mist was filling Harry's brain.... What was he doing? Why was he flying? He needed to help her... She was going to die.... She was going to be murdered....\n\u3000\u3000He was falling, falling through the icy mist.\n\u3000\u3000\"Not Harry! Please... have mercy... have mercy....\n\u3000\u3000A shrill voice was laughing, the woman was screaming, and Harry knew no more.\n\u3000\u3000\"Lucky the ground was so soft.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I thought he was dead for sure.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But he didn't even break his glasses.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry could hear the voices whispering, but they made no sense whatsoever. He didn't have a clue where he was, or how he'd got there, or what he'd been doing before he got there. All he knew was that every inch of him was aching as though it had been beaten.\n\u3000\u3000\"That was the scariest thing I've ever seen in my life.\"\n\u3000\u3000Scariest... the scariest thing... hooded black figures... cold ... screaming...\n\u3000\u3000Harry's eyes snapped open. He was lying in the hospital wing. The Gryffindor Quidditch team, spattered with mud from head to foot, was gathered around his bed. Ron and Hermione were also there, looking as though they'd just climbed out of a swimming pool.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry!\" said Fred, who looked extremely white underneath, the mud. \"How're you feeling?\"\n\u3000\u3000It was as though Harry's memory was on fast forward. The lightning -- the Grim -- the Snitch -- and the dementors...\n\u3000\u3000\"What happened?\" he said, sitting up so suddenly they all gasped.\n\u3000\u3000\"You fell off,\" said Fred. \"Must've been -- what -- fifty feet?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We thought you'd died,\" said Alicia, who was shaking.\n\u3000\u3000Hermione made a small, squeaky noise. Her eyes were extremely bloodshot.\n\u3000\u3000\"But the match,\" said Harry. \"What happened? Are we doing a replay?\"\n\u3000\u3000No one said anything. The horrible truth sank into Harry like a stone.\n\u3000\u3000\"We didn't -- lose?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Diggory got the Snitch,\" said George. \"Just after you fell. He didn't realize what had happened. When he looked back and saw you on the ground, he tried to call it off. Wanted a rematch. But they won fair and square... even Wood admits it.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Where is Wood?\" said Harry, suddenly realizing he wasn't there.\n\u3000\u3000\"Still in the showers,\" said Fred. \"We think he's trying to drown himself.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry put his face to his knees, his hands gripping his hair. Fred grabbed his shoulder and shook it roughly.\n\u3000\u3000\"C'mon, Harry, you've never missed the Snitch before.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"There had to be one time you didn't get it,\" said George.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's not over yet,\" said Fred. \"We lost by a hundred points\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Right? So if Hufflepuff loses to Ravenclaw and we beat Ravenclaw and Slytherin --.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hufflepuff'll have to lose by at least two hundred points,\" said George.\n\u3000\u3000\"But if they beat Ravenclaw...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No Way, Ravenclaw is too good. But if Slytherin loses against Hufflepuff...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It all depends on the points -- a margin of a hundred either way.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry lay there, not saying a word. They had lost... for the first time ever, he had lost a Quidditch match.\n\u3000\u3000After ten minutes or so, Madam Pomfrey came over to tell the team to leave him in peace.\n\u3000\u3000\"We'll come and see you later,\" Fred told him. \"Don't beat yourself up, Harry, you're still the best Seeker we've ever had.\"\n\u3000\u3000The team trooped out, trailing mud behind them. Madam Pomfrey shut the door behind them, looking disapproving. Ron and Hermione moved nearer to Harry's bed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dumbledore was really angry,\" Hermione said in a quaking voice. \"I've never seen him like that before. He ran onto the field as You fell, waved his wand, and you sort of slowed down before you hit the ground. Then he whirled his wand at the dementors. Shot silver stuff at them. They left the stadium right away... He was furious they'd come onto the grounds. We heard him --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Then he magicked you onto a stretcher,\" said Ron. \"And walked up to school with you floating on it. Everyone thought you were --\"\n\u3000\u3000His voice faded, but Harry hardly noticed. He was thinking about what the dementors had done to him... about the screaming voice. He looked up and saw Ron and Hermione lookin, at him so anxiously that he quickly cast around for something matter-of-fact to say.\n\u3000\u3000\"Did someone get my Nimbus?\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron and Hermione looked quickly at each other.\n\u3000\u3000\"Er --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" said Harry, looking from one to the other.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well... when you fell off, it got blown away,\" said Hermione hesitantly.\n\u3000\u3000\"And?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"And it hit -- it hit -- oh, Harry -- it hit the Whomping Willow.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry's insides lurched. The Whomping Willow was a very violent tree that stood alone in the middle of the grounds.\n\u3000\u3000\"And?\" he said, dreading the answer.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, you know the Whomping Willow,\" said Ron. \"It -- it doesn't like being hit.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor Flitwick brought it back just before you came around, said Hermione in a very small voice.\n\u3000\u3000Slowly, she reached down for a bag at her feet, turned it upside down, and tipped a dozen bits of splintered wood and twig onto the bed, the only remains of Harry's faithful, finally beaten broomstick.\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER TEN\n\u3000\u3000THE MARAUDER'S MAP\n\u3000\u3000Madam Pomfrey insisted on keeping Harry in the hospital wing for the rest of the weekend. He didn't argue or complain, but he wouldn't let her throw away the shattered remnants of his Nimbus Two Thousand. He knew he was being stupid, knew that the Nimbus was beyond repair, but Harry couldn't help it; he felt as though he'd lost one of his best friends.\n\u3000\u3000He had a stream of visitors, all intent on cheering him up. Hagrid sent him a bunch of earwiggy flowers that looked like yellow cabbages, and Ginny Weasley, blushing furiously, turned up with a get-well card she had made herself, which sang shrilly unless Harry kept it shut under his bowl of fruit. The Gryffindor team visited again on Sunday morning, this time accompanied by Wood, who told Harry (in a hollow, dead sort of voice) that he didn't blame\n\u3000\u3000him in the slightest. Ron and Hermione left Harry's bedside only at night- But nothing anyone said or did could make Harry feel any better, because they knew only half of what was troubling him.\n\u3000\u3000He hadn't told anyone about the Grim, not even Ron -and Hermione, because he knew Ron would panic and Hermione would scoff. The fact remained, however, that it had now appeared twice, and both appearances had been followed by near-fatal accidents; the first time, he had nearly been run over by the Knight Bus; the second, fallen fifty feet from his broomstick. Was the Grim going to haunt him until he actually died? Was he going to spend the rest of his life looking over his shoulder for the beast?\n\u3000\u3000And then there were the dementors. Harry felt sick and humiliated every time he thought of them. Everyone said the dementors were horrible, but no one else collapsed every time they went near one. No one else heard echoes in their head of their dying parents.\n\u3000\u3000Because Harry knew who that screaming voice belonged to now. He had heard her words, heard them over and over again during the night hours in the hospital wing while he lay awake, staring at the strips of moonlight on the ceiling. When the dementors approached him, he heard the last moments of his mother's life, her attempts to protect him, Harry, from Lord Voldemort, and Voldemort's laughter before he murdered her.... Harry dozed fitfully, sinking into dreams full of clammy, rotted hands and petrified pleading, jerking awake to dwell again on his mother's voice.\n\u3000\u3000It was a relief to return to the noise and bustle of the main school on Monday, where he was forced to think about other things, eve', if he had to endure Draco Malfoys taunting. Malfoy was almost beside himself with glee at Gryffindor's defeat. He had finally taken off his bandages, and celebrated having the full use of both arms again by doing spirited imitations of Harry falling off his broom. Malfoy spent much of their next Potions class doing dementor imitations across the dungeon; Ron finally cracked and flung a large, slippery crocodile heart at Malfoy, which hit him in the face and caused Snape to take fifty points from Gryffindor.\n\u3000\u3000\"If Snape's teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts again, I'm skiving off,\" said Ron as they headed toward Lupin's classroom after lunch. \"Check who's in there, Hermione.\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione peered around the classroom door.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's okay!\"\n\u3000\u3000Professor Lupin was back at work. It certainly looked as though he had been ill. His old robes were hanging more loosely on him and there were dark shadows beneath his eyes; nevertheless, he smiled at the class as they took their seats, and they burst at once into an explosion of complaints about Snape's behavior while Lupin had been ill.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's not fair, he was only filling in, why should he give us homework?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We don't know anything about werewolves two rolls of parchment!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Did you tell Professor Snape we haven't covered them yet?\" Lupin asked, frowning slightly.\n\u3000\u3000The babble broke out again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes, but he said we were really behind he wouldn't listen --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"-- two rolls of parchment!\"\n\u3000\u3000Professor Lupin smiled at the look of indignation on every face.\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't worry. I'll speak to Professor Snape. You don't have to do the essay.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh no,\" said Hermione, looking very disappointed. \"I've already finished it!\"\n\u3000\u3000They had a very enjoyable lesson. Professor Lupin had brought along a glass box containing a hinkypunk, a little one-legged creature who looked as though he were made of wisps of smoke, rather frail and harmless looking.\n\u3000\u3000\"Lures travelers into bogs,\" said Professor Lupin as they took notes. \"You notice the lantern dangling from his hand? Hops ahead -people follow the light -- then --\"\n\u3000\u3000The hinkypunk made a horrible squelching noise against the glass.\n\u3000\u3000When the bell rang, everyone gathered up their things and headed for the door, Harry among them, but --\n\u3000\u3000\"Wait a moment, Harry,\" Lupin called. \"I'd like a word.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry doubled back and watched Professor Lupin covering the hinkypunk's box with a cloth.\n\u3000\u3000\"I heard about the match,\" said Lupin, turning back to his desk and starting to pile books into his briefcase, \"and I'm sorry about your broomstick. Is there any chance of fixing it?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Harry. \"The tree smashed it to bits.\"\n\u3000\u3000Lupin sighed.\n\u3000\u3000\"They planted the Whomping Willow the same year that I arrived at Hogwarts. People used to play a game, trying to get near enough to touch the trunk. In the end, a boy called Davey Gudgeon nearly lost an eye, and we were forbidden to go near it. No broomstick would have a chance.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Did you hear about the dementors too?\" said Harry with difficulty.\n\u3000\u3000Lupin looked at him quickly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes, I did. I don't think any of us have seen Professor Dumbledore that angry. They have been growing restless for some time -- furious at his refusal to let them inside the grounds.... I suppose they were the reason you fell?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" said Harry. He hesitated, and then the question he had to ask burst from him before he could stop himself.\" Why? Why do they affect me like that? Am I just --?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It has nothing to do with weakness,\" said Professor Lupin sharply, as though he had read Harry's mind. \"The dementors affect you worse than the others because there are horrors in your past that the others don't have.\"\n\u3000\u3000A ray of wintery sunlight fell across the classroom, illuminating Lupin's gray hairs and the lines on his young face.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth. They infest the darkest, filthiest places, they glory in decay and despair, they drain peace, hope, and happiness out of the air around them. Even Muggles feel their presence, though they can't see them. Get too near a dementor and every good feeling, every happy memory will be sucked out of you. If it can, the dementor will feed on you long enough to reduce you to something like itself... soul-less and evil. You'll be left with nothing but the worst experiences of your life. And the worst that happened to you, Harry, is enough to make anyone fall off their broom. You have nothing to feel ashamed of.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"When they get near me --\" Harry stared at Lupin's desk, his throat tight. \"I can hear Voldemort murdering my mum.\"\n\u3000\u3000Lupin made a sudden motion with his arm as though to grip Harry's shoulder, but thought better of it. There was a moment's Silence, then --\n\u3000\u3000\"Why did they have to come to the match?\" said Harry bitterly.\n\u3000\u3000\"They're getting hungry,\" said Lupin coolly, shutting his briefcase with a snap. \"Dumbledore won't let them into the school, so their supply of human prey has dried up.... I don't think they could resist the large crowd around the Quidditch field. All that excitement ... emotions running high... it was their idea of a feast.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Azkaban must be terrible,\" Harry muttered. Lupin nodded grimly.\n\u3000\u3000\"The fortress is set on a tiny island, way out to sea, but they don't need walls and water to keep the prisoners in, not when they're all trapped inside their own heads, incapable of a single cheery thought. Most of them go mad within weeks.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But Sirius Black escaped from them,\" Harry said slowly. \"He got away...\"\n\u3000\u3000Lupin's briefcase slipped from the desk; he had to stoop quickly to catch it.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" he said, straightening up, \"Black must have found a way to fight them. I wouldn't have believed it possible.... Dementors are supposed to drain a wizard of his powers if he is left with them too long....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You made that dementor on the train back off,\" said Harry suddenly.\n\u3000\u3000\"There are -- certain defenses one can use,\" said Lupin. \"But there was only one dementor on the train. The more there are, the more difficult it becomes to resist.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What defenses?\" said Harry at once. \"Can you teach me?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't pretend to be an expert at fighting dementors, Harry, quite the contrary...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But if the dementors come to another Quidditch match, I need to be able to fight them --\"\n\u3000\u3000Lupin looked into Harry's determined face, hesitated, then said, \"Well... all right. I'll try and help. But it'll have to wait until next term, I'm afraid. I have a lot to do before the holidays. I chose a very inconvenient time to fall ill.\"\n\u3000\u3000What with the promise of anti-dementor lessons from Lupin, the thought that he might never have to hear his mother's death again, and the fact that Ravenclaw flattened Hufflepuff in their Quidditch match at the end of November, Harry's mood took a definite upturn. Gryffindor were not out of the running after all, although they could not afford to lose another match. Wood became repossessed of his manic energy, and worked his team as hard as ever in the chilly haze of rain that persisted into December. Harry saw no hint of a dementor within the grounds. Dumbledore's anger seemed to be keeping them at their stations at the entrances.\n\u3000\u3000Two weeks before the end of the term, the sky lightened suddenly to a dazzling, opaline white and the muddy grounds were revealed one morning covered in glittering frost. Inside the castle, there was a buzz of Christmas in the air. Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, had already decorated his classroom with shimmering lights that turned out to be real, fluttering fairies. The students were all happily discussing their plans for the holidays. Both Ron and Hermione had decided to remain at Hogwarts, and though Ron said it was because he couldn't stand two weeks with Percy, and Hermione insisted she needed to use the library, Harry wasn't fooled; they were doing it to keep him company, and he was very grateful.\n\u3000\u3000To everyone's delight except Harry's, there was to be another Hogsmeade trip on the very last weekend of the term.\n\u3000\u3000\"We can do all our Christmas shopping there!\" said Hermione. \"Mum and Dad would really love those Toothflossing Stringmints from Honeydukes!\"\n\u3000\u3000Resigned to the fact that he would be the only third year staying behind again, Harry borrowed a copy of Which Broomstick from Wood, and decided to spend the day reading up on the different makes. He had been riding one of the school brooms at team practice, an ancient Shooting Star, which was very slow and jerky; he definitely needed a new broom of his own.\n\u3000\u3000On the Saturday morning of the Hogsmeade trip, Harry bid good-bye to Ron and Hermione, who were wrapped in cloaks and scarves, then turned up the marble staircase alone, and headed back toward Gryffindor Tower. Snow had started to fall outside the windows, and the castle was very still and quiet.\n\u3000\u3000\"Psst -- Harry!\"\n\u3000\u3000He turned, halfway along the third-floor corridor, to see Fred and George peering out at him from behind a statue of a humpbacked, one-eyed witch.\n\u3000\u3000\"What are you doing?\" said Harry curiously. \"How come you're not going to Hogsmeade?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We've come to give you a bit of festive cheer before we go,\" said Fred, with a mysterious wink. \"Come in here....\"\n\u3000\u3000He nodded toward an empty classroom to the left of the one-eyed statue. Harry followed Fred and George inside. George closed the door quietly and then turned, beaming, to look at Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Early Christmas present for you, Harry,\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000Fred pulled something from inside his cloak with a flourish and laid it on one of the desks. It was a large, square, very worn piece of parchment with nothing written on it. Harry, suspecting one of Fred and George's jokes, stared at it.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's that supposed to be?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"This, Harry, is the secret of our success,\" said George, patting the parchment fondly.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's a wrench, giving it to you,\" said Fred, \"but we decided last night, your need's greater than ours.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Anyway, we know it by heart,\" said George. \"We bequeath it to you. We don't really need it anymore.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"And what do I need with a bit of old parchment?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"A bit of old parchment!\" said Fred, closing his eyes with a grimace as though Harry had mortally offended him. \"Explain, George.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well... when we were in our first year, Harry -- young, carefree, and innocent --\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry snorted. He doubted whether Fred and George had ever been innocent.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, more innocent than we are now -- we got into a spot of bother with Filch.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We let off a Dungbomb in the corridor and it upset him for some reason --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"So he hauled us off to his office and started threatening us with the usual --\" detention disembowelment and we couldn't help noticing a drawer in one of his filing cabinets marked Confiscated and Highly Dangerous.\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't tell me --\" said Harry, starting to grin.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, what would you've done?\" said Fred. \"George caused a diversion by dropping another Dungbomb, I whipped the drawer open, and grabbed -- this.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It's not as bad as it sounds, you know,\" said George. \"We don't reckon Filch ever found out how to work it. He probably suspected what it was, though, or he wouldn't have confiscated it.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"And you know how to work it?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh yes,\" said Fred, smirking. \"This little beauty's taught us more than all the teachers in this school.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You're winding me up,\" said Harry, looking at the ragged old bit of parchment.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, are we?\" said George.\n\u3000\u3000He took out his wand, touched the parchment lightly, and said, \"I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.\"\n\u3000\u3000And at once, thin ink lines began to spread like a spider's web from the point that George's wand had touched. They joined each other, they crisscrossed, they fanned into every corner of the parchment; then words began to blossom across the top, great, curly green words, that proclaimed:\n\u3000\u3000Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs\n\u3000\u3000Purveyors of Aids to Magical Mischief-Makers are proud to present THE MARAUDER'S MAP\n\u3000\u3000It was a map showing every detail of the Hogwarts castle and grounds. But the truly remarkable thing were the tiny ink dots moving around it, each labeled with a name in minuscule writing. Astounded, Harry bent over it. A labeled dot in the top left corner showed that Professor Dumbledore was pacing his study; the caretaker's cat, Mrs. Norris, was prowling the second floor; and Peeves the Poltergeist was currently bouncing around the trophy room. And as Harry's eyes traveled up and down the familiar corridors, he noticed something else.\n\u3000\u3000This map showed a set of passages he had never entered. And many of them seemed to lead -\n\u3000\u3000\"Right into Hogsmeade,\" said Fred, tracing one of them with his finger. \"There are seven in all. Now, Filch knows about these four\" -- he pointed them out -- \"but we're sure we're the only ones who know about these. Don't bother with the one behind the mirror on the fourth floor. We used it until last winter, but it's caved in -- completely blocked. And we don't reckon anyone's ever used this one, because the Whomping Willow's planted right over the entrance. But this one here, this one leads right into the cellar of Honeydukes. We've used it loads of times. And as you might've noticed, the entrance is right outside this room, through that one-eyed old crone's hump.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Moony, Wormtaill Padfoot, and Prongs,\" sighed George, patting the heading of the map. \"We owe them so much.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Noble men, working tirelessly to help a new generation of lawbreakers,\" said Fred solemnly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Right,\" said George briskly. \"Don't forget to wipe it after you've used it or anyone can read it,\" Fred said warningly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Just tap it again and say, 'Mischief managed!' And it'll go blank.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"So, young Harry,\" said Fred, in an uncanny impersonation of Percy, \"mind you behave yourself.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"See you in Honeydukes,\" said George, winking.\n\u3000\u3000They left the room, both smirking in a satisfied sort of way.\n\u3000\u3000Harry stood there, gazing at the miraculous map. He watched the tiny ink Mrs. Norris turn left and pause to sniff at something on the floor. If Filch really didn't know... he wouldn't have to pass the dementors at all....\n\u3000\u3000But even as he stood there, flooded with excitement, something Harry had once heard Mr. Weasley say came floating out of his memory.\n\u3000\u3000Never trust anything that can think for itself, if you can't see where it keeps its brain.\n\u3000\u3000This map was one of those dangerous magical objects Mr. Weasley had been warning against.... Aids for Magical Mischief Makers... but then, Harry reasoned, he only wanted to use it to get into Hogsmeade, it wasn't as though he wanted to steal anything or attack anyone... and Fred and George had been using it for years without anything horrible happening....\n\u3000\u3000Harry traced the secret passage to Honeydukes with his finger.\n\u3000\u3000Then, quite suddenly, as though following orders, he rolled up the map, stuffed it inside his robes, and hurried to the door of the classroom. He opened it a couple of inches. There was no one outside. Very carefully, he edged out of the room and behind the statue of the one-eyed witch.\n\u3000\u3000What did he have to do? He pulled out the map again and saw to his astonishment, that a new ink figure had appeared upon it, labeled Harry Potter. This figure was standing exactly where the real Harry was standing, about halfway down the third-floor corridor.\n\u3000\u3000Harry watched carefully. His little Ink self appeared to be tapping the witch with his minute wand. Harry quickly took out his real wand and tapped the statue. Nothing happened. He looked back at the map. The tiniest speech bubble had appeared next to his figure. The word inside said, \"Dissendium.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Dissendium!\" Harry whispered, tapping the stone witch again.\n\u3000\u3000At once, the statue's hump opened wide enough to admit a fairly thin person. Harry glanced quickly up and down the corridor, then tucked the map away again, hoisted himself into the hole headfirst, and pushed himself forward.\n\u3000\u3000He slid a considerable way down what felt like a stone slide, then landed on cold, damp earth. He stood up, looking around. It was\n\u3000\u3000pitch dark. He held up his wand, muttered, \"Lumos! \" and saw that he was in a very narrow, low, earthy passageway. He raised the map, tapped it with the tip of his wand, and muttered, \"Mischief managed!\" The map went blank at once. He folded it carefully, tucked it inside his robes, then, heart beating fast, both excited and apprehensive, he set off.\n\u3000\u3000The passage twisted and turned, more like the burrow of a giant rabbit than anything else. Harry hurried along it, stumbling now and then on the uneven floor, holding his wand out in front of him.\n\u3000\u3000It took ages, but Harry had the thought of Honeydukes to sustain him. After what felt like an hour, the passage began to rise. Panting, Harry sped up, his face hot, his feet very cold.\n\u3000\u3000Ten minutes later, he came to the foot of some worn stone steps, which rose out of sight above him. Careful not to make any noise, Harry began to climb. A hundred steps, two hundred steps, he lost count as he climbed, watching his feet.... Then, without warning, his head hit something hard.\n\u3000\u3000It seemed to be a trapdoor. Harry stood there, massaging the top of his head, listening. He couldn't hear any sounds above him. Very slowly, he pushed the trapdoor open and peered over the edge.\n\u3000\u3000He was in a cellar, which was full of wooden crates and boxes. Harry climbed out of the trapdoor and replaced it -- it blended so perfectly with the dusty floor that it was impossible to tell it was there. Harry crept slowly toward the wooden staircase that led upstairs. Now he could definitely hear voices, not to mention the tinkle of a bell and the opening and shutting of a door.\n\u3000\u3000Wondering what he ought to do, he suddenly heard a door open much closer at hand; somebody was about to come downstairs.\n\u3000\u3000\"And get another box of Jelly Slugs, dear, they've nearly cleaned us out --\" said a woman's voice.\n\u3000\u3000A pair of feet was coming down the staircase. Harry leapt behind an enormous crate and waited for the footsteps to pass. He heard the man shifting boxes against the opposite wall. He might not get another chance --\n\u3000\u3000Quickly and silently, Harry dodged out from his hiding place and climbed the stairs; looking back, he saw an enormous backside and shiny bald head, buried in a box. Harry reached the door at the top of the stairs, slipped through it, and found himself behind the counter of Honeydukes -- he ducked, crept sideways, and then straightened up.\n\u3000\u3000Honeydukes was so crowded with Hogwarts students that no one looked twice at Harry. He edged among them, looking around, and suppressed a laugh as he imagined the look that would spread over Dudley's piggy face if he could see where Harry was now.\n\u3000\u3000There were shelves upon shelves of the most succulent-looking sweets imaginable. Creamy chunks of nougat, shimmering pink squares of coconut ice, fat, honey-colored toffees; hundreds of different kinds of chocolate in neat rows; there was a large barrel of Every Flavor Beans, and another of Fizzing Whizbees, the levitating sherbert balls that Ron had mentioned; along yet another wall were \"Special Effects\" -- sweets: Droobles Best Blowing Gum (which filled a room with bluebell-colored bubbles that refused to pop for days), the strange, splintery Toothflossing Stringmints, tiny black Pepper Imps (\"breathe fire for your friends!\"), Ice Mice (\"hear your teeth chatter and squeak!\"), peppermint creams shaped like toads (\"hop realistically in the stomach!\"), fragile sugar-spun quills, and exploding bonbons.\n\u3000\u3000Harry squeezed himself through a crowd of sixth years and saw a sign hanging in the farthest corner of the shop (UNUSUAL TASTES). Ron and Hermione were standing underneath it, examining a tray of blood-flavored lollipops. Harry sneaked up behind them.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ugh, no, Harry won't want one of those, they're for vampires, I expect,\" Hermione was saying.\n\u3000\u3000\"How about these?\" said Ron, shoving a jar of Cockroach Clusters under Hermione's nose.\n\u3000\u3000\"Definitely not,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000Ron nearly dropped the jar.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry!\" squealed Hermione. \"What are you doing here? How -- how did you --?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Wow!\" said Ron, looking very impressed, \"you've learned to Apparate!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"'Course I haven't,\" said Harry. He dropped his voice so that none of the sixth years could hear him and told them all about the Marauder's Map.\n\u3000\u3000\"How come Fred and George never gave it to me!\" said Ron, outraged. \"I'm their brother!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But Harry isn't going to keep it!\" said Hermione, as though the idea were ludicrous. \"He's going to hand it in to Professor McGonagall, aren't you, Harry?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No, I'm not!\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Are you mad?\" said Ron, goggling at Hermione. \"Hand in something that good?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"If I hand it in, I'll have to say where I got it! Filch would know Fred and George had nicked it!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But what about Sirius Black?\" Hermione hissed. \"He could be using one of the passages on that map to get into the castle! The teachers have got to know!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He can't be getting in through a passage,\" said Harry quickly. \"There are seven secret tunnels on the map, right? Fred and George reckon Filch already knows about four of them. And of the other three -- one of them's caved in, so no one can get through it. one of them's got the Whomping Willow planted over the entrance, so you can't get out of it. And the one I just came through -well - - it's really hard to see the entrance to it down in the cellar, so unless he knew it was there...\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry hesistated. What if Black did know the passage was there?\n\u3000\u3000Ron, however, cleared his throat significantly, and pointed to a notice pasted on the inside of the sweetshop door.\n\u3000\u3000--------BY ORDER OF -------- THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC\n\u3000\u3000Customers are reminded that until further notice, dementors will be patrolling the streets of Hogsmeade every night after sundown. This measure has been put in place for the safety of Hogsmeade residents and will be lifted upon the recapture of Sirius Black. It is therefore advisable that you complete your shopping well before nightfall.\n\u3000\u3000Merry Christmas!\n\u3000\u3000\"See?\" said Ron quietly. \"I'd like to see Black try and break into Honeydukes with dementors swarming all over the village. Anyway, Hermione, the Honeydukes owners would hear a break-in, wouldn't they? They live over the shop!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes, but but --\" Hermoine seemed to be struggling to find another problem. \"Look, Harry still shouldn't be coming into Hogsmeade. He hasn't got a signed form! If anyone finds out, he'll be in so much trouble! And it's not nightfall yet -- what if Sirius Black turns up today? Now?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He'd have a job spotting Harry in this,\" said Ron, nodding through the mullioned windows at the thick, swirling snow. \"Come on, Hermione, it's Christmas. Harry deserves a break.\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione bit her lip, looking extremely worried.\n\u3000\u3000\"Are you going to report me?\" Harry asked her, grinning.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh -- of course not -- but honestly, Harry --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Seen the Fizzing Whizbees, Harry?\" said Ron, grabbing him and leading him over to their barrel. \"And the Jelly Slugs? And the Acid Pops? Fred gave me one of those when I was seven -- it burnt a hole right through my tongue. I remember Mum walloping him with her broomstick.\" Ron stared broodingly into the Acid Pop box. \"Reckon Fred'd take a bit of Cockroach Cluster if I told him they were peanuts?\"\n\u3000\u3000When Ron and Hermione had paid for all their sweets, the three of them left Honeydukes for the blizzard outside.\n\u3000\u3000Hogsmeade looked like a Christmas card; the little thatched cottages and shops were all covered in a layer of crisp snow; there were holly wreaths on the doors and strings of enchanted candles hanging in the trees.\n\u3000\u3000Harry shivered; unlike the other two, he didn't have his cloak. They headed up the street, heads bowed against the wind, Ron and Hermione shouting through their scarves.\n\u3000\u3000\"That's the post office\n\u3000\u3000\"Zonko's is up there --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We could go up to the Shrieking Shack\n\u3000\u3000\"Tell you what,\" said Ron, his teeth chattering, \"shall we go for a butterbeer in the Three Broomsticks?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry was more than willing; the wind was fierce and his hands were freezing, so they crossed the road, and in a few minutes were entering the tiny inn.\n\u3000\u3000It was extremely crowded, noisy, warm, and smoky. A curvy sort of woman with a pretty face was serving a bunch of rowdy warlock' up at the bar.\n\u3000\u3000\"That's Madam Rosmerta,\" said Ron. \"I'll get the drinks, shall I?\" he added, going slightly red.\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Hermione made their way to the back of the room, ,,her, there was a small, vacant table between the window and a handsome Christmas tree, which stood next to the fireplace. Ron came back five minutes later, carrying three foaming tankards of hot butterbeer.\n\u3000\u3000\"Merry Christmas!\" he said happily, raising his tankard.\n\u3000\u3000Harry drank deeply. It was the most delicious thing he'd ever tasted and seemed to heat every bit of him from the inside.\n\u3000\u3000A sudden breeze ruffled his hair. The door of the Three Broomsticks had opened again. Harry looked over the rim of his tankard and choked.\n\u3000\u3000Professors McGonagall and Flitwick had just entered the pub with a flurry of snowflakes, shortly followed by Hagrid, who was deep in conversation with a portly man in a lime-green bowler hat and a pinstriped cloak -- Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic.\n\u3000\u3000In an instant, Ron and Hermione had both placed hands on the top of Harry's head and forced him off his stool and under the table. Dripping with butterbeer and crouching out of sight, Harry clutched his empty tankard and watched the teachers' and Fudge's feet move toward the bar, pause, then turn and walk right toward him.\n\u3000\u3000Somewhere above him, Hermione whispered, Mobiliarbus!\"\n\u3000\u3000The Christmas tree beside their table rose a few inches off the ground, drifted sideways, and landed with a soft thump right in front of their table, hiding them from view. Staring through the dense lower branches, Harry saw four sets of chair legs move back from the table right beside theirs, then heard the grunts and sighs If the teachers and minister as they sat down.\n\u3000\u3000Next he saw another pair of feet, wearing sparkly turquoise high heels, and heard a woman's voice. \"A small gillywater --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Mine,\" said Professor McGonagall's voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"Four pints of mulled mead --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ta, Rosmerta,\" said Hagrid.\n\u3000\u3000\"A cherry syrup and soda with ice and umbrella --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Mmm!\" said Professor Flitwick, smacking his lips.\n\u3000\u3000\"So you'll be the red currant rum, Minister.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Thank you, Rosmerta, m'dear,\" said Fudge's voice. \"Lovely to see you again, I must say. Have one yourself, won't you? Come and join us....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, thank you very much, Minister.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry watched the glittering heels march away and back again. His heart was pounding uncomfortably in his throat. Why hadn't it occurred to him that this was the last weekend of term for the teachers to& And how long were they going to sit there? He needed time to sneak back into Honeydukes if he wanted to return to school tonight.... Hermione's leg gave a nervous twitch next to him.\n\u3000\u3000\"So, what brings you to this neck of the woods, Minister?\" came Madam Rosmerta's voice.\n\u3000\u3000Harry saw the lower part of Fudge's thick body twist in his chair as though he were checking for eavesdroppers. Then he said in a quiet voice, \"What else, m'dear, but Sirius Black? I daresay you heard what happened up at the school at Halloween?\"\n\u3000\u3000I did hear a rumor,\" admitted Madam Rosmerta.\n\u3000\u3000\"Did you tell the whole pub, Hagrid?\" said Professor McGonagall exasperatedly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Do you think Blacks still in the area, Minister?\" whispered Madam Rosmerta.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm sure of it,\" said Fudge shortly.\n\u3000\u3000\"You know that the dementors have searched the whole village twjce?\" said Madam Rosmerta, a slight edge to her voice. \"Scared all my customers away... It's very bad for business, Minister.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Rosmerta, dear, I don't like them any more than you do,\" said Fudge uncomfortably. \"Necessary precaution... unfortunate, but there YOU are.... I've just met some of them. They're in a fury against Dumbledore -- he won't let them inside the castle grounds.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I should think not,\" said Professor McGonagall sharply. \"How are we supposed to teach with those horrors floating around?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hear, hear!\" squeaked tiny Professor Flitwick, whose feet were dangling a foot from the ground.\n\u3000\u3000\"All the same,\" demurred Fudge, \"they are here to protect you all from something much worse.... We all know what Black's capable of...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Do you know, I still have trouble believing it,\" said Madam Rosmerta thoughtfully. \"Of all the people to go over to the Dark Side, Sirius Black was the last I'd have thought... I mean, I remember him when he was a boy at Hogwarts. If you'd told me then what he was going to become, I'd have said you'd had too much mead.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You don't know the half of it, Rosmerta,\" said Fudge gruffly. \"The worst he did isn't widely known.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"The worst?\" said Madam Rosmerta, her voice alive with curiosity, \"Worse than murdering all those poor people, you mean?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I certainly do,\" said Fudge.\n\u3000\u3000\"I ca'A believe that. What could possibly be worse?\" \"You say you remember him at Hogwarts, Rosmerta,\" mur- mured Professor McGonagall. \"Do you remember who his-best friend was?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Naturally,\" said Madam Rosmerta, with a small laugh. \"Never saw one without the other, did you? The number of times I had them in here -- ooh, they used to make me laugh. Quite the double act, Sirius Black and James Potter!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry dropped his tankard with a loud clunk. Ron kicked him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Precisely,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Black and Potter. Ringleaders of their little gang. Both very bright, of course -- exceptionally bright, in fact -- but I don't think we've ever had such a pair of troublemakers --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I dunno,\" chuckled Hagrid. \"Fred and George Weasley could give 'em a run fer their money.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You'd have thought Black and Potter were brothers!\" chimed in Professor Flitwick. \"Inseparable!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Of course they were,\" said Fudge. \"Potter trusted Black beyond all his other friends. Nothing changed when they left school. Black was best man when James married Lily. Then they named him godfather to Harry. Harry has no idea, of course. You can imagine how the idea would torment him.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Because Black turned out to be in league with You-Know-Who?\" whispered Madam Rosmerta.\n\u3000\u3000\"Worse even than that, rn'dear....\" Fudge dropped his voice and proceeded in a sort of low rumble. \"Not many people are aware that the Potters knew You-Know-Who was after them. Dumbledore, who was of course working tirelessly against You-Know-Who, had a number of useful spies. One of them tipped him off, and he alerted James and Lily at once. He advised them to go into hiding. Well, of course, You-Know-Who wasn't an easy person to hide from. Dumbledore told them that their best chance was the Fidelius Charm.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"How does that work?\" said Madam Rosmerta, breathless with interest. Professor Flitwick cleared his throat.\n\u3000\u3000\"An immensely complex spell,\" he said squeakily, \"involving the magical concealment of a secret inside a single, living soul. The information is hidden inside the chosen person, or Secret-Keeper, and is henceforth impossible to find -- unless, of course, the Secret-Keeper chooses to divulge it. As long as the Secret-Keeper refused to speak, You-Know-Who could search the village where Lily and James were staying for years and never find them, not even if he had his nose pressed against their sitting room window!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"So Black was the Potters' Secret-Keeper?\" whispered Madam Rosmerta.\n\u3000\u3000\"Naturally,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"James Potter told Dumbledore that Black would die rather than tell where they were, that Black was planning to go into hiding himself... and yet, Dumbledore remained worried. I remember him offering to be the Potters' Secret-Keeper himself.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He suspected Black?\" gasped Madam Rosmerta.\n\u3000\u3000\"He was sure that somebody close to the Potters had been keeping You-Know-Who informed of their movements,\" said Professor McGonagall darkly. \"Indeed, he had suspected for some time that someone on our side had turned traitor and was passing a lot of information to You-Know-Who.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But James Potter insisted on using Black?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He did,\" said Fudge heavily. \"And then, barely a week after the Fidelius Charm had been performed --\" \"Black betrayed them?\" breathed Madam Rosmerta.\n\u3000\u3000\"He did indeed. Black was tired of his double-agent role, he was ready to declare his support openly for You-Know-Who, and he seems to have planned this for the moment of the Potters' death. But, as we all know, You-Know-Who met his downfall in little Harry Potter. Powers gone, horribly weakened, he fled. And this left Black in a very nasty position indeed. His master had fallen at the very moment when he, Black, had shown his true colors as a traitor. He had no choice but to run for it --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Filthy, stinkin' turncoat!\" Hagrid said, so loudly that half the bar went quiet.\n\u3000\u3000\"Shh!\" said Professor McGonagall.\n\u3000\u3000\"I met him!\" growled Hagrid. \"I musta bin the last ter see him before he killed all them people! It was me what rescued Harry from Lily an' James's house after they was killed! jus' got him outta the ruins, poor little thing, with a great slash across his forehead, an' his parents dead... an' Sirius Black turns up, on that flyin' motorbike he used ter ride. Never occurred ter me what he was doin' there. I didn' know he'd bin Lily an' James's Secret-Keeper. Thought he'd jus' heard the news o' You-Know-Who's attack an' come ter see what he could do. White an' shakin', he was. An' yeh know what I did? I COMFORTED THE MURDERIN' TRAITOR!\" Hagrid roared.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hagrid, please!\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Keep your voice down!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"How was I ter know he wasn' upset abou' Lily an' James? It was You-Know-Who he cared abou'! An' then he says, 'Give Harry ter me, Hagrid, I'm his godfather, I'll look after him --' Ha! But I'd had me orders from Dumbledore, an' I told Black no, Dumbledore said Harry was ter go ter his aunt an' uncle's. Black argued, but in the end he gave in. Told me ter take his motorbike ter get Harry there. 'I won't need it anymore,' he says.\n\u3000\u3000\"I shoulda known there was somethin' fishy goin' on then. He loved that motorbike, what was he givin' it ter me for? Why wouldn' he need it anymore? Fact was, it was too easy ter trace. Dumbledore knew he'd bin the Potters' Secret-Keeper. Black knew he was goin' ter have ter run fer it that night, knew it was a matter o' hours before the Ministry was after him.\n\u3000\u3000\"But what if I'd given Harry to him, eh? I bet he'd 've pitched him off the bike halfway out ter sea. His bes' friends' son! But when a wizard goes over ter the Dark Side, there's nothin' and no one that matters to em anymore....\"\n\u3000\u3000A long silence followed Hagrid's story. Then Madam Rosmerta said with some satisfaction, \"But he didn't manage to disappear, did he? The Ministry of Magic caught up with him next day!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Alas, if only we had,\" said Fudge bitterly. \"It was not we who found him. It was little Peter Pettigrew -- another of the Potters' friends. Maddened by grief, no doubt, and knowing that Black had been the Potters' Secret-Keeper, he went after Black himself.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Pettigrew... that fat little boy who was always tagging around after them at Hogwarts?\" said Madam Rosmerta.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hero-worshipped Black and Potter,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Never quite in their league, talent-wise. I was often rather ,harp with him. You can imagine how I -how I regret that now...\" She sounded as though she had a sudden head cold.\n\u3000\u3000\"There, now, Minerva,\" said Fudge kindly, \"Pettigrew died a hero's death. Eyewitnesses -- Muggles, of course, we wiped their, memories later -- told us how Pettigrew cornered Black. They say he was sobbing, 'Lily and James, Sirius! How could you?' And then he went for his wand. Well, of course, Black was quicker. Blew Pettigrew to smithereens....\"\n\u3000\u3000Professor McGonagall blew her nose and said thickly, \"Stupid boy ... foolish boy... he was always hopeless at dueling... should have left it to the Ministry....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I tell yeh, if I'd got ter Black before little Pettigrew did, I wouldn't 've messed around with wands -- I'd 've ripped him limb -- from -- limb,\" Hagrid growled.\n\u3000\u3000\"You don't know what you're talking about, Hagrid,\" said Fudge sharply. \"Nobody but trained Hit Wizards from the Magical Law Enforcement Squad would have stood a chance against Black once he was cornered. I was Junior Minister in the Department of Magical Catastrophes at the time, and I was one of the first on the scene after Black murdered all those people. I -- I will never forget it. I still dream about it sometimes. A crater in the middle of the street, so deep it had cracked the sewer below. Bodies everywhere. Muggles screaming. And Black standing there laughing, with what was left of Pettigrew in front of him... a heap of bloodstained robes and a few -- a few fragments --\"\n\u3000\u3000Fudge's voice stopped abruptly. There was the sound of five noses being blown.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, there you have it, Rosmerta,\" said Fudge thickly. \"Black was taken away by twenty members of the Magical Law Enforcement 'Squad and Pettigrew received the Order of Merlin, First Class, which I think was some comfort to his poor mother. Blades been in Azkaban ever since.\"\n\u3000\u3000Madam Rosmerta let out a long sigh.\n\u3000\u3000\"Is it true he's mad, Minister?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I wish I could say that he was,\" said Fudge slowly. \"I certainly believe his master's defeat unhinged him for a while. The murder of Pettigrew and all those Muggles was the action of a cornered and desperate man -- cruel... pointless. Yet I met Black on my last inspection of Azkaban. You know, most of the prisoners in there sit muttering to themselves in the dark; there's no sense in them... but I was shocked at how normal Black seemed. He spoke quite rationally to me. It was unnerving. You'd have thought he was merely bored -- asked if I'd finished with my newspaper, cool as you please, said he missed doing the crossword. Yes, I was astounded at how little effect the dementors seemed to be having on him -- and he was one of the most heavily guarded in the place, you know. Dementors outside his door day and night.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But what do you think he's broken out to do?\" said Madam Rosmerta. \"Good gracious, Minister, he isn't trying to rejoin You-Know-Who, is he?\"\n\u3000\u3000I daresay that is his -- er -- eventual plan,\" said Fudge evasively. \"But we hope to catch Black long before that. I must say, You-Know-Who alone and friendless is one thing... but give him back his most devoted servant, and I shudder to think how quickly he'll rise again....\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a small chink of glass on wood. Someone had set down their glass.\n\u3000\u3000\"You know, Cornelius, if you're dining with the headmaster, he'd better head back up to the castle,\" said Professor McGonagall.\n\u3000\u3000One by one, the pairs of feet in front of Harry took the weight of their owners once more; hems of cloaks swung into sight, and Madam Rosemerta's glittering heels disappeared behind the bar. The door of the Three Broomsticks opened again, there was another flurry of snow, and the teachers had disappeared.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry?\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron's and Hermione's faces appeared under the table. They were both staring at him, lost for words.\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER ELEVEN\n\u3000\u3000THE FIREBOLT\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't have a very clear idea of how he had managed to get back into the Honeydukes cellar, through the tunnel, and into the castle once more. All he knew was that the return trip seemed to take no time at all, and that he hardly noticed what he was doing, because his head was still pounding with the conversation he had just heard.\n\u3000\u3000Why had nobody ever told him? Dumbledore, Hagrid, Mr. Weasley, Cornelius Fudge... why hadn't anyone ever mentioned the fact that Harry's parents had died because their best friend had betrayed them?\n\u3000\u3000Ron and Herinione watched Harry nervously all through dintier, not daring to talk about what they'd overheard, because Percy was sitting close by them. When they went upstairs to the crowded common room, it was to find Fred and George had set off half a dozen Dungbombs in a fit of end- of-term high spirits. Harry, who didn't want Fred and George asking him whether he'd reached Hogsmeade or not, sneaked quietly up to the empty dormitory and headed straight for his bedside cabinet. He pushed his books aside and quickly found what he was looking for -- the leather-bound photo album Hagrid had given him two years ago, which was full of wizard pictures of his mother and father. He sat down on his bed, drew the hangings around him, and started turning the pages, searching, until...\n\u3000\u3000He stopped on a picture of his parents' wedding day. There was his father waving up at him, beaming, the untidy black hair Harry had inherited standing up in all directions. There was his mother, alight with happiness, arm in arm with his dad. And there ... that must be him. Their best man... Harry had never given him a thought before.\n\u3000\u3000If he hadn't known it was the same person, he would never have guessed it was Black in this old photograph. His face wasn't sunken and waxy, but handsome, full of laughter. Had he already been working for Voldemort when this picture had been taken? Was he already planning the deaths of the two people next to him? Did he realize he was facing twelve years in Azkaban, twelve years that would make him unrecognizable?\n\u3000\u3000But the dementors don't affect him, Harry thought, staring into the handsome, laughing face. He doesn't have to hear my Min screaming if they get too close -\n\u3000\u3000Harry slammed the album shut, reached over and stuffed it back into his cabinet, took off his robe and glasses and got into bed, making sure the hangings were hiding him from view.\n\u3000\u3000The dormitory door opened.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry?\" said Ron's voice uncertainly.\n\u3000\u3000But Harry still, pretending to be asleep. He heard Ron leave again, and rolled over on his back, his eyes wide open.\n\u3000\u3000A hatred such as he had never known before was coursing through Harry like poison. He could see Black laughing at him through the darkness, as though somebody had pasted the picture from the album over his eyes. He watched, as though somebody was playing him a piece of film, Sirius Black blasting Peter Pettigrew (who resembled Neville Longbottom) into a thousand pieces. He could hear (though having no idea what Black's voice might sound like) a low, excited mutter. \"It has happened, My Lord... the Potters have made me their Secret-Keeper and then came another voice, laughing shrilly, the same laugh that Harry heard inside his head whenever the dementors drew near....\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, you -- you look terrible.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry hadn't gotten to sleep until daybreak. He had awoken to find the dormitory deserted, dressed, and gone down the spiral staircase to a common room that was completely empty except for Ron, who was eating a Peppermint Toad and massaging his stomach, and Hermione, who had spread her homework over three tables.\n\u3000\u3000\"Where is everyone?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Gone! It's the first day of the holidays, remember?\" said Ron, watching Harry closely. \"It's nearly lunchtime; I was going to come and wake you up in a minute.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry slumped into a chair next to the fire. Snow was still falling outside the windows. Crookshanks was spread out in front of the fire like a large, ginger rug.\n\u3000\u3000\"You really don' look well, you know,\" Hermione said, peering anxiously into his face.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm fine,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, listen,\" said Hermione, exchanging a look with Ron, you must be really upset about what we heard yesterday. But the thing is, you mustn't go doing anything stupid.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Like what?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Like trying to go after Black,\" said Ron sharply.\n\u3000\u3000Harry could tell they had rehearsed this conversation while he had been asleep. He didn't say anything.\n\u3000\u3000\"You won't, will you, Harry?\" said Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"Because Black's not worth dying for,\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked at them. They didn't seem to understand at all.\n\u3000\u3000\"D'you know what I see and hear every time a dementor gets too near me?\" Ron and Hermione shook their heads, looking apprehensive. \"I can hear my mum screaming and pleading with Voldemort. And if you'd heard your mum screaming like that, just about to be killed, you wouldn't forget it in a hurry. And if you found out someone who was supposed to be a friend of hers betrayed her and sent Voldemort after her --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"There's nothing you can do!\" said Hermione, looking stricken. \"The dementors will catch Black and he'll go back to Azkaban and -- and serve him right!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You heard what Fudge said. Black isn't affected by Azkaban like normal people are. It's not a punishment for him like it is for the others.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"So what are you saying?\" said Ron, looking very tense. \"You want to -- to kill Black or something?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't be silly,\" said Herinione in a panicky voice. \"Harry doesn't want to kill anyone, do you, Harry?\"\n\u3000\u3000Again, Harry didn't answer. He didn't know what he wanted to do. All he knew was that the idea of doing nothing, while Black was at liberty, was almost more than he could stand.\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy knows,\" he said abruptly. \"Remember what he said to me in Potions? 'If it was me, I'd hunt him down myself... I'd want revenge.\n\u3000\u3000\"You're going to take Malfoy's advice instead of ours?\" said Ron furiously. \"Listen... you know what Pettigrew's mother got back after Black had finished with him? Dad told me -- the Order of Merlin, First Class, and Pettigrew's finger in a box. That was the biggest bit of him they could find. Black's a madman, Harry, and he's dangerous --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Malfoy's dad must have told him,\" said Harry, ignoring Ron. \"He was right in Voldemort's inner circle --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Say You-Know-Who, will you?\" interjected Ron angrily.\n\u3000\u3000\"-- so obviously, the Malfoys knew Black was working for Voldemort --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"-- and Malfoy'd love to see you blown into about a million pieces, like Pettigrew! Get a grip. Malfoy's just hoping you'll get Yourself killed before he has to play you at Quidditch.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, please,\" said Hermione, her eyes now shining with tears, \"Please be sensible. Black did a terrible, terrible thing, but d-don't Put Yourself in danger, it's what Black wants.... Oh, Harry, you'd be Playing right into Black's hands if you went looking for him. Your mum and dad wouldn't want you to get hurt, would they? They'd never want you to go looking for Black!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll never know what they'd have wanted, because thanks to Black, I've never spoken to them,\" said Harry shortly.\n\u3000\u3000There was a silence in which Crookshanks stretched luxuriously flexing his claws. Ron's pocket quivered.\n\u3000\u3000\"Look,\" said Ron, obviously casting around for a change of subject, \"it's the holidays! It's nearly Christmas! Let's -- let's go down and see Hagrid. We haven't visited him for ages!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No!\" said Hermione quickly. \"Harry isn't supposed to leave the castle, Ron --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, let's go,\" said Harry, sitting up, \"and I can ask him how come he never mentioned Black when he told me all about my parents!\"\n\u3000\u3000Further discussion of Sirius Black plainly wasn't what Ron had had in mind.\n\u3000\u3000\"Or we could have a game of chess, he said hastily, \"or Gobstones. Percy left a set --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No, let's visit Hagrid,\" said Harry firmly.\n\u3000\u3000So they got their cloaks from their dormitories and set off through the portrait hole (\"Stand and fight, you yellow-bellied mongrels!\"), down through the empty castle and out through the oak front doors.\n\u3000\u3000They made their way slowly down the lawn, making a shallow trench in the glittering, powdery snow, their socks and the hems of their cloaks soaked and freezing. The Forbidden Forest looked as though it had been enchanted, each tree smattered with silver, and Hagrid's cabin looked like an iced cake.\n\u3000\u3000Ron knocked, but there was no answer.\n\u3000\u3000\"He's not out, is he?\" said Hermione, who was shivering under her cloak.\n\u3000\u3000Ron had his ear to the door.\n\u3000\u3000\"There's a weird noise,\" he said. \"Listen -- is that Fang?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Hermione put their ears to the door too. From inside the cabin came a series of low, throbbing moans.\n\u3000\u3000\"Think we'd better go and get someone?\" said Ron nervously.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hagrid!\" called Harry, thumping the door. \"Hagrid, are you in there.\n\u3000\u3000There was a sound of heavy footsteps, then the door creaked open. Hagrid stood there with his eyes red and swollen, tears splashing down the front of his leather vest.\n\u3000\u3000\"YWve heard?\" he bellowed, and he flung himself onto Harry's neck.\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid being at least twice the size of a normal man, this was no laughing matter. Harry, about to collapse under Hagrid's weight, was rescued by Ron and Hermione, who each seized Hagrid under an arm and heaved him back into the cabin. Hagrid allowed himself to be steered into a chair and slumped over the table, sobbing uncontrollably, his face glazed with tears that dripped down into his tangled beard.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hagrid, what is it?\" said Hermione, aghast.\n\u3000\u3000Harry spotted an official-looking letter lying open on the table.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's this, Hagrid?\"\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid's sobs redoubled, but he shoved the letter toward Harry, who Picked it up and read aloud:\n\u3000\u3000Dear Mr. Hagrid,\n\u3000\u3000Further to our inquiry into the attack by a hippogriff on a student in your class, we have accepted the assurances of Professor Dumbledore that you bear no responsibility for the regrettable incident.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, that's okay then, Hagrid!\" said Ron, clapping Hagrid oil the shoulder. But Hagrid continued to sob, and waved one of his gigantic hands, inviting Harry to read on.\n\u3000\u3000However, we must register our concern about the hippogriff in question. We have decided to uphold the official complaint of Mr. Lucius Malfoy, and this matter will therefore be taken to the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures. The hearing will take place on April 20th, and we ask you to present yourself and your hippogriff at the Committee's offices in London on that date. In the meantime, the hippogriff should be kept tethered and isolated. Yours in fellowship...\n\u3000\u3000There followed a list of the school governors.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh,\" said Ron. \"But you said Buckbeak isn't a bad hippogriff, Hagrid. I bet he'll get off\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeh don' know them gargoyles at the Committee fer the Disposal o' Dangerous Creatures!\" choked Hagrid, wiping his eyes on his sleeve. \"They've got it in fer interestin' creatures!\"\n\u3000\u3000A sudden sound from the corner of Hagrid's cabin made Harry, Ron, and Hermione whip around. Buckbeak the hippogriff was lying in the corner, chomping on something that was oozing blood all over the floor.\n\u3000\u3000\"I couldn' leave him tied up out there in the snow!\" choked Hagrid. \"All on his own! At Christmas.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another. They had never seen eye to eye with Hagrid about what he called \"interesting creatures\" and other people called \"terrifying monsters.\" Or' the other hand, there didn't seem to be any particular harm in Buckbeak. In fact, by Hagrid's usual standards, he was positively cute.\n\u3000\u3000\"You'll have to put up a good strong defense, Hagrid,\" said Hermione, sitting down and laying a hand on Hagrid's massive forearm. \"I'm sure you can prove Buckbeak is safe.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Won't make no diff'rence!\" sobbed Hagrid. \"Them Disposal devils, they're all in Lucius Malfoy's pocket! Scared o' him! Ad if I lose the case, Buckbeak --\"\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid drew his finger swiftly across his throat, then gave a great wail and lurched forward, his face in his arms.\n\u3000\u3000\"What about Dumbledore, Hagrid?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"He's done more'n enough fer me already,\" groaned Hagrid. \"Got enough on his plate what with keepin' them dementors outta the castle, an' Sirius Black lurkin' around --\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron and Hermione looked quickly at Harry, as though expecting him to start berating Hagrid for not telling him the truth about Black. But Harry couldn't bring himself to do it, not now that he saw Hagrid so miserable and scared.\n\u3000\u3000\"Listen, Hagrid,\" he said, \"you can't give up. Hermione's right, You just need a good defense. You can call us as witnesses --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm sure I've read about a case of hippogriff-baiting,\" said Hermione thoughtfully, \"where the hippogriff got off I'll look it up for you, Hagrid, and see exactly what happened.\"\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid howled still more loudly. Harry and Hermione looked at Ron to help them.\n\u3000\u3000\"Er -- shall I make a cup of tea?\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000Harry stared at him.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's what my mum does whenever someone's upset,\" Ron muttered, shrugging.\n\u3000\u3000At last, after many more assurances of help, with a steaming mug of tea in front of him, Hagrid blew his nose on a handkerchief the size of a tablecloth and said, \"Yer right. I can' afford to go ter pieces. Gotta pull meself together.....\n\u3000\u3000Fang the boarhound came timidly out from under the table and laid his head on Hagrid's knee.\n\u3000\u3000\"I've not bin meself lately,\" said Hagrid, stroking Fang with one hand and mopping his face with the other. \"Worried abou' Buckbeak, an' no one likin' me classes --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We do like them!\" lied Hermione at once.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, they're great!\" said Ron, crossing his fingers under the table. \"Er -- how are the flobberworms?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Dead,\" said Hagrid gloomily. \"Too much lettuce.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh no!\" said Ron, his lip twitching.\n\u3000\u3000\"An' them dementors make me feel ruddy terrible an' all,\" said Hagrid, with a sudden shudder. \"Gotta walk past 'em ev'ry time I want a drink in the Three Broomsticks. 'S like bein' back in Azkaban --\"\n\u3000\u3000He fell silent, gulping his tea. Harry, Ron, and Hermione watched him breathlessly. They had never heard Hagrid talk about his brief spell in Azkaban before. After a pause, Hermione said timidly, \"Is it awful in there, Hagrid?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeh've no idea,\" said Hagrid quietly. \"Never bin anywhere like it. Thought I was goin' mad. Kep' goin' over horrible stuff in me mind... the day I got expelled from Hogwarts... day me dad died... day I had ter let Norbert go....\"\n\u3000\u3000His eyes filled with tears. Norbert was the baby dragon Hagrid had once won in a game of cards.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeh can' really remember who yeh are after a while. An' yeh can' really see the point o' livin' at all. I used ter hope I'd jus' die in me sleep. When they let me out, it was like bein' born again, ev'rythin' I came floodin' back, it was the bes' feelin' in the world. Mind, the dementors weren't keen on lettin' me go.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But you were innocent!\" said Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid snorted.\n\u3000\u3000\"Think that matters to them? They don' care. Long as they've got a couple o' hundred humans stuck there with 'em, so they can leech all the happiness out of 'em, they don' give a damn who's guilty an' who's not.\"\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid went quiet for a moment, staring into his tea. Then he said quietly, \"Thought o' jus' letting Buckbeak go... tryin' ter make him fly away... but how d'yeh explain ter a hippogriff it's gotta go inter hidin'? An' -an' I'm scared o' breakin' the law....\" He looked up at them, tears leaking down his face again. \"I don' ever want ter go back ter Azkaban.\"\n\u3000\u3000The trip to Hagrid's, though far from fun, had nevertheless had the effect Ron and Hermione had hoped. Though Harry had by no means forgotten about Black, he couldn't brood constantly on revenge if he wanted to help Hagrid win his case against the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures. He, Ron, and Hermione went to the library the next day and returned to the empty common room laden with books that might help prepare a defense for Buckbeak. The three of them sat in front of the roaring fire, slowly turning the pages of dusty volumes about famous cases If marauding beasts, speaking occasionally when they ran across something relevant.\n\u3000\u3000\"Here's something... there was a case in 1722... but the hippogriff was convicted -- ugh, look what they did to it, that's disgusting --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"This might help, look -- a manticore savaged someone in 1296, and they let the manticore off -- oh -- no, that was only because everyone was too scared to go near it.\"\n\u3000\u3000Meanwhile, in the rest of the castle, the usual magnificent Christmas decorations had been put up, despite the fact that hardly any of the students remained to enjoy them. Thick streamers of holly and mistletoe were strung along the corridors, mysterious lights shone from inside every suit of armor, and the Great Hall was filled with its usual twelve Christmas trees, glittering with golden stars. A powerful and delicious smell of cooking pervaded the corridors, and by Christmas Eve, it had grown so strong that even Scabbers poked his nose out of the shelter of Ron's pocket to sniff hopefully at the air.\n\u3000\u3000On Christmas morning, Harry was woken by Ron throwing his pillow at him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oy! Presents!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry reached for his glasses and put them on, squinting through the semi-darkness to the foot of his bed, where a small heap of parcels had appeared. Ron was already ripping the paper off his own presents.\n\u3000\u3000'Another sweater from Mum... maroon again... see if you've got one.\n\u3000\u3000Harry had. Mrs. Weasley had sent him a scarlet sweater with the Gryffindor lion knitted on the front, also a dozen home-baked mince pies, some Christmas cake, and a box of nut brittle. As he moved all these things aside, he saw a long, thin package lying underneath.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's that?\" said Ron, looking over, a freshly unwrapped pair of maroon socks in his hand.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dunno...\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry ripped the parcel open and gasped as a magnificent, gleaming broomstick rolled out onto his bedspread. Ron dropped his socks and jumped off his bed for a closer look.\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't believe it,\" he said hoarsely.\n\u3000\u3000It was a Firebolt, identical to the dream broom Harry had gone to see every day in Diagon Alley. Its handle glittered as he picked it up. He could feel it vibrating and let go; it hung in midair, unsupported, at exactly the right height for him to mount it. His eyes moved from the golden registration number at the top of the handle, right down to the perfectly smooth, streamlined birch twigs that made up the tail.\n\u3000\u3000\"Who sent it to you?\" said Ron in a hushed voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"Look and see if there's a card,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000Ron ripped apart the Firebolt's wrappings.\n\u3000\u3000\"Nothing! Blimey, who'd spend that much on you?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well,\" said Harry, feeling stunned, \"I'm betting it wasn't the Dursleys.\"\n\u3000\u3000I bet it was Dumbledore,\" said Ron, now walking around and around the Firebolt, taking in every glorious inch. \"He sent you the Invisibility Cloak anonymously....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That was my dad's, though,\" said Harry. \"Dumbledore was just Passing it on to me. He wouldn't spend hundreds of Galleons on me. He can't go giving students stuff like this --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That's why he wouldn't say it was from him!\" said Ron. \"In case some git like Malfoy said it was favoritism. Hey, Harry\" -- Ron gave a great whoop of laughter -- \"Malfoy! Wait till he sees you on this! He'll be sick as a pig! This is an international standard broom, this is!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I can't believe this,\" Harry muttered, running a hand along the Firebolt, while Ron sank onto Harry's bed, laughing his head off at the thought of Malfoy. \"Who -?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I know,\" said Ron, controlling himself, \"I know who it could've been -- Lupin!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" said Harry, now starting to laugh himself \"Lupin? Listen, if he had this much gold, he'd be able to buy himself some new robes.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, but he likes you,\" said Ron. \"And he was away when your Nimbus got smashed, and he might've heard about it and decided to visit Diagon Alley and get this for you --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What d'you mean, he was away?\" said Harry. \"He was ill when I was playing in that match.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, he wasn't in the hospital wing,\" said Ron. \"I was there, cleaning out the bedpans on that detention from Snape, remember?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry frowned at Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"I can't see Lupin affording something like this.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What're you two laughing about?\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione had just come in, wearing her dressing gown and carrying Crookshanks, who was looking very grumpy, with a string of tinsel tied around his neck.\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't bring him in here!\" said Ron, hurriedly snatching Scabbers from the depths of his bed and stowing him in his pajama pocket.\n\u3000\u3000But Hermione wasn't listening. She dropped Crookshanks onto Seamus's empty bed and stared, open-mouthed, at the Firebolt.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, Harry! Who sent you that?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No idea,\" said Harry. \"There wasn't a card or anything with it.\"\n\u3000\u3000To his great surprise, Hermione did not appear either excited or intrigued by the news. On the contrary, her face fell, and she bit her lip.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's the matter with you?\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't know,\" said Hermione slowly, \"but it's a bit odd, isn't it? I mean, this is supposed to be quite a good broom, isn't it?\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron sighed exasperatedly.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's the best broom there is, Hermione,\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000\"So it must've been really expensive....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Probably cost more than all the Slytherins' brooms put together,\" said Ron happily.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well... who'd send Harry something as expensive as that, and not even tell him they'd sent it?\" said Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"Who cares?\" said Ron impatiently. \"Listen, Harry, can I have a go on it? Can I?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't think anyone should ride that broom just yet!\" said Hermione shrilly.\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron looked at her.\n\u3000\u3000\"What d'you think Harry's going to do with it -- sweep the floor?\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000But before Hermione could answer, Crookshanks sprang from Seamus's bed, right at Ron's chest.\n\u3000\u3000\"GET -- HIM -- OUT -- OF -- HERE!\" Ron bellowed as Crookshanks's claws ripped his pajamas and Scabbers attempted a wild escape over his shoulder. Ron seized Scabbers by the tail and aimed a misjudged kick at Crookshanks that hit the trunk at the end of Harry's bed, knocking it over and causing Ron to hop up and down, howling with pain.\n\u3000\u3000Crookshanks's fur suddenly stood on end. A shrill, tint,, whistling was filling the room. The Pocket Sneakoscope had become dislodged from Uncle Vernon's old socks and was whirling and gleaming on the floor.\n\u3000\u3000I forgot about that!\" Harry said, bending down and picking up the Sneakoscope. I never wear those socks if I can help it....\n\u3000\u3000The Sneakoscope whirled and whistled in his palm. Crookshanks was hissing and spitting at it.\n\u3000\u3000\"You'd better take that cat out of here, Hermione,\" said Ron furiously, sitting on Harry's bed nursing his toe. \"Can't you shut that thing up?\" he added to Harry as Hermione strode out of the room, Crookshanks's yellow eyes still fixed maliciously on Ron.\n\u3000\u3000Harry stuffed the Sneakoscope back inside the socks and threw it back into his trunk. All that could be heard now were Ron's stifled moans of pain and rage. Scabbers was huddled in Ron's hands. It had been a while since Harry had seen him out of Ron's pocket, and he was unpleasantly surprised to see that Scabbers, once so fat, was now very skinny; patches of fur seemed to have fallen out too\n\u3000\u3000\"He's not looking too good, is he?\" Harry said.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's stress!\" said Ron. \"He'd be fine if that big stupid furball left him alone!\"\n\u3000\u3000But Harry, remembering what the woman at the Magical Menagerie had said about rats living only three years, couldn't help feeling that unless Scabbers had powers he had never revealed, he was reaching the end of his life. And despite Ron's frequent conplaints that Scabbers was both boring and useless, he was sure Ron would be very miserable if Scabbers died.\n\u3000\u3000Christmas spirit was definitely thin on the ground in the Gryffindor common room that morning. Hermione had shut Crookshanks in her dormitory, but was furious with Ron for trying to kick him; Ron was still fuming about Crookshanks's fresh attempt to eat Scabbers. Harry gave up trying to make them talk to each other and devoted himself to examining the Firebolt, which he had brought down to the common room with him. For some reason this seemed to annoy Hermione as well; she didn't say anything, but she kept looking darkly at the broom as though it too had been criticizing her cat.\n\u3000\u3000At lunchtime they went down to the Great Hall, to find that the House tables had been moved against the walls again, and that a single table, set for twelve, stood in the middle of the room. Professors Dumbledore, McGonagall, Snape, Sprout, and Flitwick were there, along with Filch, the caretaker, who had taken off his usual brown coat and was wearing a very old and rather moldy- looking tailcoat. There were only three other students, two extremely nervous-looking first years and a sullen-faced Slytherin fifth year.\n\u3000\u3000\"Merry Christmas!\" said Dumbledore as Harry, Ron, and Hermione approached the table. \"As there are so few of us, it seemed foolish to use the House tables.... Sit down, sit down!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down side by side at the end of the table.\n\u3000\u3000\"Crackers!\" said Dumbledore enthusiastically, offering the end of a large silver noisemaker to Snape, who took it reluctantly and tugged. With a bang like a gunshot, the cracker flew apart to reveal a large, pointed witchs hat topped with a stuffed vulture.\n\u3000\u3000Harry, remembering the boggart, caught Ron's eye and they both grinned; Snape's mouth thinned and he pushed the hat toward Dumbledore, who swapped it for his wizard's hat at once.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dig in!\" he advised the table, beaming around.\n\u3000\u3000As Harry was helping himself to roast potatoes, the doors of the Great Hall opened again. It was Professor Trelawney, gliding toward them as though on wheels. She had put on a green sequined dress in honor of the occasion, making her look more than ever like a glittering, oversized dragonfly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sibyll, this is a pleasant surprise!\" said Dumbledore, standing up.\n\u3000\u3000\"I have been crystal gazing, Headmaster,\" said Professor Trelawney in her mistiest, most faraway voice, \"and to my astonishment, I saw myself abandoning my solitary luncheon and coming to join you. Who am I to refuse the promptings of fate? I at once hastened from my tower, and I do beg you to forgive my lateness....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Certainly, certainly,\" said Dumbledore, his eyes twinkling. \"Let me draw you up a chair --\"\n\u3000\u3000And he did indeed draw a chair in midair with his wand, which revolved for a few seconds before falling with a thud between Professors Snape and McGonagall. Professor Trelawney, however, did not sit down; her enormous eyes had been roving around the table, and she suddenly uttered a kind of soft scream.\n\u3000\u3000I dare not, Headmaster! If I join the table, we shall be thirteen! Nothing could be more unlucky! Never forget that when thirteen dine together, the first to rise will be the first to die!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We'll risk it, Sibyll,\" said Professor McGonagall inpatiendy. \"Do sit down, the turkey's getting stone cold.\"\n\u3000\u3000Professor Trelawney hesitated, then lowered herself into the empty chair, eyes shut and mouth clenched tight, as though expecting a thunderbolt to hit the table. Professor McGonagall poked a large spoon into the nearest tureen.\n\u3000\u3000\"Tripe, Sibyll?\"\n\u3000\u3000Professor Trelawney ignored her. Eyes open again, she looked around once more and said, \"But where is dear Professor Lupin?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm afraid the poor fellow is ill again,\" said Dumbledore, indicating that everybody should start serving themselves. \"Most unfortunate that it should happen on Christmas Day.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But surely you already knew that, Sibyll?\" said Professor McGonagall, her eyebrows raised.\n\u3000\u3000Professor Trelawney gave Professor McGonagall a very cold look.\n\u3000\u3000\"Certainly I knew, Minerva, 11 she said quietly. \"But one does not parade the fact that one is All- Knowing. I frequently act as though I am not possessed of the Inner Eye, so as not to make others nervous.\n\u3000\u3000\"That explains a great deal,\" said Professor McGonagall tartly.\n\u3000\u3000Professor Trelawney's voice suddenly became a good deal less misty.\n\u3000\u3000\"If you must know, Minerva, I have seen that poor Professor Lupin will not be with us for very long. He seems aware, himself, that his time is short. He positively fled when I offered to crystal gaze for him --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Imagine that,\" said Professor McGonagall dryly.\n\u3000\u3000I doubt,\" said Dumbledore, in a cheerful but slightly raised voice, which put an end to Professor McGonagall and Professor Trelawney's conversation, \"that Professor Lupin is in any immediate danger. Severus, you've made the potion for him again?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes, Headmaster,\" said Snape. \"W -- what?\" said Harry, scrambling to his feet. \"Why?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It will need to be checked for jinxes,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Of course, I'm no expert, but I daresay Madam Hooch and Professor Flitwick will strip it down --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Strip it down?\" repeated Ron, as though Professor McGonagall was mad.\n\u3000\u3000\"It shouldn't take more than a few weeks,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"You will have it back if we are sure it is jinx-free.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"There's nothing wrong with it!\" said Harry, his voice shaking slightly. \"Honestly, Professor --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You can't know that, Potter,\" said Professor McGonagall, quite kindly, \"not until you've flown it, at any rate, and I'm afraid that is out of the question until we are certain that it has not been tampered with. I shall keep you informed.\"\n\u3000\u3000Professor McGonagall turned on her heel and carried the Firebolt out of the portrait hole, which closed behind her. Harry stood staring after her, the tin of High-Finish Polish still clutched in his hands. Ron, however, rounded on Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"What did you go running to McGonagall for?\n\u3000\u3000Hermione threw her book aside. She was still pink in the face, but stood up and faced Ron defiantly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Because I thought -- and Professor McGonagall agrees with me -- that that broom was probably sent to Harry by Sirius Black!\"\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER TWELVE\n\u3000\u3000THE PATRONUS\n\u3000\u3000Harry knew that Hermione had meant well, but that didn't stop him from being angry with her. He had been the owner of the best broom in the world for a few short hours, and now, because of her interference, he didn't know whether he would ever see it again. He was positive that there was nothing wrong with the Firebolt now, but what sort of state would it be in once it had been subjected to all sorts of anti-jinx tests?\n\u3000\u3000Ron was furious with Hermione too. As far as he was concerned, the stripping-down of a brand- new Firebolt was nothing less than criminal damage. Hermione, who remained convinced that she had acted for the best, started avoiding the common room. Harry and Ron supposed she had taken refuge in the library and didn't try to persuade her to come back. All in all, they were glad when the rest of the school returned shortly after New Year, and Gryffindor Tower became crowded and noisy again. Wood sought Harry out on the night before term started.\n\u3000\u3000\"Had a good Christmas?\" he said, and then, without waiting for an answer, he sat down, lowered his voice, and said, \"I've been, doing some thinking over Christmas, Harry. After last match, you know. If the dementors come to the next one... I mean... we can't afford you to -- well --\"\n\u3000\u3000Wood broke off, looking awkward.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm working on it,\" said Harry quickly. \"Professor Lupin said he'd train me to ward off the dementors. We should be starting this week. He said he'd have time after Christmas.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah,\" said Wood, his expression clearing. \"Well, in that case -- I really didn't want to lose you as Seeker, Harry. And have you ordered a new broom yet?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"What! You'd better get a move on, you know -- you can't ride that Shooting Star against Ravenclaw!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He got a Firebolt for Christmas,\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"A Firebolt? No! Seriously? A -- a real Firebolt?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't get excited, Oliver,\" said Harry gloomily. \"I haven't got it anymore. It was confiscated.\" And he explained all about how the Firebolt was now being checked for jinxes.\n\u3000\u3000\"Jinxed? How could it be jinxed?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Sirius Black\" Harry said wearily. \"He's supposed to be after me. So McGonagall reckons he might have sent it.\"\n\u3000\u3000Waving aside the information that a famous murderer was after his Seeker, Wood said, \"But Black couldn't have bought a Firebolt! He's on the run! The whole country's on the lookout for him! How could he just walk into Quality Quidditch Supplies and buy a broomstick?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I know,\" said Harry, \"but McGonagall still wants to strip it down --\"\n\u3000\u3000Wood went pale.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll go and talk to her, Harry,\" he promised. \"I'll make her see reason.... A Firebolt... a real Firebolt, on our team... She wants Gryffindor to win as much as we do.... I'll make her see sense. A Firebolt...\"\n\u3000\u3000Classes started again the next day. The last thing anyone felt like doing was spending two hours on the grounds on a raw January morning, but Hagrid had provided a bonfire full of salamanders for their enjoyment, and they spent an unusually good lesson collecting dry wood and leaves to keep the fire blazing while the flame-loving lizards scampered up and down the crumbling, white-hot logs. The first Divination lesson of the new term was much less fun; Professor Trelawney was now teaching them palmistry, and she lost no time in informing Harry that he had the shortest life line she had ever seen.\n\u3000\u3000It was Defense Against the Dark Arts that Harry was keen to get to; after his conversation with Wood, he wanted to get started on his anti-dementor lessons as soon as possible.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah yes,\" said Lupin, when Harry reminded him of his promise at the end of class. \"Let me see... how about eight o'clock on Thursday evening? The History of Magic classroom should be large enough.... I'll have to think carefully about how we're going to do this.... We can't bring a real dementor into the castle to practice on....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Still looks ill, doesn't he?\" said Ron as they walked down the corridor, heading to dinner. \"What d'you reckon's the matter with him?\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a loud and impatient \"tuh\" from behind them. It was Hermione, who had been sitting at the feet of a suit of armor, repacking her bag, which was so full of books it wouldn't close.\n\u3000\u3000\"And what are you tutting at us for?\" said Ron irritably.\n\u3000\u3000\"Nothing,\" said Hermione in a lofty voice, heaving her bag back over her shoulder.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes, you were,\" said Ron. \"I said I wonder what's wrong with Lupin, and you --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, isn't it obvious?\" said Hermione, with a look of maddening superiority.\n\u3000\u3000\"If you don't want to tell us, don't,\" snapped Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Fine,\" said Hermione haughtily, and she marched off.\n\u3000\u3000\"She doesn't know,\" said Ron, staring resentfully after Hermione. \"She's just trying to get us to talk to her again.\"\n\u3000\u3000At eight o'clock on Thursday evening, Harry left Gryffindor Tower for the History of Magic classroom. It was dark and empty when he arrived, but he lit the lamps with his wand and had waited only five minutes when Professor Lupin turned up, carrying a large packing case, which he heaved onto Professor Binn's desk.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's that?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Another boggart,\" said Lupin, stripping off his cloak. \"I've been combing the castle ever since Tuesday, and very luckily, I found this one lurking inside Mr. Filch's filing cabinet. It's the nearest we'll get to a real dementor. The boggart will turn into a dementor when he sees you, so we'll be able to practice on him. I can store him in my office when we're not using him; there's a cupboard under my desk he'll like.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Okay,\" said Harry, trying to sound as though he wasn't apprehensive at all and merely glad that Lupin had found such a good substitute for a real dementor.\n\u3000\u3000\"So...\" Professor Lupin had taken out his own wand, and indicated that Harry should do the same. \"The spell I am going to try and teach you is highly advanced magic, Harry -- well beyond ordinary Wizarding Level. It is called the Patronus Charm.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"How does it work?\" said Harry nervously.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, when it works correctly, It conjures up a Patronus,\" said Lupin, \"which is a kind of anti- dementor -- a guardian that acts as a shield between you and the dementor.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry had a sudden vision of himself crouching behind a Hagridsized figure holding a large club. Professor Lupin continued, \"The Patronus is a kind of positive force, a projection of the very things that the dementor feeds upon -- hope, happiness, the desire to survive -- but it cannot feel despair, as real humans can, so the dementors can't hurt it. But I must warn you, Harry, that the charm might be too advanced for you. Many qualified wizards have difficulty with it.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What does a Patronus look like?\" said Harry curiously.\n\u3000\u3000\"Each one is unique to the wizard who conjures it.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"And how do you conjure it?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"With an incantation, which will work only if you are concentrating, with all your might, on a single, very happy memory.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry cast his mind about for a happy memory. Certainly, nothing that had happened to him at the Dursleys' was going to do. Finally, he settled on the moment when he had first ridden a broomstick.\n\u3000\u3000\"Right,\" he said, trying to recall as exactly as possible the wonderful, soaring sensation of his stomach.\n\u3000\u3000\"The incantation is this --\" Lupin cleared his throat. \"Expecto patronum!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Expecto patronum, \" Harry repeated under his breath, \"expecto patronum.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Concentrating hard on your happy memory?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh -- yeah --\" said Harry, quickly forcing his thoughts back to that first broom ride. \"Expecto patrono -- no, patronum -- sorry -- expecto patronum, expecto patronum\"\n\u3000\u3000Something whooshed suddenly out of the end of his wand; it looked like a wisp of silvery gas.\n\u3000\u3000\"Did you see that?\" said Harry excitedly. \"Something happened!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Very good,\" said Lupin, smiling. \"Right, then -- ready to try it on a dementor?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" Harry said, gripping his wand very tightly, and moving into the middle of the deserted classroom. He tried to keep his mind on flying, but something else kept intruding.... Any second now, he might hear his mother again... but he shouldn't think that, or he would hear her again, and he didn't want to... or did he?\n\u3000\u3000Lupin grasped the lid of the packing case and pulled.\n\u3000\u3000A dementor rose slowly from the box, its hooded face turned toward Harry, one glistening, scabbed hand gripping its cloak. The lamps around the classroom flickered and went out. The dementor stepped from the box and started to sweep silently toward Harry, drawing a deep, rattling breath. A wave of piercing cold broke over him --\n\u3000\u3000\"Expecto patronum!\" Harry yelled. \"Expecto patronum! Expecto --\"\n\u3000\u3000But the classroom and the dementor were dissolving.... Harry was failing again through thick white fog, and his mother's voice was louder than ever, echoing inside his head -- \"Not Harry! Not Harry! please -- I'll do anything!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Stand aside. Stand aside, girl!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry jerked back to life. He was lying flat on his back on the floor. The classroom lamps were alight again. He didn't have to ask what had happened.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sorry,\" he muttered, sitting up and feeling cold sweat trickling down behind his glasses.\n\u3000\u3000\"Are you all right?\" said Lupin.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes...\" Harry pulled himself up on one of the desks and leaned against it.\n\u3000\u3000\"Here --\" Lupin handed him a Chocolate Frog. \"Eat this before we try again. I didn't expect you to do it your first time; in fact, I would have been astounded if you had.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It's getting worse,\" Harry muttered, biting off the Frog's head. \"I could hear her louder that time -- and him -- Voldemort\n\u3000\u3000Lupin looked paler than usual. ,\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, if you don't want to continue, I will more than understand --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I do!\" said Harry fiercely, stuffing the rest of the Chocolate Frog into his mouth. \"I've got to! What if the dementors turn up at our match against Ravenclaw? I can't afford to fall off again. If we lose this game we've lost the Quidditch Cup!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"All right then... \" said Lupin. \"You might want to select 'other memory, a happy memory, I mean, to concentrate on.... That one doesn't seem to have been strong enough....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry thought hard and decided his feelings when Gryffindor had won the House Championship last year had definitely qualified as very happy. He gripped his wand tightly again and took up his position in the middle of the classroom.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ready?\" said Lupin, gripping the box lid.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ready,\" said Harry; trying hard to fill his head with happy thoughts about Gryffindor winning, and not dark thoughts about what was going to happen when the box opened.\n\u3000\u3000\"Go!\" said Lupin, pulling off the lid. The room went icily cold and dark once more. The dementor glided forward, drawing its breath; one rotting hand was extending toward Harry -\n\u3000\u3000\"Expecto patronum!\" Harry yelled. \"Expecto patronum! Expecto Pat --\"\n\u3000\u3000White fog obscured his senses... big, blurred shapes were moving around him... then came a new voice, a man's voice, shouting, panicking --\n\u3000\u3000\"Lily, take Harry and go! It's him! Go! Run! I'll hold him off --\"\n\u3000\u3000The sounds of someone stumbling ftom a room -- a door bursting open -- a cackle of high- pitched laughter --\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry! Harry... wake up....\"\n\u3000\u3000Lupin was tapping Harry hard on the face. This time it was a minute before Harry understood why he was lying on a dusty classroom floor.\n\u3000\u3000\"I heard my dad,\" Harry mumbled. \"That's the first time I've ever heard him -- he tried to take on Voldemort himself, to give my mum time to run for it....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry suddenly realized that there were tears on his face mingling with the sweat. He bent his face as low as possible, wiping them off on his robes, pretending to do up his shoelace, so that Lupin wouldn't see.\n\u3000\u3000\"You heard James?\" said Lupin in a strange voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah...\" Face dry, Harry looked up. \"Why -- you didn't know my dad, did you?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I -- I did, as a matter of fact,\" said Lupin. \"We were friends at Hogwarts. Listen, Harry -- perhaps we should leave it here for tonight. This charm is ridiculously advanced.... I shouln't have suggested putting you through this....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No!\" said Harry. He got up again. \"I'll have one more go! I'm not thinking of happy enough things, that's what it is.... Hang on....\"\n\u3000\u3000He racked his brains. A really, really happy memory... one that he could turn into a good, strong Patronus...\n\u3000\u3000The moment when he'd first found out he was a wizard, and would be leaving the Dursleys for Hogwarts! If that wasn't a happy memory, he didn't know what was.... Concentrating very hard on how he had felt when he'd realized he'd be leaving Privet Drive, Harry got to his feet and faced the packing case once more.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ready?\" said Lupin, who looked as though he were doing this against his better judgment. \"Concentrating hard? All right -- go!\"\n\u3000\u3000He pulled off the lid of the case for the third time, and the dementor rose out of it; the room fell cold and dark\n\u3000\u3000'EXPECTO PATRONUM!\" Harry bellowed. \"EXPECTO PATRONUM! EXPECTO PATRONUM! \"\n\u3000\u3000The screaming inside Harry's head had started again -- except this time, it sounded as though it were coming from a badly tuned radio -- softer and louder and softer again -- and he could still see the dementor -- it had halted -- and then a huge, silver shadow came bursting out of the end of Harry's wand, to hover between him and the dementor, and though Harry's legs felt like water, he was still on his feet -- though for how much longer, he wasn't sure --\n\u3000\u3000\"Riddikulus!\" roared Lupin, springing forward.\n\u3000\u3000There was a loud crack, and Harry's cloudy Patronus vanished along with the dementor; he sank into a chair, feeling as exhausted as if he'd just run a mile, and felt his legs shaking. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Professor Lupin forcing the boggart back into the packing case with his wand; it had turned into a silvery orb again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Excellent!\" Lupin said, striding over to where Harry sat. \"Excellent, Harry! That was definitely a start!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Can we have another go? Just one more go?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Not now,\" said Lupin firmly. \"You've had enough for one night. Here --\"\n\u3000\u3000He handed Harry a large bar of Honeydukes' best chocolate.\n\u3000\u3000\"Eat the lot, or Madam Pomfrey will be after my blood. Same time next week?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Okay,\" said Harry. He took a bite of the chocolate and watched Lupin extinguishing the lamps that had rekindled with the disappearance of the dementor. A thought had just occurred to him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor Lupin?\" he said. \"If you knew my dad, you must've known Sirius Black as well.\"\n\u3000\u3000Lupin turned very quickly.\n\u3000\u3000\"What gives you that idea?\" he said sharply.\n\u3000\u3000\"Nothing -- I mean, I just knew they were friends at Hogwarts too....\"\n\u3000\u3000Lupin's face relaxed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes, I knew him,\" he said shortly. \"Or I thought I did. You'd better be off, Harry, it's getting late.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry left the classroom, walking along the corridor and around a corner, then took a detour behind a suit of armor and sank down on its plinth to finish his chocolate, wishing he hadn't mentioned Black, as Lupin was obviously not keen on the subject. Then Harry's thoughts wandered back to his mother and father...\n\u3000\u3000He felt drained and strangely empty, even though he was so full of chocolate. Terrible though it was to hear his parents' last moments replayed inside his head, these were the only times Harry had heard their voices since he was a very small child. But he'd never be able to produce a proper Patronus if he half wanted to hear his parents again....\n\u3000\u3000\"They're dead,\" he told himself sternly. \"They're dead and listening to echoes of them won't bring them back. You'd better get a grip on yourself if you want that Quidditch Cup.\"\n\u3000\u3000He stood up, crammed the last bit of chocolate into his mouth, and headed back to Gryffindor Tower.\n\u3000\u3000Ravenclaw played Slytherin a week after the start of term. Slytherin won, though narrowly. According to Wood, this was good news for Gryffindor, who would take second place if they beat Ravenclaw too. He therefore increased the number of team practices to five a leek. This meant that with Lupin's anti-dementor classes, which in themselves were more draining than six Quidditch practices, Harry had just one night a week to do all his homework. Even so, he was showing the strain nearly as much as Hermione, whose immense workload finally seemed to be getting to her. Every night, without fail, Hermione was to be seen in a corner of the common room, several tables spread with books, Arithmancy charts, rune dictionaries, diagrams of Muggles lifting heavy objects, and file upon file of extensive notes; she barely spoke to anybody and snapped when she was interrupted.\n\u3000\u3000\"How's she doing it?\" Ron muttered to Harry one evening as Harry sat finishing a nasty essay on Undetectable Poisons for Snape. Harry looked up. Hermione was barely visible behind a tottering pile of books.\n\u3000\u3000\"Doing what?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Getting to all her classes!\" Ron said. \"I heard her talking to Professor Vector, that Arithmancy witch, this morning. They were going on about yesterday's lesson, but Hermione can't 've been there, because she was with us in Care of Magical Creatures! And Ernie McMillan told me she's never missed a Muggle Studies class, but half of them are at the same time as Divination, and she's never missed one of them either!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't have time to fathom the mystery of Hermione's impossible schedule at the moment; he really needed to get on with Snape's essay. Two seconds later, however, he was interrupted again, this time by Wood.\n\u3000\u3000\"Bad news, Harry. I've just been to see Professor McGonagall about the Firebolt. She -- er -- got a bit shirty with me. Told m' I'd got my priorities wrong. Seemed to think I cared more about winning the Cup than I do about you staying alive. Just because I told her I didn't care if it threw you off, as long as you caught the Snitch first.\" Wood shook his head in disbelief. \"Honestly, the way she was yelling at me... you'd think I'd said something terrible... then I asked her how much longer she was going to keep it. He screwed up his face and imitated Professor McGonagall's severe voice. 'As long as necessary, Wood'... I reckon it's time you ordered a new broom, Harry. There's an order form at the back of Which Broomstick... you could get a Nimbus Two Thousand and One, like Malfoy's got.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm not buying anything Malfoy thinks is good,\" said Harry flatly.\n\u3000\u3000January faded imperceptibly into February, with no change in the bitterly cold weather. The match against Ravenclaw was drawing nearer and nearer, but Harry still hadn't ordered a new broom. He was now asking Professor McGonagall for news of the Firebolt after every Transfiguration lesson, Ron standing hopefully at his shoulder, Hermione rushing past with her face averted.\n\u3000\u3000\"No, Potter, you can't have it back yet,\" Professor McGonagall told him the twelfth time this happened, before he'd even opened his mouth. \"We've checked for most of the usual curses, but Professor Flitwick believes the broom might be carrying a Hurling Hex. I shall tell you once we've finished checking it. Now, please stop badgering me.\"\n\u3000\u3000To make matters even worse, Harry's anti-dementor lessons were not going nearly as well as he had hoped. Several sessions on, he was able to produce an indistinct, silvery shadow every time the boggart-dementor approached him, but his Patronus was too feeble to drive the dementor away. All it did was hover, like a semitransparent cloud, draining Harry of energy as he fought to keep it there. Harry felt angry with himself, guilty about his secret desire to hear his parents' voices again.\n\u3000\u3000\"You're expecting too much of yourself,\" said Professor Lupin, sternly in their fourth week of practice. \"For a thirteen-year-old wizard, even an indistinct Patronus is a huge achievement. You aren't passing out anymore, are you?\"\n\u3000\u3000I thought a Patronus would -- charge the dementors down or something,\" said Harry dispiritedly. \"Make them disappear --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"The true Patronus does do that,\" said Lupin. \"But you've achieved a great deal in a very short space of time. If the dementors put in an appearance at your next Quidditch match, You will be able to keep them at bay long enough to get back to the ground.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You said it's harder if there are loads of them,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"I have complete confidence in you,\" said Lupin, smiling. \"Here -- you've earned a drink - something from the Three Broomsticks. You won't have tried it before --\"\n\u3000\u3000He pulled two bottles out of his briefcase.\n\u3000\u3000\"Butterbeer!\" said Harry, without thinking. \"Yeah, I like that stuff!\"\n\u3000\u3000Lupin raised an eyebrow.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh -Ron and Hermione brought me some back from Hogsmeade,\" Harry lied quickly.\n\u3000\u3000I see,\" said Lupin, though he still looked slightly suspicious. \"Well -- let's drink to a Gryffindor victory against Ravenclaw! Not that I'm supposed to take sides, as a teacher... \" he added hastily\n\u3000\u3000They drank the butterbeer in silence, until Harry voiced something he'd been wondering for a while.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's under a dementor's hood?\"\n\u3000\u3000Professor Lupin lowered his bottle thoughtfully.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hmmm... well, the only people who really know are in no condition to tell us. You see, the dementor lowers its hood only to use its last and worst weapon.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What's that?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"They call it the Dementor's Kiss,\" said Lupin, with a slightly twisted smile. \"It's what dementors do to those they wish to destroy utterly. I suppose there must be some kind of mouth under there, because they clamp their jaws upon the mouth of the victim and -- and suck out his soul.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry accidentally spat out a bit of butterbeer.\n\u3000\u3000\"What -- they kill --?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh no,\" said Lupin. \"Much worse than that. You can exist without your soul, you know, as long as your brain and heart are still working. But you'll have no sense of self anymore, no memory, no. .. anything. There's no chance at all of recovery. You'll just exist. As an empty shell. And your soul is gone forever... lost.\"\n\u3000\u3000Lupin drank a little more butterbeer, then said, \"It's the fate that awaits Sirius Black. It was in the Daily Prophet this morning. The Ministry have given the dementors permission to perform it if they find him.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry sat stunned for a moment at the idea of someone having their soul sucked out through their mouth. But then he thought of Black.\n\u3000\u3000\"He deserves it,\" he said suddenly.\n\u3000\u3000\"You think so?\" said Lupin lightly. \"Do you really think anyone deserves that?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" said Harry defiantly. \"For... for some things...\"\n\u3000\u3000He would have liked to have told Lupin about the conversation he'd overheard about Black in the Three Broomsticks, about Black betraying his mother and father, but it would have involved revealing that he'd gone to Hogsmeade without permission, and he knew Lupin wouldn't be very impressed by that. So he finished his butterbeer, thanked Lupin, and left the History of Magic classroom.\n\u3000\u3000Harry half wished that he hadn't asked what was under a dementor's hood, the answer had been so horrible, and he was so lost in unpleasant thoughts of what it would feel like to have your soul sucked out of you that he walked headlong into Professor McGonagall halfway up the stairs.\n\u3000\u3000\"Do watch where you're going, Potter!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Sorry, Professor --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I've just been looking for you in the Gryffindor common room, Well, here it is, we've done everything we could think of, and there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with it at all. You've got a very good friend somewhere, Potter....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry's jaw dropped. She was holding out his Firebolt, and it looked as magnificent as ever.\n\u3000\u3000\"I can have it back?\" Harry said weakly. \"Seriously?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Seriously,\" said Professor McGonagall, and she was actually smiling. \"I daresay you'll need to get the feel of it before Saturday's match, won't you? And Potter -- do try and win, won't you? Or we'll be out of the running for the eighth year. in a row, as Professor Snape was kind enough to remind me only last night....\"\n\u3000\u3000Speechless, Harry carried the Firebolt back upstairs toward Gryffindor Tower. As he turned a corner, he saw Ron dashing toward him, grinning from ear to ear.\n\u3000\u3000\"She gave it to You? Excellent! Listen, can I still have a go on it? Tomorrow?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah... anything,\" said Harry, his heart lighter than it had been in a month. \"You know what -- we should make up with Hermione.... She was only trying to help....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, all right,\" said Ron. \"She's in the common room how working, for a change --\"\n\u3000\u3000They turned into the corridor to Gryffindor Tower and saw Neville Longbottom, pleading with Sir Cadogan, who seemed to be refusing him entrance.\n\u3000\u3000\"I wrote them down!\" Neville was saying tearfully. \"But I must've dropped them somewhere!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"A likely tale!\" roared Sir Cadogan. Then, spotting Harry and Ron: \"Good even, my fine young yeomen! Come clap this loon in irons. He is trying to force entry to the chambers within!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, shut up,\" said Ron as he and Harry drew level with Neville.\n\u3000\u3000\"I've lost the passwords!\" Neville told them miserably. \"I made him tell me what passwords he was going to use this week, because he keeps changing them, and now I don't know what I've done with them!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oddsbodikins,\" said Harry to Sir Cadogan, who looked extremely disappointed and reluctantly swung forward to let them into the common room. There was a sudden, excited murmur as every head turned and the next moment, Harry was surrounded by people exclaiming over his Firebolt.\n\u3000\u3000\"Where'd you get it, Harry?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Will you let me have a go?\" \"Have you ridden it yet, Harry?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ravenclaw'll have no chance, they're all on Cleansweep Sevens!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Can I just hold it, Harry?\"\n\u3000\u3000After ten minutes or so, during which the Firebolt was Passed around and admired from every angle, the crowd dispersed and Harry and Ron had a clear view of Hermione, the only person who hadn't rushed over to them, bent over her work and carefully avoiding their eyes. Harry and Ron approached her table and at last, she looked up.\n\u3000\u3000\"I got it back,\" said Harry, grinning at her and holding up the Firebolt.\n\u3000\u3000\"See, Hermione? There wasn't anything wrong with it!\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well -- there might have been!\" said Hermione. \"I mean, at least you know now that it's safe!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, I suppose so,\" said Harry. \"Id better put it upstairs.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll take it!\" said Ron eagerly. \"I've got to give Scabbers his rat tonic.\"\n\u3000\u3000He took the Firebolt and, holding it as if it were made of glass, carried it away up the boys' staircase.\n\u3000\u3000\"Can I sit down, then?\" Harry asked Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"I suppose so,\" said Hermione, moving a great stack of parchment off a chair.\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked around at the cluttered table, at the long Arithmancy essay on which the ink was still glistening, at the even longer Muggle Studies essay (\"Explain Why Muggles Need Electricity\" and at the rune translation Hermione was now poring over.\n\u3000\u3000\"How are you getting through all this stuff?\" Harry asked her.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, well -- you know -- working hard,\" said Hermione. Close-up, Harry saw that she looked almost as tired as Lupin.\n\u3000\u3000\"Why don't you just drop a couple of subjects?\" Harry asked, watching her lifting books as she searched for her rune dictionary.\n\u3000\u3000\"I couldn't do that!\" said Hermione, looking scandalized.\n\u3000\u3000\"Arithmancy looks terrible,\" said Harry, picking up a very complicated-looking number chart.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh no, it's wonderful!\" said Hermione earnestly. \"It's my favorite subject! It's --\"\n\u3000\u3000But exactly what was wonderful about Arithmancy, Harry never found out. At that precise moment, a strangled yell echoed down the boys' staircase. The whole common room fell silent, staring, petrified, at the entrance. Then came hurried footsteps, growing louder and louder -- and then Ron came leaping into view, dragging with him a bedsheet.\n\u3000\u3000\"LOOK!\" he bellowed, striding over to Hermione's table.\n\u3000\u3000\"LOOK!\" he yelled, shaking the sheets in her face.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron, what --?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"SCABBERS! LOOK! SCABBERS!\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione was leaning away from Ron, looking utterly bewildered. Harry looked down at the sheet Ron was holding. There was something red on it. Something that looked horribly like --\n\u3000\u3000\"BLOOD!\" Ron yelled into the stunned silence. \"HE'S GONE! AND YOU KNOW WHAT WAS ON THE FLOOR?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"N -- no,\" said Hermione in a trembling voice.\n\u3000\u3000Ron threw something down onto Hermione's rune translation. Hermione and Harry leaned forward. Lying on top of the weird, spiky shapes were several long, ginger cat hairs.\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER THIRTEEN\n\u3000\u3000GRYFFINDOR VERSUS RAVENCLAW\n\u3000\u3000It looked like the end of Ron and Hermione's friendship. Each was so angry with the other that Harry couldn't see how they'd ever make up.\n\u3000\u3000Ron was enraged that Hermione had never taken Crookshanks's attempts to eat Scabbers seriously, hadn't bothered to keep a close enough watch on him, and was still trying to pretend that Crookshanks was innocent by suggesting that Ron look for Scabbers under all the boys' beds. Hermione, meanwhile, maintained fiercely that Ron had no proof that Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers, that the ginger hairs might have been there since Christmas, and that Ron had been prejudiced against her cat ever since Crookshanks had landed on Ron's head in the Magical Menagerie.\n\u3000\u3000Personally, Harry was sure that Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers, and when he tried to point out to Hermione that the evidence all pointed that way, she lost her temper with Harry too.\n\u3000\u3000\"Okay, side with Ron, I knew you would!\" she said shrilly. \"First the Firebolt, now Scabbers, everything's my fault, isn't it! just leave me alone, Harry, I've got a lot of work to do!\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron had taken the loss of his rat very hard indeed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Come on, Ron, you were always saying how boring Scabbers was,\" said Fred bracingly. \"And he's been off-color for ages, he was wasting away. It was probably better for him to snuff it quickly -- one swallow -- he probably didn't feel a thing.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Fred!\" said Ginny indignantly.\n\u3000\u3000\"All he did was eat and sleep, Ron, you said it yourself,\" said George.\n\u3000\u3000\"He bit Goyle for us once!\" Ron said miserably. \"Remember, Harry?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, that's true,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"His finest hour,\" said Fred, unable to keep a straight face. \"Let the scar on Goyle's finger stand as a lasting tribute to his memory. Oh, come on, Ron, get yourself down to Hogsmeade and buy a new rat, what's the point of moaning?\"\n\u3000\u3000In a last-ditch attempt to cheer Ron up, Harry persuaded him to come along to the Gryffindor team's final practice before the Ravenclaw match, so that he could have a ride on the Firebolt after they'd finished. This did seem to take Ron's mind off Scabbers for a moment (\"Great! Can I try and shoot a few goals on it?\") so they set off for the Quidditch field together.\n\u3000\u3000Madam Hooch, who was still overseeing Gryffindor practices to keep an eye on Harry, was just as impressed with the Firebolt as everyone else had been. She took it in her hands before takeoff and gave them the benefit of her professional opinion.\n\u3000\u3000\"Look at the balance on it! If the Nimbus series has a fault, it's a slight list to the tail end -- you often find they develop a drag after a few years. They've updated the handle too, a bit slimmer than the Cleansweeps, reminds me of the old Silver Arrows -- a Pity they've stopped making them. I learned to fly on one, and a very fine old broom it was too....\"\n\u3000\u3000She continued in this vein for some time, until Wood said, \"Er -- Madam Hooch? Is it okay if Harry has the Firebolt back? We need to practice....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh -- right -- here you are, then, Potter,\" said Madam Hooch. \"I'll sit over here with Weasley....\"\n\u3000\u3000She and Ron left the field to sit in the stadium, and the Gryffindor team gathered around Wood for his final instructions for tomorrow's match.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, I've just found out who Ravenclaw is playing as Seeker. It's Cho Chang. She's a fourth year, and she's pretty good.... I really hoped she wouldn't be fit, she's had some problems with injuries....\" Wood scowled his displeasure that Cho Chang had made a full recovery, then said, \"On the other hand, she rides a Comet Two Sixty, which is going to look like a joke next to the Firebolt.\" He gave Harry's broom a look of fervent admiration, then said, \"Okay, everyone, let's go -- \"\n\u3000\u3000And at long last, Harry mounted his Firebolt, and kicked off from the ground.\n\u3000\u3000It was better than he'd ever dreamed. The Firebolt turned with the lightest touch; it seemed to obey his thoughts rather than his grip; it sped across the field at such speed that the stadium turned into a green-and-gray blur; Harry turned it so sharply that Alicia Spinnet screamed, then he went into a perfectly controlled dive, brushing the grassy field with his toes before rising thirty, forty, fifty feet into the air again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, I'm letting the Snitch out!\" Wood called.\n\u3000\u3000Harry turned and raced a Bludger toward the goal posts; he outstripped it easily, saw the Snitch dart out from behind Wood, and within ten seconds had caught it tightly in his hand.\n\u3000\u3000The team cheered madly. Harry let the Snitch go again, gave it a minute's head start, then tore after it, weaving in and out of the others; he spotted it lurking near Katie Bell's knee, looped her easily, and caught it again.\n\u3000\u3000It was the best practice ever; the team, inspired by the presence of the Firebolt in their midst, performed their best moves faultlessly, and by the time they hit the ground again, Wood didn't have a single criticism to make, which, as George Weasley pointed out, was a first.\n\u3000\u3000\"I can't see what's going to stop us tomorrow!\" said Wood. \"Not unless -- Harry, you've sorted out your dementor problem, haven't you?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah,\" said Harry, thinking of his feeble Patronus and wishing it were stronger.\n\u3000\u3000\"The dementors won't turn up again, Oliver. Dumbledore'd go ballistic,\" said Fred confidently.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, let's hope not,\" said Wood. \"Anyway -- good work, everyone. Let's get back to the tower... turn in early --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm staying out for a bit; Ron wants a go on the Firebolt,\" Harry told Wood, and while the rest of the team headed off to the locker rooms, Harry strode over to Ron, who vaulted the barrier to the stands and came to meet him. Madam Hooch had fallen asleep in her seat.\n\u3000\u3000\"Here you go,\" said Harry, handing Ron the Firebolt.\n\u3000\u3000Ron, an expression of ecstasy on his face, mounted the broom and zoomed off into the gathering darkness while Harry walked around the edge of the field, watching him. Night had fallen before Madam Hooch awoke with a start, told Harry and Ron off for not waking her, and insisted that they go back to the castle.\n\u3000\u3000Harry shouldered the Firebolt and he and Ron walked out of the shadowy stadium, discussing the Firebolt's superbly smooth action, its phenomenal acceleration, and its pinpoint turning. They were halfway toward the castle when Harry, glancing to his left, saw something that made his heart turn over -- a pair of eyes, gleaming out of the darkness.\n\u3000\u3000Harry stopped dead, his heart banging against his ribs.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's the matter?\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000Harry pointed. Ron pulled out his wand and muttered, \"Lumos!\"\n\u3000\u3000A beam of light fell across the grass, hit the bottom of a tree, and illuminated its branches; there, crouching among the budding leaves, was Crookshanks.\n\u3000\u3000\"Get out of here!\" Ron roared, and he stooped down and seized a stone lying on the grass, but before he could do anything else, Crookshanks had vanished with one swish of his long ginger tail.\n\u3000\u3000\"See?\" Ron said furiously, chucking the stone down again. \"She's still letting him wander about wherever he wants -- probably washing down Scabbers with a couple of birds now....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't say anything. He took a deep breath as relief seeped through him; he had been sure for a moment that those eyes had belonged to the Grim. They set off for the castle once more. slightly ashamed of his moment of panic, Harry didn't say anything to Ron -- nor did he look left or right until they had reached the well-lit entrance hall.\n\u3000\u3000Harry went down to breakfast the next morning with the rest of the boys in his dormitory, all of whom seemed to think the Firebolt deserved a sort of guard of honor. As Harry entered the Great Hall, heads turned in the direction of the Firebolt, and there was a good deal of excited muttering. Harry saw, with enormous satisfaction, that the Slytherin team were all looking thunderstruck.\n\u3000\u3000\"Did you see his face?\" said Ron gleefully, looking back at Malfay. \"He can't believe it! This is brilliant!\"\n\u3000\u3000Wood, too, was basking in the reflected glory of the Firebolt.\n\u3000\u3000\"Put it here, Harry,\" he said, laying the broom in the middle of the table and carefully turning it so that its name faced upward. People from the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables were soon coming over to look. Cedric Diggory came over to congratulate Harry on having acquired such a superb replacement for his Nimbus, and Percy's Ravenclaw girlfriend, Penelope Clearwater, asked if she could actually hold the Firebolt.\n\u3000\u3000\"Now, now, Penny, no sabotage!\" said Percy heartily as she examined the Firebolt closely. \"Penelope and I have got a bet on,\" he told the team. \"Ten Galleons on the outcome of the match!\"\n\u3000\u3000Penelope put the Firebolt down again, thanked Harry, and went back to her table.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry -- make sure you win,\" said Percy, in an urgent whisper. \"I haven't got ten Galleons. Yes, I'm coming, Penny!\" And-he bustled off to join her in a piece of toast.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sure you can manage that broom, Potter?\" said a cold, drawling voice.\n\u3000\u3000Draco Malfoy had arrived for a closer look, Crabbe and Coyle right behind him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, reckon so,\" said Harry casually.\n\u3000\u3000\"Got plenty of special features, hasn't it?\" said Malfoy, eyes glittering maliciously. \"Shame it doesn't come with a parachute -- in case you get too near a dementor.\"\n\u3000\u3000Crabbe and Goyle sniggered.\n\u3000\u3000\"Pity you can't attach an extra arm to yours, Malfoy,\" said Harry. \"Then it could catch the Snitch for you.\"\n\u3000\u3000The Gryffindor team laughed loudly. Malfoy's pale eyes narrowed, and he stalked away. They watched him rejoin the rest of the Slytherin team, who put their heads together, no doubt asking Malfoy whether Harry's broom really was a Firebolt.\n\u3000\u3000At a quarter to eleven, the Gryffindor team set off for the locker rooms. The weather couldn't have been more different from their match against Hufflepuff. It was a clear, cool day with a very light breeze; there would be no visibility problems this time, and Harry, though nervous, was starting to feel the excitement only a Quidditch match could bring. They could hear the rest of the school moving into the stadium beyond. Harry took off his black school robes, removed his wand from his pocket, and stuck it inside the T-shirt he was going to wear under his Quidditch robes. He only hoped he wouldn't need it. He wondered suddenly whether Professor Lupin was in the crowd, watching.\n\u3000\u3000\"You know what we've got to do,\" said Wood as they prepared to leave the locker rooms. \"If we lose this match, we're out of the running. just -- just fly like you did in practice yesterday, and we'll be okay!\"\n\u3000\u3000They walked out onto the field to tumultuous applause. The Ravenclaw team, dressed in blue, were already standing in the middle of the field. Their Seeker, Cho Chang, was the only girl on their team. She was shorter than Harry by about a head, and Harry couldn't help noticing, nervous as he was, that she was extremely pretty. She smiled at Harry as the teams faced each other behind their captains, and he felt a slight lurch in the region of his stomach that he didn't think had anything to do with nerves.\n\u3000\u3000\"Wood, Davies, shake hands,\" Madam Hooch said briskly, and Wood shook hands with the Ravenclaw Captain.\n\u3000\u3000\"Mount your brooms... on my whistle... three -- two -- one --\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry kicked off into the air and the Firebolt zoomed higher and faster than any other broom; he soared around the stadium and began squinting around for the Snitch, listening all the while to the commentary, which was being provided by the Weasley twins' friend Lee Jordan.\n\u3000\u3000\"They're off, and the big excitement this match is the Firebolt that Harry Potter is flying for Gryffindor. According to Which Broomstick, the Firebolt's going to be the broom of choice for the national teams at this year's World Championship --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Jordan, would you mind telling us what's going on in the match?\" interrupted Professor McGonagall's voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"Right you are, Professor -- just giving a bit of background information -- the Firebolt, incidentally, has a built-in auto-brake and --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Jordan!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Okay, okay, Gryffindor in possession, Katie Bell of Gryffindor, heading for goal...\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry streaked past Katie in the opposite direction, gazing around for a glint of gold and noticing that Cho Chang was tailing him closely. She was undoubtedly a very good flier -- she kept cutting across him, forcing him to change direction.\n\u3000\u3000\"Show her your acceleration, Harry!\" Fred yelled as he whooshed past in pursuit of a Bludger that was aiming for Alicia.\n\u3000\u3000Harry urged the Firebolt forward as they rounded the Ravenclaw goal posts and Cho fell behind. Just as Katie succeeded in scoring the first goal of the match, and the Gryffindor end of the field went wild, he saw it -- the Snitch was close to the ground, flitting near one of the barriers.\n\u3000\u3000Harry dived; Cho saw what he was doing and tore after him -- Harry was speeding up, excitement flooding him; dives were his speciality, he was ten feet away --\n\u3000\u3000Then a Bludger, hit by one of the Ravenclaw Beaters, came pelting out of nowhere; Harry veered off course, avoiding it by an inch, and in those few, crucial seconds, the Snitch had vanished.\n\u3000\u3000There was a great \"Ooooooh\" of disappointment from the Gryffindor supporters, but much applause for their Beater from the Ravenclaw end. George Weasley vented his feelings by hitting the second Bludger directly at the offending Beater, who was forced to roll right over in midair to avoid it.\n\u3000\u3000\"Gryffindor leads by eighty points to zero, and look at that Firebolt go! Potter's really putting it through its paces now, see it turn -- Chang's Comet is just no match for it, the Firebolt's precision- balance is really noticeable in these long --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"JORDAN! ARE YOU BEING PAID TO ADVERTISE FIREBOLTS? GET ON WITH THE COMMENTARY!\"\n\u3000\u3000Ravenclaw was pulling back; they had now scored three goals, which put Gryffindor only fifty points ahead -- if Cho got the Snitch before him, Ravenclaw would win. Harry dropped lower, narrowly avoiding a Ravenclaw Chaser, scanning the field frantically -- a glint of gold, a flutter of tiny wings -- the Snitch was circling the Gryffindor goal post --\n\u3000\u3000Harry accelerated, eyes fixed on the speck of gold ahead -- but just then, Cho appeared out of thin air, blocking him --\n\u3000\u3000\"HARRY, THIS IS NO TIME TO BE A GENTLEMAN!\" Wood roared as Harry swerved to avoid a collision. \"KNOCK HER OFF HER BROOM IF YOU HAVE TO!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry turned and caught sight of Cho; she was grinning. The Snitch had vanished again. Harry turned his Firebolt upward and was soon twenty feet above the game. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Cho following him.... She'd decided to mark him rather than search for the Snitch herself... All right, then... if she wanted to tail him, she'd have to take the consequences....\n\u3000\u3000He dived again, and Cho, thinking he'd seen the Snitch, tried to follow; Harry pulled out of the dive very sharply; she hurtled downward; he rose fast as a bullet once more, and then saw it, for the third time -- the Snitch was glittering way above the field at the Ravenclaw end.\n\u3000\u3000He accelerated; so, many feet below, did Cho. He was winning, gaining on the Snitch with every second -- then --\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh!\" screamed Cho, pointing.\n\u3000\u3000Distracted, Harry looked down.\n\u3000\u3000Three dementors, three tall, black, hooded dementors, were looking up at him.\n\u3000\u3000He didn't stop to think. Plunging a hand down the neck of his robes, he whipped out his wand and roared, \"Expecto patronum!\"\n\u3000\u3000Something silver-white, something enormous, erupted from the end of his wand. He knew it had shot directly at the dementors but didn't pause to watch; his mind still miraculously clear, he looked ahead -- he was nearly there. He stretched out the hand still grasping his wand and just managed to close his fingers over the small, struggling Snitch.\n\u3000\u3000Madam Hooch's whistle sounded. Harry turned around in midair and saw six scarlet blurs bearing down on him; next moment, the whole team was hugging him so hard he was nearly pulled off his broom. Down below he could hear the roars of the Gryffindors in the crowd.\n\u3000\u3000\"That's my boy!\" Wood kept yelling. Alicia, Angelina, and Katie had all kissed Harry; Fred had him in a grip so tight Harry felt as though his head would come off In complete disarray, the team managed to make its way back to the ground. Harry got off his broom and looked up to see a gaggle of Gryffindor supporters sprinting onto the field, Ron in the lead. Before he knew it, he had been engulfed by the cheering crowd.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes!\" Ron yelled, yanking Harry's arm into the air. \"Yes! Yes!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well done, Harry!\" said Percy, looking delighted. \"Ten Galleons to me! Must find Penelope, excuse me --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Good for you, Harry!\" roared Seamus Finnigan.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ruddy brilliant!\" boomed Hagrid over the heads of the milling Gryffindors.\n\u3000\u3000\"That was quite some Patronus,\" said a voice in Harry's ear.\n\u3000\u3000Harry turned around to see Professor Lupin, who looked both shaken and pleased.\n\u3000\u3000\"The dementors didn't affect me at all!\" Harry said excitedly. \"I didn't feel a thing!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That would be because they -- er -- weren't dementors,\" said Professor Lupin. \"Come and see -- \"\n\u3000\u3000He led Harry out of the crowd until they were able to see the edge of the field.\n\u3000\u3000\"You gave Mr. Malfoy quite a fright,\" said Lupin.\n\u3000\u3000Harry stared. Lying in a crumpled heap on the ground were Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, and Marcus Flint, the Slytherin team Captain, all struggling to remove themselves from long, black, hooded robes. It looked as though Malfoy had been standing on Goyle's shoulders. Standing over them, with an expression of the utmost fury on her face, was Professor McGonagall.\n\u3000\u3000\"An unworthy trick!\" she was shouting. \"A low and cowardly attempt to sabotage the Gryffindor Seeker! Detention for all of you, and fifty points from Slytherin! I shall be speaking to Professor Dumbledore about this, make no mistake! Ah, here he comes now!\"\n\u3000\u3000If anything could have set the seal on Gryffindor's victory, it was this. Ron, who had fought his way through to Harry's side, doubled up with laughter as they watched Malfoy fighting to extricate himself from the robe, Goyle's head still stuck inside it.\n\u3000\u3000\"Come on, Harry!\" said George, fighting his way over. \"Party! Gryffindor common room, now!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Right,\" said Harry, and feeling happier than he had in ages, he and the rest of the team led the way, still in their scarlet robes, out of the stadium and back up to the castle.\n\u3000\u3000It felt as though they had already won the Quidditch Cup; the party went on all day and well into the night. Fred and George Weasley disappeared for a couple of hours and returned with armfuls of bottles of butterbeer, pumpkin fizz, and several bags full of Honeydukes sweets.\n\u3000\u3000\"How did you do that?\" squealed Angelina Johnson as George started throwing Peppermint Toads into the crowd.\n\u3000\u3000\"With a little help from Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs,\" Fred muttered in Harry's ear.\n\u3000\u3000Only one person wasn't joining in the festivities. Hermione, incredibly, was sitting in a corner, attempting to read an enormous book entitled Home Life and Social Habits of British Muggles. Harry broke away from the table where Fred and George had started juggling butterbeer bottles and went over to her.\n\u3000\u3000\"Did you even come to the match?\" he asked her.\n\u3000\u3000\"Of course I did,\" said Hermione in a strangely high-pitched voice, not looking up. \"And I'm very glad we won, and I think you did really well, but I need to read this by Monday.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Come on, Hermione, come and have some food,\" Harry said, looking over at Ron and wondering whether he was in a good enough mood to bury the hatchet.\n\u3000\u3000\"I can't, Harry. I've still got four hundred and twenty-two pages to read!\" said Hermione, now sounding slightly hysterical. \"Anyway...\" She glanced over at Ron too. \"He doesn't want me to join in.\"\n\u3000\u3000There was no arguing with this, as Ron chose that moment to say loudly, \"If Scabbers hadn't just been eaten, he could have had some of those Fudge Flies. He used to really like them --\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione burst into tears. Before Harry could say or do anything, she tucked the enormous book under her arm, and, still sobbing, ran toward the staircase to the girls' dormitories and out of sight.\n\u3000\u3000\"Can't you give her a break?\" Harry asked Ron quietly.\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Ron flatly. \"If she just acted like she was sorry -- but she'll never admit she's wrong, Hermione. She's still acting like Scabbers has gone on vacation or something.\"\n\u3000\u3000The Gryffindor party ended only when Professor McGonagall turned up in her tartan dressing gown and hair net at one in the morning, to insist that they all go to bed. Harry and Ron climbed the stairs to their dormitory, still discussing the match. At last, exhausted, Harry climbed into bed, twitched the hangings of his four-poster shut to block out a ray of moonlight, lay back, and felt himself almost instantly drifting off to sleep....\n\u3000\u3000He had a very strange dream. He was walking through a forest, his Firebolt over his shoulder, following something silvery-white. It was winding its way through the trees ahead, and he could only catch glimpses of it between the leaves. Anxious to catch up with it, he sped up, but as he moved faster, so did his quarry. Harry broke into a run, and ahead he heard hooves gathering speed. Now he was running flat out, and ahead he could hear galloping. Then he turned a corner into a clearing and -\n\u3000\u3000\"AAARRGGHH! NOOO!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry woke as suddenly as though he'd been hit in the face. Disoriented in the total darkness, he fumbled with his hangings, he could hear movements around him, and Seamus Finnigan's voice from the other side of the room: \"What's going on?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry thought he heard the dormitory door slam. At last finding the divide in his curtains, he ripped them back, and at the same moment, Dean Thomas lit his lamp.\n\u3000\u3000Ron was sitting up in bed, the hangings torn from one side, a look of utmost terror on his face.\n\u3000\u3000\"Black! Sirius Black! With a knife!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Here! Just now! Slashed the curtains! Woke me up!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You sure you weren't dreaming, Ron?\" said Dean.\n\u3000\u3000\"Look at the curtains! I tell you, he was here!\"\n\u3000\u3000They all scrambled out of bed; Harry reached the dormitory door first, and they sprinted back down the staircase. Doors opened behind them, and sleepy voices called after them.\n\u3000\u3000\"Who shouted?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What're you doing?\"\n\u3000\u3000The common room was lit with the glow of the dying fire, still littered with the debris from the party. It was deserted.\n\u3000\u3000\"Are you sure you weren't dreaming, Ron?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm telling you, I saw him!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What's all the noise?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor McGonagall told us to go to bed!\"\n\u3000\u3000A few of the girls had come down their staircase, pulling or, dressing gowns and yawning. Boys, too, were reappearing.\n\u3000\u3000\"Excellent, are we carrying on?\" said Fred Weasley brightly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Everyone back upstairs!\" said Percy, hurrying into the common room and pinning his Head Boy badge to his pajamas as he spoke.\n\u3000\u3000\"Perce -- Sirius Black!\" said Ron faintly. \"In our dormitory! With a knife! Woke me up!\"\n\u3000\u3000The common room went very still.\n\u3000\u3000\"Nonsense!\" said Percy, looking startled. \"You had too much to eat, Ron -- had a nightmare --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm telling you --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Now, really, enough's enough!\"\n\u3000\u3000Professor McGonagall was back. She slammed the portrait behind her as she entered the common room and stared furiously around.\n\u3000\u3000\"I am delighted that Gryffindor won the match, but this is getting ridiculous! Percy, I expected better of you!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I certainly didn't authorize this, Professor!\" said Percy, puffing himself up indignantly. \"I was just telling them all to get back to bed! My brother Ron here had a nightmare --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"IT WASN'T A NIGHTMARE!\" Ron yelled. \"PROFESSOR, I WOKE UP, AND SIRIUS BLACK WAS STANDING OVER ME, HOLDING A KNIFE!\"\n\u3000\u3000Professor McGonagall stared at him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't be ridiculous, Weasley, how could he possibly have gotten through the portrait hole?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ask him!\" said Ron, pointing a shaking finger at the back of Sir Cadogan's picture. \"Ask him if he saw --\"\n\u3000\u3000Glaring suspiciously at Ron, Professor McGonagall pushed the Portrait back open and went outside. The whole common room listened with bated breath. \"Sir Cadogan, did you just let a man enter Gryffindor Tower?\" \"Certainly, good lady!\" cried Sir Cadogan.\n\u3000\u3000There was a stunned silence, both inside and outside the common room.\n\u3000\u3000\"You -- you did?\" said Professor McGonagall. \"But -- but the password!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He had 'em!\" said Sir Cadogan proudly. \"Had the whole week's, my lady! Read 'em off a little piece of paper!\"\n\u3000\u3000Professor McGonagall pulled herself back through the portrait hole to face the stunned crowd. She was white as chalk.\n\u3000\u3000\"Which person,\" she said, her voice shaking, \"which abysmally foolish person wrote down this week's passwords and left them lying around?\"\n\u3000\u3000There was utter silence, broken by the smallest of terrified squeaks. Neville Longbottom, trembling from head to fluffy slippered toes, raised his hand slowly into the air.\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER FOURTEEN\n\u3000\u3000SNAPE'S GRUDGE\n\u3000\u3000No one in Gryffindor Tower slept that night. They knew that the castle was being searched again, and the whole House stayed awake in the common room, waiting to hear whether Black had been caught. Professor McGonagall came back at dawn, to tell them that he had again escaped.\n\u3000\u3000Throughout the day, everywhere they went they saw signs of tighter security; Professor Flitwick could be seen teaching the front doors to recognize a large picture of Sirius Black; Filch was suddenly bustling up and down the corridors, boarding up everything from tiny cracks in the walls to mouse holes. Sir Cadogan had been fired. His portrait had been taken back to its lonely landing on the seventh floor, and the Fat Lady was back. She had been expertly restored, but was still extremely nervous, and had agreed to return to her job only on condition that she was given extra protection. A bunch of surly security trolls had been hired to guard her. They paced the corridor in a menacing group, talking in grunts and comparing the size of their clubs.\n\u3000\u3000Harry couldn't help noticing that the statue of the one-eyed witch on the third floor remained unguarded and unblocked. It seemed that Fred and George had been right in thinking that they -- and now Harry, Ron, and Hermione -- were the only ones who knew about the hidden passageway within it.\n\u3000\u3000\"D'you reckon we should tell someone?\" Harry asked Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"We know he's not coming in through Honeyduke's,\" said Ron dismissively. \"We'd've heard if the shop had been broken into.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry was glad Ron took this view. If the one-eyed witch was boarded up too, he would never be able to go into Hogsmeade again.\n\u3000\u3000Ron had become an instant celebrity. For the first time in his life, people were paying more attention to him than to Harry, and it was clear that Ron was rather enjoying the experience. Though still severely shaken by the night's events, he was happy to tell anyone who asked what had happened, with a wealth of detail.\n\u3000\u3000\"... I was asleep, and I heard this ripping noise, and I thought it was in my dream, you know? But then there was this draft... I woke up and one side of the hangings on my bed had been pulled down.... I rolled over... and I saw him standing over me... like a skeleton, with loads of filthy hair ... holding this great long knife, must've been twelve inches... and he looked at me, and I looked at him, and then I yelled, and he scampered.\n\u3000\u3000\"Why, though?\" Ron added to Harry as the group of secondyear girls who had been listening to his chilling tale departed. \"Why did he run?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry had been wondering the same thing. Why had Black, having got the wrong bed, not silenced Ron and proceeded to Harry? Black had proved twelve years ago that he didn't mind murdering innocent people, and this time he had been facing five unarmed boys, four of whom were asleep.\n\u3000\u3000\"He must've known he'd have a job getting back out of the castle once you'd yelled and woken people up,\" said Harry thoughtfully. \"He'd've had to kill the whole House to get back through the portrait hole... then he would' ve met the teachers....\"\n\u3000\u3000Neville was in total disgrace. Professor McGonagall was so furious with him she had banned him from all future Hogsmeade visits, given him a detention, and forbidden anyone to give him the password into the tower. Poor Neville was forced to wait. outside the common room every night for somebody to let him in, while the security trolls leered unpleasantly at him. None of these punishments, however, came close to matching the one his grandmother had in store for him. Two days after Black's break-in, she sent Neville the very worst thing a Hogwarts student could receive over breakfast -- a Howler.\n\u3000\u3000The school owls swooped into the Great Hall carrying the mail as usual, and Neville choked as a huge barn owl landed in front of him, a scarlet envelope clutched in its beak. Harry and Ron, who were sitting opposite him, recognized the letter as a Howler at once -- Ron had got one from his mother the year before.\n\u3000\u3000\"Run for it, Neville,\" Ron advised.\n\u3000\u3000Neville didn't need telling twice. He seized the envelope, and holding it before him like a bomb, sprinted out of the hall, while the Slytherin table exploded with laughter at the sight of him. They heard the Howler go off in the entrance hall -- Neville's grandmother's voice, magically magnified to a hundred times its Usual volume, shrieking about how he had brought shame on the whole family.\n\u3000\u3000Harry was too busy feeling sorry for Neville to notice immediately that he had a letter too. Hedwig got his attention by nipping him sharply on the wrist.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ouch! Oh -- thanks, Hedwig.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry tore open the envelope while Hedwig helped herself to some of Neville's cornflakes. The note inside said:\n\u3000\u3000Dear Harry and Ron, How Abut having tea with me this afternoon 'round six? I'll come collect you from the castle. WAIT FOR ME IN THE ENTRANCE HALL; YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED OUT ON YOUR OWN. Cheers, Hagrid\n\u3000\u3000\"He probably wants to hear all about Black!\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000So at six o'clock that afternoon, Harry and Ron left Gryffindor Tower, passed the security trolls at a run, and headed down to the entrance hall.\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid was already waiting for them.\n\u3000\u3000\"All right, Hagrid!\" said Ron. \"S'pose you want to hear about Saturday night, do you?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I've already heard all abou' it,\" said Hagrid, opening the front doors and leading them outside.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh,\" said Ron, looking slightly put out.\n\u3000\u3000The first thing they saw on entering Hagrid's cabin was Buckbeak, who was stretched out on top of Hagrid's patchwork quilt, his enormous wings folded tight to his body, enjoying a large plate of dead ferrets. Averting his eyes from this unpleasant sight, Harry saw a gigantic, hairy brown suit and a very horrible yellow-and-orange tie hanging from the top of Hagrid's wardrobe door.\n\u3000\u3000\"What are they for, Hagrid?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Buckbeaks case against the Committee fer the Disposal o' Dangerous Creatures,\" said Hagrid. \"This Friday. Him an' me'll be goin' down ter London together. I've booked two beds on the Knight Bus....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry felt a nasty pang of guilt. He had completely forgotten that Buckbeak's trial was so near, and judging by the uneasy look on Ron's face, he had too. They had also forgotten their promise about helping him prepare Buckbeak's defense; the arrival of the Firebolt had driven it clean out of their minds.\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid poured them tea and offered them a plate of Bath buns but they knew better than to accept; they had had too much experience with Hagrid's cooking.\n\u3000\u3000I got somethin' ter discuss with you two,\" said Hagrid, sitting himself between them and looking uncharacteristically serious.\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione,\" said Hagrid.\n\u3000\u3000\"What about her?\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"She's in a righ' state, that's what. She's bin comin' down ter visit me a lot since Chris'mas. Bin feelin' lonely. Firs' yeh weren' talking to her because o' the Firebolt, now yer not talkin' to her because her cat --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"-- ate Scabbers!\" Ron interjected angrily.\n\u3000\u3000\"Because her cat acted like all cats do,\" Hagrid continued doggedly. \"She's cried a fair few times, yeh know. Goin' through a rough time at the moment. Bitten off more'n she can chew, if yeh ask me, all the work she's tryin' ter do. Still found time ter help me with Buckbeak's case, mind.... She's found some really good stuff fer me... reckon he'll stand a good chance now...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hagrid, we should've helped as well -- sorry --\" Harry began awkwardly.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm not blamin' yeh!\" said Hagrid, waving Harry's apology aside. \"Gawd knows yeh've had enough ter be gettin' on with. I've seen yeh practicin' Quidditch ev'ry hour o' the day an' night -- but I gotta tell yeh, I thought you two'd value yer friend more'n broomsticks or rats. Tha's all.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron exchanged uncomfortable looks.\n\u3000\u3000\"Really upset, she was, when Black nearly stabbed yeh, Ron. She's got her heart in the right place, Hermione has, an' you two not talkin' to her --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"If she'd just get rid of that cat, I'd speak to her again!\" Ron said angrily. \"But she's still sticking up for it! It's a maniac, and she won't hear a word against it!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah, well, people can be a bit stupid abou' their pets,\" said Hagrid wisely. Behind him, Buckbeak spat a few ferret bones onto Hagrid's pillow.\n\u3000\u3000They spent the rest of their visit discussing Gryffindor's improved chances for the Quidditch Cup. At nine o'clock, Hagrid walked them back up to the castle.\n\u3000\u3000A large group of people was bunched around the bulletin board when they returned to the common room.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hogsmeade, next weekend!\" said Ron, craning over the heads to read the new notice. \"What d'you reckon?\" he added quietly to Harry as they went to sit down.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, Filch hasn't done anything about the passage into Honeydukes....\" Harry said, even more quietly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry!\" said a voice in his right ear. Harry started and looked around at Hermione, who was sitting at the table right behind them and clearing a space in the wall of books that had been hiding her.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, if you go into Hogsmeade again... I'll tell Professor McGonagall about that map!\" said Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"Can you hear someone talking, Harry?\" growled Ron, not looking at Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron, how can you let him go with you? After what Sirius Black nearly did to you! I mean it, I'll tell --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"So now you're trying to get Harry expelled!\" said Ron furiously. \"Haven't you done enough damage this year?\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione opened her mouth to respond, but with a soft hiss, Crookshanks leapt onto her lap. Hermione took one frightened look at the expression on Ron's face, gathered up Crookshanks, and hurried away toward the girls' dormitories.\n\u3000\u3000\"So how about it?\" Ron said to Harry as though there had been no interruption. \"Come on, last time we went you didn't see anything. You haven't even been inside Zonko's yet!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked around to check that Hermione was well out of earshot.\n\u3000\u3000\"Okay,\" he said. \"But I'm taking the Invisibility Cloak this time.\"\n\u3000\u3000On Saturday morning, Harry packed his Invisibility Cloak in his bag, slipped the Marauder's Map into his pocket, and went down to breakfast with everyone else. Hermione kept shooting suspicious looks down the table at him, but he avoided her eye and was careful to let her see him walking back up the marble staircase in the entrance hall as everybody else proceeded to the front doors.\n\u3000\u3000\"'Bye!\" Harry called to Ron. \"See you when you get back!\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron grinned and winked.\n\u3000\u3000Harry hurried up to the third floor, slipping the Marauder's Map out of his pocket as he went. Crouching behind the one-eyed witch, he smoothed it out. A tiny dot was moving in his direction. Harry squinted at it. The minuscule writing next to it read Neville Longbottom.\n\u3000\u3000Harry quickly pulled out his wand, muttered, \"Dissendium!\" and shoved his bag into the statue, but before he could climb in himself, Neville came around the corner.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry! I forgot you weren't going to Hogsmeade either!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hi, Neville,\" said Harry, moving swiftly away from the statue and pushing the map back into his pocket. \"What are you up to?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Nothing,\" shrugged Neville. \"Want a game of Exploding Snap?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Er -- not now -- I was going to go to the library and do that vampire essay for Lupin --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll come with you!\" said Neville brightly. I haven't done it either!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Er -- hang on -- yeah, I forgot, I finished it last night!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Great, you can help me!\" said Neville, his round face anxious. \"I don't understand that thing about the garlic at all -- do they have to eat it, or --\"\n\u3000\u3000He broke off with a small gasp, looking over Harry's shoulder.\n\u3000\u3000It was Snape. Neville took a quick step behind Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"And what are you two doing here?\" said Snape, coming to a halt and looking from one to the other. \"An odd place to meet --\"\n\u3000\u3000To Harry's immense disquiet, Snape's black eyes flicked to the doorways on either side of them, and then to the one-eyed witch.\n\u3000\u3000\"We're not -- meeting here,\" said Harry. \"We just -- met here.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Indeed?\" said Snape. \"You have a habit of turning up in unexpected places, Potter, and you are very rarely there for no good reason.... I suggest the pair of you return to Gryffindor Tower, where you belong.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Neville set off without another word. As they turned the corner, Harry looked back. Snape was running one of his hands over the one-eyed witch's head, examining it closely.\n\u3000\u3000Harry managed to shake Neville off at the Fat Lady by telling him the password, then pretending he'd left his vampire essay in the library and doubling back. Once out of sight of the security trolls, he pulled out the map again and held it close to his nose.\n\u3000\u3000The third floor corridor seemed to be deserted. Harry scanned the map carefully and saw, with a leap of relief, that the tiny dot labeled Severus Snape was now back in its office.\n\u3000\u3000He sprinted back to the one-eyed witch, opened her hump, heaved himself inside, and slid down to meet his bag at the bottom of the stone chute. He wiped the Marauder's Map blank again, then set off at a run.\n\u3000\u3000Harry, completely hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, emerged into the sunlight outside Honeydukes and prodded Ron in the back.\n\u3000\u3000It's me,\" he muttered.\n\u3000\u3000\"What kept you?\" Ron hissed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Snape was hanging around.\"\n\u3000\u3000They set off up the High Street.\n\u3000\u3000\"Where are you?\" Ron kept muttering out of the corner of his mouth. \"Are you still there? This feels weird....\"\n\u3000\u3000They went to the post office; Ron pretended to be checking the price of an owl to Bill in Egypt so that Harry could have a good look around. The owls sat hooting softly down at him, at least three hundred of them; from Great Grays right down to tiny little Scops owls (\"Local Deliveries Only\"), which were so small they could have sat in the palm of Harry's hand.\n\u3000\u3000Then they visited Zonko's, which was so packed with students Harry had to exercise great care not to tread on anyone and cause a panic. There were jokes and tricks to fulfill even Fred's and George's wildest dreams; Harry gave Ron whispered orders and passed him some gold from under the cloak. They left Zonko's with their money bags considerably lighter than they had been on entering, but their pockets bulging with Dungbombs, Hiccup Sweets, Frog Spawn Soap, and a Nose-Biting Teacup apiece.\n\u3000\u3000The day was fine and breezy, and neither of them felt like staying indoors, so they walked past the Three Broomsticks and climbed a slope to visit the Shrieking Shack, the most haunted dwelling in Britain. It stood a little way above the rest of the village, and even in daylight was slightly creepy, with its boarded windows and dank overgrown garden.\n\u3000\u3000\"Even the Hogwarts ghosts avoid it,\" said Ron as they leaned on the fence, looking up at it. \"I asked Nearly Headless Nick... he says he's heard a very rough crowd lives here. No one can get in. Fred and George tried, obviously, but all the entrances are sealed shut....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry, feeling hot from their climb, was just considering taking off the cloak for a few minutes when they heard voices nearby. Someone was climbing toward the house from the other side of the hill; moments later, Malfoy had appeared, followed closely by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy was speaking.\n\u3000\u3000\"... should have an owl from Father any time now. He had to go to the hearing to tell them about my arm... about how I couldn't use it for three months....\"\n\u3000\u3000Crabbe and Goyle sniggered.\n\u3000\u3000\"I really wish I could hear that great hairy moron trying to defend himself... 'There's no 'arm in 'im, 'onest that hippogriff's as good as dead --\"\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy suddenly caught sight of Ron. His pale face split in a malevolent grin.\n\u3000\u3000\"What are you doing, Weasley?\"\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy looked up at the crumbling house behind Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Suppose You'd love to live here, wouldn't you, Weasley? Dreaming about having your own bedroom? I heard your family all sleep in one room -- is that true?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry seized the back of Ron's robes to stop him from leaping on Malfoy. \"Leave him to me,\" he hissed in Ron's ear.\n\u3000\u3000The opportunity was too perfect to miss. Harry crept silently around behind Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, bent down, and scooped a large handful of mud out of the path.\n\u3000\u3000\"We were just discussing your friend Hagrid,\" Malfoy said to Ron. \"Just trying to imagine what he's saying to the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures. D'you think he'll cry when they cut off his hippogriff's\n\u3000\u3000SPLAT.\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy's head jerked forward as the mud hit him; his silverblond hair was suddenly dripping in muck.\n\u3000\u3000\"What the --?\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron had to hold onto the fence to keep himself standing, he was laughing so hard. Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle spun stupidly on the spot, staring wildly around, Malfoy trying to wipe his hair clean.\n\u3000\u3000\"What was that? 'Who did that?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Very haunted up here, isn't it?\" said Ron, with the air of one commenting on the weather.\n\u3000\u3000Crabbe and Goyle were looking scared. Their bulging muscles were no use against ghosts. Malfoy was staring madly around at the deserted landscape.\n\u3000\u3000Harry sneaked along the path, where a particularly sloppy puddle yielded some foul-smelling, green sludge.\n\u3000\u3000SPLATTER.\n\u3000\u3000Crabbe and Goyle caught some this time. Goyle hopped furiously on the spot, trying to rub it out of his small, dull eyes.\n\u3000\u3000\"It came from over there!\" said Malfoy, wiping his face, and staring at a spot some six feet to the left of Harry.\n\u3000\u3000Crabbe blundered forward, his long arms outstretched like a zombie. Harry dodged around him, picked up a stick, and lobbed it at Crabbe's back. Harry doubled up with silent laughter as Crabbe did a kind of pirouette in midair, trying to see who had thrown it. As Ron was the only person Crabbe could see, it was Ron he started toward, but Harry stuck out his leg. Crabbe stumbled -- and his huge, flat foot caught the hem of Harry's cloak. Harry felt a great tug, then the cloak slid off his face.\n\u3000\u3000For a split second, Malfoy stared at him.\n\u3000\u3000\"AAARGH!\" he yelled, pointing at Harry's head. Then he turned tail and ran, at breakneck speed, back down the hill, Crabbe and Goyle behind him.\n\u3000\u3000Harry tugged the cloak up again, but the damage was done.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry!\" Ron said, stumbling forward and staring hopelessly at the point where Harry had disappeared, \"you'd better run for it! If Malfoy tells anyone -- you'd better get back to the castle, quick --\" \"See you later,\" said Harry, and without another word, he tore back down the path toward Hogsmeade.\n\u3000\u3000Would Malfoy believe what he had seen? Would anyone believe\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy? Nobody knew about the Invisibility Cloak -- nobody except Dumbledore. Harry's stomach turned over -- Dumbledore would know exactly what had happened, if Malfoy said any- thing --\n\u3000\u3000Back into Honeydukes, back down the cellar steps, across the stone floor, through the trapdoor -- Harry pulled off the cloak, tucked it under his arm, and ran, flat out, along the passage.... Malfoy would get back first... how long would it take him to find a teacher? Panting, a sharp pain in his side, Harry didn't slow down until he reached the stone slide. He would have to leave the cloak where it was, it was too much of a giveaway in case Malfoy had tipped off a teacher -- he hid it in a shadowy corner, then started to climb, fast as he could, his sweaty hands slipping on the sides of the chute. He reached the inside of the witch's hump, tapped it with his wand, stuck his head through, and hoisted himself out; the hump closed, and just as Harry jumped out from behind the statue, he heard quick footsteps approaching.\n\u3000\u3000It was Snape. He approached Harry at a swift walk, his black robes swishing, then stopped in front of him.\n\u3000\u3000\"So,\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000There was a look of surpressed triumph about him. Harry tried to look innocent, all too aware of his sweaty face and his muddy hands, which he quickly hid in his pockets.\n\u3000\u3000\"Come with me, Potter,\" said Snape.\n\u3000\u3000Harry followed him downstairs, trying to wipe his hands clean on the inside of his robes without Snape noticing. They walked down the stairs to the dungeons and then into Snape's office.\n\u3000\u3000Harry had been in here only once before, and he had been in very serious trouble then too. Snape had aquired a few more slimy horrible things in jars since last time, all standing on shelves behind his desk, glinting in the firelight and adding to the threatening atmosphere.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sit,\" said Snape.\n\u3000\u3000Harry sat. Snape, however, remained, standing.\n\u3000\u3000\"Mr. Malfoy has just been to see me with a strange story, Potter,\" said Snape.\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't say anything.\n\u3000\u3000\"He tells me that he was up by the Shrieking Shack when he ran into Weasley -- apparently alone.\"\n\u3000\u3000Still, Harry didn't speak.\n\u3000\u3000\"Mr. Malfoy states that he was standing talking to Weasley, when a large amount of mud hit him in the back of the head. How do you think that could have happened?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry tried to look mildly surprised.\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't know, Professor.\"\n\u3000\u3000Snape's eyes were boring into Harry's. It was exactly like trying to stare down a hippogriff. Harry tried hard not to blink.\n\u3000\u3000\"Mr. Malfoy then saw an extraordinary apparition. Can you imagine what it might have been, Potter?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Harry, now trying to sound innocently curious.\n\u3000\u3000\"It was your head, Potter. Floating in midair.\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a long silence.\n\u3000\u3000\"Maybe he'd better go to Madam Pomfrey,\" said Harry. \"If he's seeing things like --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What would your head have been doing in Hogsmeade, Potter?\" said Snape softly. \"Your head is not allowed in Hogsmeade. No part of your body has permission to be in Hogsmeade.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I know that,\" said Harry, striving to keep his face free of guilt or fear. \"It sounds like Malfoy's having hallucin --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Malfoy is not having hallucinations,\" snarled Snape, and he bent down, a hand on each arm of Harry's chair, so that their faces were a foot apart. \"If your head was in Hogsmeade, so was the rest of you.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I've been up in Gryffindor Tower,\" said Harry. \"Like you told --\" \"Can anyone confirm that?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't say anything. Snape's thin mouth curled into a horrible smile.\n\u3000\u3000\"So,\" he said, straightening up again. \"Everyone from the Minister of Magic downward has been trying to keep famous Harry Potter safe from Sirius Black. But famous Harry Potter is a law unto himself Let the ordinary people worry about his safety! Famous Harry Potter goes where he wants to, with no thought for the consequences.\n\u3000\u3000Harry stayed silent. Snape was trying to provoke him into telling the truth. He wasn't going to do it. Snape had no proof -- yet.\n\u3000\u3000\"How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter,\" Snape said suddenly, his eyes glinting. \"He too was exceedingly arrogant. A small amount of talent on the Quidditch field made him think he was a cut above the rest of us too. Strutting around the place with his friends and admirers... The resemblance between you is uncanny.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"My dad didn't strut,\" said Harry, before he could stop himself. \"And neither do I.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Your father didn't set much store by rules either,\" Snape went on, pressing his advantage, his thin face full of malice. \"Rules were for lesser mortals, not Quidditch Cup-winners. His head was so swollen --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"SHUT UP!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry was suddenly on his feet. Rage such as he had not felt since his last night in Privet Drive was coursing through him. He didn't care that Snape's face had gone rigid, the black eyes flashing dangerously.\n\u3000\u3000\"What did you say to me, Potter?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I told you to shut up about my dad!\" Harry yelled. I know the truth, all right? He saved your life! Dumbledore told me! You wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for my dad!\"\n\u3000\u3000Snape's sallow skin had gone the color of sour milk.\n\u3000\u3000\"And did the headmaster tell you the circumstances in which your father saved my life?\" he whispered. \"Or did he consider the details too unpleasant for precious Potter's delicate ears?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry bit his lip. He didn't know what had happened and didn't want to admit it -- but Snape seemed to have guessed the truth.\n\u3000\u3000I would hate for you to run away with a false idea of your father, Potter,\" he said, a terrible grin twisting his face. \"Have you been imagining some act of glorious heroism? Then let me correct you -- your saintly father and his friends played a highly amusing joke on me that would have resulted in my death if your father hadn't got cold feet at the last moment. There was nothing brave about what he did. He was saving his own skin as much as mine. Had their joke succeeded, he would have been expelled from Hogwarts.\"\n\u3000\u3000Snape's uneven, yellowish teeth were bared.\n\u3000\u3000\"Turn out your pockets, Potter!\" he spat suddenly.\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't move. There was a pounding in his ears.\n\u3000\u3000\"Turn out your pockets, or we go straight to the headmaster! Pull them out, Potter!\"\n\u3000\u3000Cold with dread, Harry slowly pulled out the bag of Zonko's tricks and the Marauder's Map.\n\u3000\u3000Snap picked up the Zonko's bag.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron gave them to me,\" said Harry, praying he'd get a chance to tip Ron off before Snape saw him. \"He -brought them back from Hogsmeade last time --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Indeed? And you've been carrying them around ever since? How very touching... and what is this?\"\n\u3000\u3000Snape had picked up the map. Harry tried with all his might to keep his face impassive.\n\u3000\u3000\"Spare bit of parchment,\" he said with a shrug.\n\u3000\u3000Snape turned it over, his eyes on Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Surely you don't need such a very old piece of parchment?\" he said. \"Why don't I just -- throw this away?\"\n\u3000\u3000His hand moved toward the fire.\n\u3000\u3000\"No!\" Harry said quickly.\n\u3000\u3000\"So!\" said Snape, his long nostrils quivering. \"Is this another treasured gift from Mr. Weasley? Or is it -- something else? A letter, perhaps, written in invisible ink? Or -- instructions to get into Hogsmeade without passing the dementors?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry blinked. Snape's eyes gleamed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Let me see, let me see....\" he muttered, taking out his wand and smoothing the map out on his desk. \"Reveal your secret!\" he said, touching the wand to the parchment.\n\u3000\u3000Nothing happened. Harry clenched his hands to stop them from shaking.\n\u3000\u3000\"Show yourself!\" Snape said, tapping the map sharply.\n\u3000\u3000It stayed blank. Harry was taking deep, calming breaths.\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor Severus Snape, master of this school, commands you to yield the information you conceal!\" Snape said, hitting the map with his wand.\n\u3000\u3000As though an invisible hand were writing upon it, words appeared on the smooth surface of the map.\n\u3000\u3000Mooney presents his compliments to Professor Snape, and begs him to keep his abnormally large nose out of other people's business.\"\n\u3000\u3000Snape froze. Harry stared, dumbstruck, at the message. But the map didn't stop there. More writing was appearing beneath the first.\n\u3000\u3000\"Mr. Prongs agrees with Mr. Moony and would like to add that Professor Snape is an ugle git.\"\n\u3000\u3000It would have been very funny if the situation hadn't been so serious. And there was more....\n\u3000\u3000\"Mr. Padfoot would like to register his astonishment that an idiot like that ever became a professor.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry closed his eyes in horror. When he'd opened them, the map had had its last word.\n\u3000\u3000\"Mr. Wormtail bids Professor Snape good day, and advises him to wash his hair , the slimeball.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry waited for the blow to fall.\n\u3000\u3000\"So...\" said Snape softly. \"We'll see about this....\"\n\u3000\u3000He strode across to his fire, seized a fistful of glittering powder from a jar on the fireplace, and threw it into the flames.\n\u3000\u3000\"Lupin!\" Snape called into the fire. \"I want a word!\"\n\u3000\u3000Utterly bewildered, Harry stared at the fire. A large shape had appeared in it, revolving very fast. Seconds later, Professor Lupin was clambering out of the fireplace, brushing ash off his shabby robes.\n\u3000\u3000\"You called, Severus?\" said Lupin mildly.\n\u3000\u3000\"I certainly did,\" said Snape, his face contorted with fury as he strode back to his desk. \"I have just asked Potter to empty his pockets. He was carrying this.\"\n\u3000\u3000Snape pointed at the parchment, on which the words of Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs were still shining. An odd, closed expression appeared on Lupin's face.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well?\" said Snape.\n\u3000\u3000Lupin continued to stare at the map. Harry had the impression that Lupin was doing some very quick thinking.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well?\" said Snape again. \"This parchment is plainly full of Dark Magic. This is supposed to be your area of expertise, Lupin. Where do you imagine Potter got such a thing?\"\n\u3000\u3000Lupin looked up and, by the merest half-glance in Harry's direction, warned him not to interrupt.\n\u3000\u3000\"Full of Dark Magic?\" he repeated mildly. \"Do you really think so, Severus? It looks to me as though it is merely a piece of parchment that insults anybody who reads it. Childish, but surely not dangerous? I imagine Harry got it from a joke shop --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Indeed?\" said Snape. His jaw had gone rigid with anger. \"You think a joke shop could supply him with such a thing? You don't think it more likely that he got it directly from the manufacturers?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't understand what Snape was talking about. Nor, apparently, did Lupin.\n\u3000\u3000\"You mean, by Mr. Wormtail or one of these people?\" he said. \"Harry, do you know any of these men?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Harry quickly.\n\u3000\u3000\"You see, Severus?\" said Lupin, turning back to Snape. \"It looks like a Zonko product to me --\"\n\u3000\u3000Right on cue, Ron came bursting into the office. He was completely out of breath, and stopped just short of Snape's desk, clutching the stitch in his chest and trying to speak.\n\u3000\u3000\"I -- gave -- Harry -- that -- stuff,\" he choked. \"Bought -- it... in Zonko's... ages -- ago...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well!\" said Lupin, clapping his hands together and looking around cheerfully. \"That seems to clear that up! Severus, I'll take this back, shall I?\" He folded the map and tucked it inside his robes. \"Harry, Ron, come with me, I need a word about my vampire essay -- excuse us, Severus --\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't dare look at Snape as they left his office. He. Ron, and Lupin walked all the way back into the entrance hall before speaking. Then Harry turned to Lupin.\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor, I --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't want to hear explanations,\" said Lupin shortly. He glanced around the empty entrance hall and lowered his voice. \"I happen to know that this map was confiscated by Mr. Filch many years ago. Yes, I know it' s a map,\" he said as Harry and Ron looked amazed. \"I don't want to know how it fell into your possession. I am, however, astounded that you didn't hand it in. Particularly after what happened the last time a student left information about the castle lying around. And I can't let you have it back, Harry.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry had expected that, and was too keen for explanations to protest.\n\u3000\u3000\"Why did Snape think I'd got it from the manufacturers?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Because...,\" Lupin hesitated, \"because these mapmakers would have wanted to lure you out of school. They'd think it extremely entertaining.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Do you know them?\" said Harry, impressed.\n\u3000\u3000\"We've met,\" he said shortly. He was looking at Harry more seriously than ever before.\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't expect me to cover up for you again, Harry. I cannot make you take Sirius Black seriously. But I would have thought that what you have heard when the dementors draw near you would have had more of an effect on you. Your parents gave their lives to keep you alive, Harry. A poor way to repay them -- gambling their sacrifice for a bag of magic tricks.\"\n\u3000\u3000He walked away, leaving Harry feeling worse by far than he had at any point in Snape's office. Slowly, he and Ron mounted the marble staircase. As Harry passed the one-eyed witch, he remembered the Invisibility Cloak -- it was still down there, but he didn't dare go and get it.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's my fault,\" said Ron abruptly. \"I persuaded you to go. Lupin's right, it was stupid, we shouldn't've done it --\"\n\u3000\u3000He broke off; they reached the corridor where the security trolls were pacing, and Hermione was walking toward them. One look at her face convinced Harry that she had heard what had happened. His heart plummeted -- had she told Professor McGonagall?\n\u3000\u3000\"Come to have a good gloat?\" said Ron savagely as she stopped in front of them. \"Or have you just been to tell on us?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Hermione. She was holding a letter in her hands and her lip was trembling. \"I just thought you ought to know... Hagrid lost his case. Buckbeak is going to be executed.\"\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER FIFTEEN\n\u3000\u3000THE QUIDDITCH FINAL\n\u3000\u3000He sent me this,\" Hermione said, holding out the letter.\n\u3000\u3000Harry took it. The parchment was damp, and enormous teardrops had smudged the ink so badly in places that it was very difficult to read.\n\u3000\u3000Dear Hermione, We lost. I'm allowed to bring him back to Hogwarts. Execution date to be fixed. Beaky has enjoyed London. I won't forget all the help you gave us.\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid\n\u3000\u3000\"They can't do this,\" said Harry. \"They can't. Buckbeak isn't dangerous.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Malfoy's dad's frightened the Committee into it,\" said Hermione, wiping her eyes. \"You know what he's like. They're a bunch of doddery old fools, and they were scared. There'll be an appeal, though, there always is. Only I can't see any hope.... Nothing will have changed.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, it will,\" said Ron fiercely. \"You won't have to do all the work alone this time, Hermione. I'll help.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, Ron!\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione flung her arms around Ron's neck and broke down completely. Ron, looking quite terrified, patted her very awkwardly on the top of the head. Finally, Hermione drew away.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron, I'm really, really sorry about Scabbers...\" she sobbed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh -- well -- he was old,\" said Ron, looking thoroughly relieved that she had let go of him. \"And he was a bit useless. You never know, Mum and Dad might get me an owl now.\"\n\u3000\u3000The safety measures imposed on the students since Black's second break-in made it impossible for Harry, Ron, and Hermione to go and visit Hagrid in the evenings. Their only chance of talking to him was during Care of Magical Creatures lessons.\n\u3000\u3000He seemed numb with shock at the verdict.\n\u3000\u3000\"S'all my fault. Got all tongue-tied. They was all sittin' there in black robes an' I kep' droppin' me notes and forgettin' all them dates yeh looked up fer me, Hermione. An' then Lucius Malfoy stood up an' said his bit, and the Committee jus' did exac'ly what he told 'em....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"There's still the appeal!\" said Ron fiercely. \"Don't give up Yet, we're working on it!\"\n\u3000\u3000They were walking back up to the castle with the rest of the class. Ahead they could see Malfoy, who was walking with Crabbe and Goyle, and kept looking back, laughing derisively.\n\u3000\u3000\"S'no good, Ron,\" said Hagrid sadly as they reached the castle steps. \"That Committee's in Lucius Malfoy's pocket. I'm jus' gonna make sure the rest o' Beaky's time is the happiest he's ever had. I owe him that....\"\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid turned around and hurried back toward his cabin, his face buried in his handkerchief.\n\u3000\u3000\"Look at him blubber!\"\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had been standing just inside the castle doors, listening.\n\u3000\u3000\"Have you ever seen anything quite as pathetic?\" said Malfoy. \"And he's supposed to be our teacher!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron both made furious moves toward Malfoy, but Hermione got there first -- SMACK!\n\u3000\u3000She had slapped Malfoy across the face with all the strength she could muster. Malfoy staggered. Harry, Ron, Crabbe, and Goyle stood flabbergasted as Hermione raised her hand again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't you dare call Hagrid pathetic, you foul -- you evil --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione!\" said Ron weakly, and he tried to grab her hand as she swung it back.\n\u3000\u3000\"Get off, Ron!\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione pulled out her wand. Malfoy stepped backward. Crabbe and Goyle looked at him for instructions, thoroughly bewildered.\n\u3000\u3000\"C'mon,\" Malfoy muttered, and in a moment, all three of them had disappeared into the passageway to the dungeons.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione!\" Ron said again, sounding both stunned and irnpressed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, you'd better beat him in the Quidditch final!\" Hermione said shrilly. \"You just better had, because I can't stand it if Slytherin wins!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We're due in Charms,\" said Ron, still goggling at Hermione. \"We'd better go.\"\n\u3000\u3000They hurried up the marble staircase toward Professor Flitwick's classroom.\n\u3000\u3000\"You're late, boys!\" said Professor Flitwick reprovingly as Harry opened the classroom door. \"Come along, quickly, wands out, we're experimenting with Cheering Charms today, we've already divided into pairs --\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron hurried to a desk at the back and opened their bags. Ron looked behind him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Where's Hermione gone?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked around too. Hermione hadn't entered the classroom, yet Harry knew she had been right next to him when he had opened the door.\n\u3000\u3000\"That's weird,\" said Harry, staring at Ron. \"Maybe -- maybe she went to the bathroom or something?\"\n\u3000\u3000But Hermione didn't turn up all lesson.\n\u3000\u3000\"She could've done with a Cheering Charm on her too,\" said Ron as the class left for lunch, all grinning broadly -- the Cheering Charms had left them with a feeling of great contentment.\n\u3000\u3000Hermione wasn't at lunch either. By the time they had finished their apple pie, the after-effects of the Cheering Charms were wearing off, and Harry and Ron had started to get slightly worried.\n\u3000\u3000\"You don't think Malfoy did something to her?\" Ron said anxiously as they hurried upstairs toward Gryffindor Tower.\n\u3000\u3000They passed the security trolls, gave the Fat Lady the password (\"Flibbertigibbet\"), and scrambled through the portrait hole into the common room.\n\u3000\u3000Hermione was sitting at a table, fast asleep, her head resting on an open Arithmancy book. They went to sit down on either side of her. Harry prodded her awake.\n\u3000\u3000\"Wh -- what?\" said Hermione, waking with a start and staring wildly around. \"Is it time to go? W -- which lesson have we got now?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Divination, but it's not for another twenty minutes,\" said Harry. \"Hermione, why didn't you come to Charms?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What? Oh no!\" Hermione squeaked. \"I forgot to go to Charms!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But how could you forget?\" said Harry. \"You were with us till we were right outside the classroom!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't believe it!\" Hermione wailed. \"Was Professor Flitwick angry? Oh, it was Malfoy, I was thinking about him and I lost track of things!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You know what, Hermione?\" said Ron, looking down at the enormous Arithmancy book Hermione had been using as a pillow. \"I reckon you're cracking up. You're trying to do too much.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No, I'm not!\" said Hermione, brushing her hair out of her eyes and staring hopelessly around for her bag. \"I just made a mistake, that's all! I'd better go and see Professor Flitwick and say sorry... I'll see you in Divination!\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione joined them at the foot of the ladder to Professor Trelawneys classroom twenty minutes later, looking extremely harrassed.\n\u3000\u3000\"I can't believe I missed Cheering Charms! And I bet they come up in our exams; Professor Flitwick hinted they might!\"\n\u3000\u3000Together they climbed the ladder into the dim, stifling tower room. Glowing on every little table was a crystal ball full of pearly white mist. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down together at the same rickety table.\n\u3000\u3000\"I thought we weren't starting crystal balls until next term,\" Ron muttered, casting a wary eye around for Professor Trelawney, in case she was lurking nearby.\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't complain, this means we've finished palmistry,\" Harry muttered back. \"I was getting sick of her flinching every time she looked at my hands.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Good day to you!\" said the familiar, misty voice, and Professor Trelawney made her usual dramatic entrance out of the shadows. Parvati and Lavender quivered with excitement, their faces lit by the milky glow of their crystal ball.\n\u3000\u3000\"I have decided to introduce the crystal ball a little earlier than I had planned,\" said Professor Trelawney, sitting with her back to the fire and gazing around. \"The fates have informed me that your examination in June will concern the Orb, and I am anxious to give you sufficient practice.\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione snorted.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, honestly... 'the fates have informed her' who sets the exam? She does! What an amazing prediction!\" she said, not troubling to keep her voice low. Harry and Ron choked back laughs.\n\u3000\u3000It was hard to tell whether Professor Trelawney had heard them as her face was hidden in shadow. She continued, however, as though she had not.\n\u3000\u3000\"Crystal gazing is a particularly refined art,\" she said dreamily. \"I do not expect any of you to See when first you peer into the Orb's infinite depths. We shall start by practicing relaxing the conscious mind and external eyes\" -- Ron began to snigger uncontrollably and had to stuff his fist in his mouth to stifle the noise -- \"so as to clear the Inner Eye and the superconscious. Perhaps, if we are lucky, some of you will see before the end of the class.\"\n\u3000\u3000And so they began. Harry, at least, felt extremely foolish, staring blankly at the crystal ball, trying to keep his mind empty when thoughts such as \"this is stupid\" kept drifting across it. It didn't help that Ron kept breaking into silent giggles and Hermione kept tutting.\n\u3000\u3000\"Seen anything yet?\" Harry asked them after a quarter of an hour's quiet crystal gazing.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, there's a burn on this table,\" said Ron, pointing. \"Someone's spilled their candle.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"This is such a waste of time,\" Hermione hissed. \"I could be practicing something useful. I could be catching up on Cheering Charms --\"\n\u3000\u3000Professor Trelawney rustled past.\n\u3000\u3000\"Would anyone like me to help them interpret the shadowy portents within their Orb?\" she murmured over the clinking of her bangles.\n\u3000\u3000I don't need help,\" Ron whispered. \"It's obvious what this means. There's going to be loads of fog tonight.\"\n\u3000\u3000Both Harry and Hermione burst out laughing.\n\u3000\u3000\"Now, really!\" said Professor Trelawney as everyone's heads turned in their direction. Parvati and Lavender were looking scandalized. \"You are disturbing the clairvoyant vibrations!\" She approached their table and peered into their crystal ball. Harry felt his heart sinking. He was sure he knew what was coming --\n\u3000\u3000\"There is something here!\" Professor Trelawney whispered, lowerng her face to the ball, so that it was reflected twice in her huge glasses. \"Something moving... but what is it?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry was prepared to bet everything he owned, Including his Firebolt, that it wasn't good news, whatever it was. And sure enough --\n\u3000\u3000\"My dear Professor Trelawney breathed, gazing up at Harry. \"It is here, plainer than ever before... my dear, stalking toward you, growing ever closer... the Gr --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, for goodness' sake!\" said Hermione loudly. \"Not that ridiculous Grim again!\"\n\u3000\u3000Professor Trelawney raised her enormous eyes to Hermione's face. Parvati whispered something to Lavender, and they both glared at Hermione too. Professor Trelawney stood up, surveying Hermione with unmistakable anger.\n\u3000\u3000\"I am sorry to say that from the moment you have arrived in this class my dear, it has been apparent that you do not have what the noble art of Divination requires. Indeed, I don't remember ever meeting a student whose mind was so hopelessly mundane.\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a moment's silence. Then --\n\u3000\u3000\"Fine!\" said Hermione suddenly, getting up and cramming Unfogging the Future back into her bag. \"Fine!\" she repeated, swinging the bag over her shoulder and almost knocking Ron off his chair. \"I give up! I'm leaving!\"\n\u3000\u3000And to the whole class's amazement, Hermione strode over to the trapdoor, kicked it open, and climbed down the ladder out of sight.\n\u3000\u3000It took a few minutes for the class to settle down again. Professor Trelawney seemed to have forgotten all about the Grim. She turned abruptly from Harry and Ron's table, breathing rather heavily as she tugged her gauzy shawl more closely to her.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ooooo!\" said Lavender suddenly, making everyone start. \"Ooooo, Professor Trelawney, I've just remembered! You saw her leaving, didn't you? Didn't you, Professor? 'Around Easter, one of our number will leave us forever!' You said it ages ago, Professor!\"\n\u3000\u3000Professor Trelawney gave her a dewy smile.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes, my dear, I did indeed know that Miss Granger would be leaving us. One hopes, however, that one might have mistaken the Signs.... The Inner Eye can be a burden, you know...\"\n\u3000\u3000Lavender and Parvati looked deeply impressed, and moved over so that Professor Trelawney could join their table instead.\n\u3000\u3000\"Some day Hermione's having, eh?\" Ron muttered to Harry, looking awed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah...\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry glanced into the crystal ball but saw nothing but swirling white mist. Had Professor Trelawney really seen the Grim again? Would he? The last thing he needed was another near-fatal accident, with the Quidditch final drawing ever nearer.\n\u3000\u3000The Easter holidays were not exactly relaxing. The third years had never had so much homework. Neville Longbottom seemed close to a nervous collapse, and he wasn't the only one.\n\u3000\u3000\"Call this a holiday!\" Seamus Finnigan roared at the common room one afternoon. \"The exams are ages away, what're they playing at?\"\n\u3000\u3000But nobody had as much to do as Hermione. Even without Divination, she was taking more subjects than anybody else. She was usually last to leave the common room at night, first to arrive at the library the next morning; she had shadows like Lupin's under her eyes, and seemed constantly close to tears.\n\u3000\u3000Ron had taken over responsibility for Buckbeak's appeal. When he wasn't doing his own work, he was poring over enormously thick volumes with names like The Handbook of Hippogriff Psychology and Fowl or Foul? A Study of Hippogriff Brutality. He was so absorbed, he even forgot to be horrible to Crookshanks.\n\u3000\u3000Harry, meanwhile, had to fit in his homework around Quidditch practice every day, not to mention endless discussions of tactics with Wood. The Gryffindor-Slytherin match would take place on the first Saturday after the Easter holidays. Slytherin was leading the tournament by exactly two hundred points. This meant (as Wood constantly reminded his team) that they needed to win the match by more than that amount to win the Cup. It also meant that the burden of winning fell largely on Harry, because capturing the Snitch was worth one hundred and fifty points.\n\u3000\u3000\"So you must catch it only if we're more than fifty points up,\" Wood told Harry constantly. \"Only if we're more than fifty points up, Harry, or we win the match but lose the Cup. You've got that, Haven't you? You must catch the Snitch only if we're --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I KNOW, OLIVER!\" Harry yelled.\n\u3000\u3000The whole of Gryffindor House was obsessed with the coming match. Gryffindor hadn't won the Quidditch Cup since the legendary Charlie Weasley (Ron's second oldest brother) had been seeker. But Harry doubted whether any of them, even Wood, wanted to win as much as he did. The enmity between Harry and Malfoy was at its highest point ever. Malfoy was still smarting ,bout the mud-throwing incident in Hogsmeade and was even more furious that Harry had somehow wormed his way out of punishment. Harry hadn't forgotten Malfoy's attempt to sabotage him in the match against Ravenclaw, but it was the matter of Buckbeak that made him most determined to beat Malfoy in front of the entire school.\n\u3000\u3000Never, in anyone's memory, had a match approached in such a highly charged atmosphere. By the time the holidays were over, tension between the two teams and their Houses was at the breaking point. A number of small scuffles broke out in the corridors, culminating in a nasty incident in which a Gryffindor fourth year and a Slytherin sixth year ended up in the hospital wing with leeks sprouting out of their ears.\n\u3000\u3000Harry was having a particularly bad time of it. He couldn't walk to class without Slytherins sticking out their legs and trying to trip him up; Crabbe and Goyle kept popping up wherever he went, and slouching away looking disappointed when they saw him surrounded by people. Wood had given instructions that Harry should be accompanied everywhere he went, in case the Slytherins tried to put him out of action. The whole of Gryffindor House took up the challenge enthusiastically, so that it was impossible for Harry to get to classes on time because he was surrounded by a vast, chattering crowd. Harry was more concerned for his Firebolt's safety than his own. When he wasn't flying it, he locked it securely in his trunk and frequently dashed back up to Gryffindor Tower at break times to check that it was still there.\n\u3000\u3000All usual pursuits were abandoned in the Gryffindor common room the night before the match. Even Hermione had Put down her books.\n\u3000\u3000\"I can't work, I can't concentrate,\" she said nervously.\n\u3000\u3000There was a great deal of noise. Fred and George Weasley were dealing with the pressure by being louder and more exuberant than ever. Oliver Wood was crouched over a model of a Quidditch field in the corner, prodding little figures across it with his wand and muttering to himself Angelina, Alicia, and Katie were laughing at Fred's and George's jokes. Harry was sitting with Ron and Hermione, removed from the center of things, trying not to think about the next day, because every time he did, he had the horrible sensation that something very large was fighting to get out of his stomach.\n\u3000\u3000\"You're going to be fine,\" Hermione told him, though she looked positively terrified.\n\u3000\u3000\"You've got a Firebolt!\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah...\" said Harry, his stomach writhing.\n\u3000\u3000It came as a relief when Wood suddenly stood up and yelled, \"Team! Bed!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry slept badly. First he dreamed that he had overslept, and that Wood was yelling, \"Where were you? We had to use Neville instead!\" Then he dreamed that Malfoy and the rest of the Slytherin team arrived for the match riding dragons. He was flying at breakneck speed, trying to avoid a spurt of flames from Malfoy's steed's mouth, when he realized he had forgotten his Firebolt. He fell through the air and woke with a start.\n\u3000\u3000It was a few seconds before Harry remembered that the match hadn't taken place yet, that he was safe in bed, and that the Slytherin team definitely wouldn't be allowed to play on dragons. He was feeling very thirsty. Quietly as he could, he got out of his four-poster and went to pour himself some water from the silver jug beneath the window.\n\u3000\u3000The grounds were still and quiet. No breath of wind disturbed the treetops in the Forbidden Forest; the Whomping Willow was motionless and innocent-looking. It looked as though the conditions for the match would be perfect.\n\u3000\u3000Harry set down his goblet and was about to turn back to his bed when something caught his eye. An animal of some kind was prowling across the silvery lawn.\n\u3000\u3000Harry dashed to his bedside table, snatched up his glasses, and put them on, then hurried back to the window. It couldn't be the Grim -- not now -- not right before the match -\n\u3000\u3000He peered out at the grounds again and, after a minute's frantic searching, spotted it. It was skirting the edge of the forest now... It wasn't the Grim at all ... it was a cat.... Harry clutched the window ledge in relief as he recognized the bottlebrush tail. It was only Crookshanks....\n\u3000\u3000Or was it only Crookshanks? Harry squinted, pressing his nose flat against the glass. Crookshanks seemed to have come to a halt. Harry was sure he could see something else moving in the shadow of the trees too.\n\u3000\u3000And just then, it emerged -- a gigantic, shaggy black dog, moving stealthily across the lawn, Crookshanks trotting at its side. Harry stared. What did this mean? If Crookshanks could see the dog as well, how could it be an omen of Harry's death?\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron!\" Harry hissed. \"Ron! Wake up!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Huh?\"\n\u3000\u3000I need you to tell me if you can see something!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"S'all dark, Harry,\" Ron muttered thickly. \"What're you or, about?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Down here --\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked quickly back out of the window.\n\u3000\u3000Crookshanks and the dog had vanished. Harry climbed onto the windowsill to look right down into the shadows of the castle, but they weren't there. Where had they gone?\n\u3000\u3000A loud snore told him Ron had fallen asleep again.\n\u3000\u3000Harry and the rest of the Gryffindor team entered the Great Hall the next day to enormous applause. Harry couldn't help grinning broadly as he saw that both the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables were applauding them too. The Slytherin table hissed loudly as they passed. Harry noticed that Malfoy looked even paler than usual.\n\u3000\u3000Wood spent the whole of breakfast urging his team to eat, while touching nothing himself Then he hurried them off to the field before anyone else had finished, so they could get an idea of the conditions. As they left the Great Hall, everyone applauded again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Good luck, Harry!\" called Cho. Harry felt himself blushing.\n\u3000\u3000\"Okay -- no wind to speak of -- sun's a bit bright, that could impair your vision, watch out for it -- ground's fairly hard, good, that'll give us a fast kickoff --\"\n\u3000\u3000Wood paced the field, staring around with the team behind him. Finally, they saw the front doors of the castle open in the distance and the rest of the school spilling onto the lawn.\n\u3000\u3000\"Locker rooms,\" said Wood tersely.\n\u3000\u3000None of them spoke as they changed into their scarlet robes. Harry wondered if they were feeling like he was: as though he'd eaten something extremely wriggly for breakfast. In what seemed like no time at all, Wood was saying, \"Okay, it's time, let's go --\"\n\u3000\u3000They walked out onto the field to a tidal wave of noise. Threequarters of the crowd was wearing scarlet rosettes, waving scarlet flags with the Gryffindor lion upon them, or brandishing banners with slogans like \"GO GRYFFINDOR!\" and \"LIONS FOR THE CUK' Behind the Slytherin goal posts, however, two hundred people were wearing green; the silver serpent of Slytherin glittered on their flags, and Professor Snape sat in the very front row, wearing green like everyone else, and a very grim smile.\n\u3000\u3000\"And here are the Gryffindors!\" yelled Lee Jordan, who was acting as commentator as usual. \"Potter, Bell, Johnson, Spinnet, Weasley, Weasley, and Wood. Widely acknowledged as the best team Hogwarts has seen in a good few years --\"\n\u3000\u3000Lee's comments were drowned by a tide of \"boos\" from the Slytherin end.\n\u3000\u3000\"And here come the Slytherin team, led by Captain Flint. He's Made some changes in the lineup and seems to be going for size rather than skill --\"\n\u3000\u3000More boos from the Slytherin crowd. Harry, however, thought Lee had a point. Malfoy was easily the smallest person On the Slytherin team; the rest of them were enormous.\n\u3000\u3000\"Captains, shake hands!\" said Madam Hooch.\n\u3000\u3000Flint and Wood approached each other and grasped each other's hand very tightly; it looked as though each was trying to break the other's fingers.\n\u3000\u3000\"Mount your brooms!\" said Madam Hooch. \"Three... two... one...\"\n\u3000\u3000The sound of her whistle was lost in the roar from the crowd as fourteen brooms rose into the air. Harry felt his hair fly back off his forehead; his nerves left him in the thrill of the flight; he glanced around, saw Malfoy on his tail, and sped off in search of the Snitch.\n\u3000\u3000\"And it's Gryffindor in possession, Alicia Spinner of Gryffindor with the Quaffle, heading straight for the Slytherin goal posts, looking good, Alicia! Argh, no -- Quaffle intercepted by Warrington, Warrington of Slytherin tearing UP the field -- WHAM! -- nice Bludger work there by George Weasley, Warrington drops the Quaffle, it's caught by -- Johnson, Gryffindor back in possession, come on, Angelina -- nice swerve around Montague -- duck, Angelina, that's a Bludger!- SHE SCORES! TEN-ZERO TO GRYFFINDOR!\"\n\u3000\u3000Angelina punched the air as she soared around the end of the field; the sea of scarlet below was screaming its delight\n\u3000\u3000\"OUCH!\"\n\u3000\u3000Angelina was nearly thrown from her broom as Marcus Flint went smashing into her.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sorry!\" said Flint as the crowd below booed. \"Sorry, didn't see her!\"\n\u3000\u3000A moment later, Fred Weasley chucked his Beater's club at the back of Flint's head. Flint's nose smashed into the handle of his broom and began to bleed.\n\u3000\u3000\"That will do!\" shrieked Madam Hooch, zooming between then. \"Penalty shot to Gryffindor for an unprovoked attack on their Chaser! Penalty shot to Slytherin for deliberate damage to their Chaser!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Come off it, Miss!\" howled Fred, but Madam Hooch blew her whistle and Alicia flew forward to take the penalty.\n\u3000\u3000\"Come on, Alicia!\" yelled Lee into the silence that had descended on the crowd. \"YES! SHE'S BEATEN THE KEEPER! TWENTY-ZERO TO GRYFFINDOR!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry turned the Firebolt sharply to watch Flint, still bleeding freely, fly forward to take the Slytherin penalty. Wood was hovering in front of the Gryffindor goal posts, his jaw clenched.\n\u3000\u3000\"'Course, Wood's a superb Keeper!\" Lee Jordan told the crowd as Flint waited for Madam Hooch's whistle. \"Superb! Very difficult to pass -- very difficult indeed -- YES! I DON'T BELIEVE IT! HE'S SAVED IT!\"\n\u3000\u3000Relieved, Harry zoomed away, gazing around for the Snitch, but still making sure he caught every word of Lee's commentary. It was essential that he hold Malfoy off the Snitch until Gryffindor was more than fifty points up --\n\u3000\u3000\"Gryffindor in possession, no, Slytherin in possession -- no!\n\u3000\u3000Gryffindor back in possession and it's Katie Bell, Katie Bell for Gryffindor with the Quaffle, she's streaking up the field -- THAT WAS DELIBERATE!\"\n\u3000\u3000Montague, a Slytherin Chaser, had swerved in front of Katie, and instead of seizing the Quaffle had grabbed her head. Katie cart wheeled in the air, managed to stay on her broom, but dropped the Quaffle.\n\u3000\u3000Madam Hooch's whistle rang out again as she soared over to Montague and began shouting at him. A minute later, Katie had put another penalty past the Slytherin Seeker.\n\u3000\u3000\"THIRTY-ZERO! TAKE THAT, YOU DIRTY, CHEATING --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Jordan, if you can't commentate in an unbiased way --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm telling it like it is, Professor!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry felt a huge jolt of excitement. He had seen the Snitch it was shimmering at the foot of one of the Gryffindor goal posts -- but he mustn't catch it yet -- and if Malfoy saw it -\n\u3000\u3000Faking a look of sudden concentration, Harry pulled his Firebolt around and sped off toward the Slytherin end -- it worked. Malfoy went haring after him, clearly thinking Harry had seen the Snitch there....\n\u3000\u3000WHOOSH.\n\u3000\u3000One of the Bludgers came streaking past Harry's right ear, hit by the gigantic Slytherin Beater, Derrick. Then again\n\u3000\u3000WHOOSH.\n\u3000\u3000The second Bludger grazed Harry's elbow. The other Beater, Bole, was closing in.\n\u3000\u3000Harry had a fleeting glimpse of Bole and Derrick zooming toward him, clubs raised --\n\u3000\u3000He turned the Firebolt upward at the last second, and Bole and Derrick collided with a sickening crunch.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ha haaa!\" yelled Lee Jordan as the Slytherin Beaters lurched away from each other, clutching their heads. \"Too bad, boys! You'll need to get up earlier than that to beat a Firebold And it's Gryffindor in possession again, as Johnson takes the Quaffle -- Flint alongside her -- poke him in the eye, Angelina! -- it was a joke, Professor, it was a joke -- oh no -- Flint in possession, Flint flying toward the Gryffindor goal posts, come on now, Wood, save --!\"\n\u3000\u3000But Flint had scored; there was an eruption of cheers from the Slytherin end, and Lee swore so badly that Professor McGonagall tried to tug the magical megaphone away from him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sorry, Professor, sorry! WoiA happen again! So, Gryffindor in the lead, thirty points to ten, and Gryffindor in possession --\"\n\u3000\u3000it was turning into the dirtiest game Harry had ever played in. Enraged that Gryffindor had taken such an early lead, the Slytherins were rapidly resorting to any means to take the Quaffle. Bole hit Alicia with his club and tried to say he'd thought she was a Bludger. George Weasley elbowed Bole in the face in retaliation. Madam Hooch awarded both teams penalties, and Wood pulled off another spectacular save, making the score forty-ten to Gryffindor.\n\u3000\u3000The Snitch had disappeared again. Malfoy was still keeping close to Harry as he soared over the match, looking around for it once Gryffindor was fifty points ahead -\n\u3000\u3000Katie scored. Fifty-ten. Fred and George Weasley were swooping around her, clubs raised, in case any of the Slytherins were thinking of revenge. Bole and Derrick took advantage of Fred's and George's absence to aim both Bludgers at Wood; they caught him in the stomach, one after the other, and he rolled over in the air, clutching his broom, completely winded.\n\u3000\u3000Madam Hooch was beside herself\n\u3000\u3000\"YOU DO NOT ATTACK THE KEEPER UNLESS THE QUAFFLE IS WITHIN THE SCORING AREA!\" she shrieked at Bole and Derrick. \"Gryffindor penalty!\"\n\u3000\u3000And Angelina scored. Sixty-ten. Moments later, Fred Weasley pelted a Bludger at Warrington, knocking the Quaffle Out of his hands; Alicia seized it and put it through the Slytherin goal -- seventy-ten.\n\u3000\u3000The Gryffindor crowd below was screaming itself hoarse -- Gryffindor was sixty points in the lead, and if Harry caught the Snitch now, the Cup was theirs. Harry could almost feel hundreds of eyes following him as he soared around the field, high above the rest of the game, with Malfoy speeding along behind him.\n\u3000\u3000And then he saw it. The Snitch was sparkling twenty feet above him.\n\u3000\u3000Harry put on a huge burst of speed; the wind was roaring in his ears; he stretched out his hand, but suddenly, the Firebolt was slowing down --\n\u3000\u3000Horrified, he looked around. Malfoy had thrown himself forward, grabbed hold of the Firebolt's tail, and was pulling it back.\n\u3000\u3000\"You --\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry was angry enough to hit Malfoy, but couldn't reach -- Malfoy was panting with the effort of holding onto the Firebolt, but his eyes were sparkling maliciously. He had achieved what he'd wanted to do -- the Snitch had disappeared again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Penalty! Penalty to Gryffindor! I've never seen such tactics.\" Madam Hooch screeched, shooting up to where Malfoy was sliding back onto his Nimbus Two Thousand and One.\n\u3000\u3000\"YOU CHEATING SCUM!\" Lee Jordan was howling into the megaphone, dancing out of Professor McGonagall's reach. \"YOU FILTHY, CHEATING B --\"\n\u3000\u3000Pprofessor McGonagall didn't even bother to tell him off She was actually shaking her finger in Malfoys direction, her hat had fallen off, and she too was shouting furiously.\n\u3000\u3000Alicia took Gryffindor's penalty, but she was so angry she missed by several feet. The Gryffindor team was losing concentration and the Slytherins, delighted by Malfoy's foul on Harry, were being spurred on to greater heights.\n\u3000\u3000\"Slytherin in possession, Slytherin heading for goal -- Montague scores --\" Lee groaned. \"Seventy- twenty to Gryffindor...\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry was now marking Malfoy so closely their knees kept hitting each other. Harry wasn't going to let Malfoy anywhere near the Snitch....\n\u3000\u3000\"Get out of it, Potter!\" Malfoy yelled in frustration as he tried to turn and found Harry blocking him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Angelina Johnson gets the Quaffle for Gryffindor, come on, Angelina, COME ON!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked around. Every single Slytherin player apart from Malfoy was streaking up the pitch toward Angelina, including the Slytherin Keeper -- they were all going to block her --\n\u3000\u3000Harry wheeled the Firebolt around, bent so low he was lying flat along the handle, and kicked it forward. Like a bullet, he shot toward the Slytherins.\n\u3000\u3000\"AAAAAAARRRGH!\"\n\u3000\u3000They scattered as the Firebolt zoomed toward them; Angelina's Way was clear.\n\u3000\u3000\"SHE SCORES! SHE SCORES! Gryffindor leads by eighty Points to twenty!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry, who had almost pelted headlong into the stands, skidded to a halt in midair, reversed, and zoomed back into the middle of the field.\n\u3000\u3000And then he saw something to make his heart stand still. Malfoy was diving, a look of triumph on his face -- there, a few feet above the grass below, was a tiny, golden glimmer -\n\u3000\u3000Harry urged the Firebolt downward, but Malfoy was miles ahead -\n\u3000\u3000\"Go! Go! Go!\" Harry urged his broom. He was gaining on Malfay -- Harry flattened himself to the broom handle as Bole sent a Bludger at him -- he was at Malfoy's ankles -- he was level --\n\u3000\u3000Harry threw himself forward, took both hands off his broom. He knocked Malfoy's arm out of the way and --\n\u3000\u3000\"YES!\"\n\u3000\u3000He pulled out of his dive, his hand in the air, and the stadium exploded. Harry soared above the crowd, an odd ringing in his ears. The tiny golden ball was held tight in his fist, beating its wings hopelessly against his fingers.\n\u3000\u3000Then Wood was speeding toward him, half-blinded by tears; he seized Harry around the neck and sobbed unrestrainedly into his shoulder. Harry felt two large thumps as Fred and George hit them; then Angelina's, Alicia's, and Katie's voices, \"We've won the Cup! We've won the Cup!\" Tangled together in a many-armed hug, the Gryffindor team sank, yelling hoarsely, back to earth.\n\u3000\u3000Wave upon wave of crimson supporters was pouring over the barriers onto the field. Hands were raining down on their backs. Harry had a confused impression of noise and bodies pressing in on him. Then he, and the rest of the team, were hoisted onto the shoulders of the crowd. Thrust into the light, he saw Hagrid, Plastered with crimson rosettes -- \"Yeh beat 'em, Harry, yeh beat 'em!\n\u3000\u3000Wait till I tell Buckbeak!\" There was Percy, jumping up and down like a maniac, all dignity forgotten. Professor McGonagall was sobbing harder even than Wood, wiping her eyes with an enormous Gryffindor flag; and there, fighting their way toward Harry, were Ron and Hermione. Words failed them. They simply beamed as Harry was borne toward the stands, where Dumbledore stood waiting with the enormous Quidditch Cup.\n\u3000\u3000If only there had been a dementor around.... As a sobbing Wood passed Harry the Cup, as he lifted it into the air, Harry felt he could have produced the world's best Patronus.\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER SIXTEEN\n\u3000\u3000PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY'S PREDICTION\n\u3000\u3000Harry's euphoria at finally winning the Quidditch Cup lasted at least a week. Even the weather seemed to be celebrating; as June approached, the days became cloudless and sultry, and all anybody felt like doing was strolling onto the grounds and flopping down on the grass with several pints of iced pumpkin juice, perhaps playing a casual game of Gobstones or watching the giant squid propel itself dreamily across the surface of the lake.\n\u3000\u3000But they couldn't. Exams were nearly upon them, and instead of lazing around outside, the students were forced to remain inside the castle, trying to bully their brains into concentrating while enticing wafts of summer air drifted in through the windows. Even Fred and George Weasley had been spotted working; they were about to take their O.W.L.s (Ordinary Wizarding Levels). Percy was getting ready to take his N.E.W.T.s (Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests), the highest qualification Hogwarts offered. As Percy hoped to enter the Ministry of Magic, he needed top grades. He was becoming increasingly edgy, and gave very severe punishments to anybody who disturbed the quiet of the common room in the evenings. In fact, the only person who seemed more anxious than Percy was Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron had given up asking her how she was managing to attend several classes at once, but they couldn't restrain themselves when they saw the exam schedule she had drawn up for herself. The first column read:\n\u3000\u3000Monday\n\u3000\u30009 o'clock, Arithmancy\n\u3000\u30009 o'clock, Transfiguration\n\u3000\u3000Lunch\n\u3000\u30001 o'clock, Charms\n\u3000\u30001 o'clock, Ancient Runes\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione?\" Ron said cautiously, because she was liable to explode when interrupted these days. \"Er -- are you sure you've copied down these times right?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" snapped Hermione, picking up the exam schedule and examining it. \"Yes, of course I have.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Is there any point asking how you're going to sit for two exams at once?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Hermione shortly. \"Have either of you seen my copy of Numerology and Gramatica?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, yeah, I borrowed it for a bit of bedtime reading,\" said Ron, but very quietly. Hermione started shifting heaps of parchment Harry, Ron, and Hermione plenty of opportunity to speak to Hagrid.\n\u3000\u3000\"Beaky's gettin' a bit depressed,\" Hagrid told them, bending low on the pretense of checking that Harry's flobberworm was still alive. \"Bin cooped up too long. But still... we'll know day after tomorrow -- one way or the other --\"\n\u3000\u3000They had Potions that afternoon, which was an unqualified disaster. Try as Harry might, he couldn't get his Confusing Concoction to thicken, and Snape, standing watch with an air of vindictive pleasure, scribbled something that looked suspiciously like a zero onto his notes before moving away.\n\u3000\u3000Then came Astronomy at midnight, up on the tallest tower; History of Magic on Wednesday morning, in which Harry scribbled everything Florean Fortescue had ever told him about medieval witch-hunts, while wishing he could have had one of Fortescue's choco-nut sundaes with him in the stifling classroom. Wednesday afternoon meant Herbology, in the greenhouses under a baking-hot sun; then back to the common room once more, with sunburnt necks, thinking longingly of this time next day, when it would all be over.\n\u3000\u3000Their second to last exam, on Thursday morning, was Defense Against the Dark Arts. Professor Lupin had compiled the most unusual exam any of them had ever taken; a sort of obstacle course outside in the sun, where they had to wade across a deep paddling pool containing a grindylow, cross a series of potholes full of Red Caps, squish their way across a patch of marsh while ignoring misleading directions from a hinkypunk, then climb into an old trunk and battle with a new boggart.\n\u3000\u3000\"Excellent, Harry,\" Lupin muttered as Harry climbed out of the trunk, grinning. \"Full marks.\"\n\u3000\u3000Flushed with his success, Harry hung around to watch Ron and Hermione. Ron did very well until he reached the hinkypunk, which successfully confused him into sinking waist-high into the quagmire. Hermione did everything perfectly until she reached the trunk with the boggart in it. After about a minute inside it, she burst out again, screaming.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione!\" said Lupin, startled. \"What's the matter?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"P -- P -- Professor McGonagall!\" Hermione gasped, pointing into the trunk. \"Sh -- she said I'd failed everything!\"\n\u3000\u3000It took a little while to calm Hermione down. When at last she had regained a grip on herself, she, Harry, and Ron went back to the castle. Ron was still slightly inclined to laugh at Hermione's boggart, but an argument was averted by the sight that met them on the top of the steps.\n\u3000\u3000Cornelius Fudge, sweating slightly in his pinstriped cloak, was standing there staring out at the grounds. He started at the sight of Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hello there, Harry!\" he said. \"Just had an exam, I expect? Nearly finished?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" said Harry. Hermione and Ron, not being on speaking terms with the Minister of Magic, hovered awkwardly in the background.\n\u3000\u3000\"Lovely day,\" said Fudge, casting an eye over the lake.\n\u3000\u3000\"Pity... pity...\"\n\u3000\u3000He sighed deeply and looked down at Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm here on an unpleasant mission, Harry. The Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures required a witness to the execution of a mad hippogriff. As I needed to visit Hogwarts to check on the Black situation, I was asked to step in.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Does that mean the appeal's already happened?\" Ron interrupted, stepping forward.\n\u3000\u3000\"No, no, it's scheduled for this afternoon,\" said Fudge, looking curiously at Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Then you might not have to witness an execution at A!\" said Eon stoutly. \"The hippogriff might get off!\"\n\u3000\u3000Before Fudge could answer, two wizards came through the castle doors behind him. One was so ancient he appeared to be withering before their very eyes; the other was tall and strapping, with a thin back mustache. Harry gathered that they were representatives of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures, because tie very old wizard squinted toward Hagrid's cabin and said in a feeble voice, \"Dear, dear, I'm getting too old for this.... Two o'clock, isn't it, Fudge?\"\n\u3000\u3000The black-mustached man was fingering something in his belt; Harry looked and saw that he was running one broad thumb along the blade of a shining axe. Ron opened his mouth to say something, but Hermione nudged him hard in the ribs and jerked her head toward the entrance hall.\n\u3000\u3000\"Why'd you stop me?\" said Ron angrily as they entered the Great Hall for lunch. \"Did you see them? They've even got the axe ready! This isn't justice!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron, your dad works for the Ministry, you can't go saying things like that to his boss!\" said Hermione, but she too looked very upset. \"As long as Hagrid keeps his head this time, and argue, hi case properly, they can't possibly execute Buckbeak....\"\n\u3000\u3000But Harry could tell Hermione didn't really believe what she was saying. All around them, people were talking excitedly as they ate their lunch, happily anticipating the end of the exams that afternoon, but Harry, Ron, and Hermione, lost in worry about Hagrid and Buckbeak, didn't join in.\n\u3000\u3000Harry's and Ron's last exam was Divination; Hermione's, Muggle Studies. They walked up the marble staircase together; Hermione left them on the first floor and Harry and Ron proceeded all the way up to the seventh, where many of their class were sitting on the spiral staircase to Professor Trelawney's classroom, trying to cram in a bit of last-minute studying.\n\u3000\u3000\"She's seeing us all separately,\" Neville informed them as they went to sit down next to him. He had his copy of Unfogging the Future open on his lap at the pages devoted to crystal gazing. \"Have either of you ever seen anything in a crystal ball?\" he asked them unhappily.\n\u3000\u3000\"Nope,\" said Ron in an offhand voice. He kept checking his watch; Harry. knew that he was counting down the time until Buckbeak's appeal started.\n\u3000\u3000The line of people outside the classroom shortened very slowly. As each person climbed back down the silver ladder, the rest of the class hissed, \"What did she ask? Was it okay?\"\n\u3000\u3000But they all refused to say.\n\u3000\u3000\"She says the crystal ball's told her that if I tell you, I'll have a horrible accident!\" squeaked Neville as he clambered back down the ladder toward Harry and Ron, who had now reached the landing.\n\u3000\u3000\"That's convenient,\" snorted Ron. \"You know, I'm starting to think Hermione was right about her\" -- he jabbed his thumb toward the trapdoor overhead -- \"she's a right old fraud.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah,\" said Harry, looking at his own watch. It-was now two o'clock. \"Wish she'd hurry up...\"\n\u3000\u3000Parvati came back down the ladder glowing with pride.\n\u3000\u3000\"She says I've got all the makings of a true Seer,\" she informed Harry and Ron. \"I saw loads of stuff... Well, good luck!\"\n\u3000\u3000She hurried off down the spiral staircase toward Lavender.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ronald Weasley,\" said the familiar, misty voice from over their heads. Ron grimaced at Harry and climbed the silver ladder out of sight. Harry was now the only person left to be tested. He settled himself on the floor with his back against the wall, listening to a fly buzzing in the sunny window, his mind across the grounds with Hagrid.\n\u3000\u3000Finally, after about twenty minutes, Ron's large feet reappeared on the ladder.\n\u3000\u3000\"How'd it go?\" Harry asked him, standing up.\n\u3000\u3000\"Rubbish,\" said Ron. \"Couldn't see a thing, so I made some stuff up. Don't think she was convinced, though....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Meet you in the common room,\" Harry muttered as Professor Trelawney's voice called, \"Harry Potter!\"\n\u3000\u3000The tower room was hotter than ever before; the curtains were closed, the fire was alight, and the usual sickly scent made Harry cough as he stumbled through the clutter of chairs and table to where Professor Trelawney sat waiting for him before a large crystal ball.\n\u3000\u3000\"Good day, my dear,\" she said softly. \"If you would kindly gaze into the Orb.... Take your time, now... then tell me what you see within it....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry bent over the crystal ball and stared, stared as hard as he could, willing it to show him something other than swirling white fog, but nothing happened.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well?\" Professor Trelawney prompted delicately. \"What do you see?\"\n\u3000\u3000The heat was overpowering and his nostrils were stinging with the perfumed smoke wafting from the fire beside them. He thought of what Ron had just said, and decided to pretend.\n\u3000\u3000\"Er --\" said Harry, \"a dark shape... um...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What does it resemble?\" whispered Professor Trelawney. \"Think, now...\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry cast his mind around and it landed on Buckbeak.\n\u3000\u3000\"A hippogriff,\" he said firmly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Indeed!\" whispered Professor Trelawney, scribbling keenly on the parchment perched upon her knees. \"My boy, you may well be seeing the outcome of poor Hagrid's trouble with the Ministry of Magic! Look closer... Does the hippogriff appear to... have its head?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" said Harry firmly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Are you sure?\" Professor Trelawney urged him. \"Are you quite sure, dear? You don't see it writhing on the ground, perhaps, and a shadowy figure raising an axe behind it?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No!\" said Harry, starting to feel slightly sick.\n\u3000\u3000\"No blood? No weeping Hagrid?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No!\" said Harry again, wanting more than ever to leave the room and the heat. \"It looks fine, it's - - flying away...\"\n\u3000\u3000Professor Trelawney sighed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, dear, I think we'll leave it there.... A little disappointing... but I'm sure you did your best.\"\n\u3000\u3000Relieved, Harry got up, picked up his bag and turned to go, but then a loud, harsh voice spoke behind him.\n\u3000\u3000\"IT WILL HAPPEN TONIGHT.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry wheeled around. Professor Trelawney had gone rigid in her armchair; her eyes were unfocused and her mouth sagging.\n\u3000\u3000\"S -- sorry?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000But Professor Trelawney didn't seem to hear him. Her eyes started to roll. Harry sat there in a panic. She looked as though she was about to have some sort of seizure. He hesitated, thinking of running to the hospital wing -- and then Professor Trelawney spoke again, in the same harsh voice, quite unlike her own:\n\u3000\u3000\"THE DARK LORD LIES ALONE AND FRIENDLESS, ABANDONED BY HIS FOLLOWERS. HIS SERVANT HAS BEEN CHAINED THESE TWELVE YEARS. TONIGHT, BEFORE MIDNIGHT... THE SERVANT WILL BREAK FREE AND SET OUT TO REJOIN HIS MASTER. THE DARK LORD WILL RISE AGAIN WITH HIS SERVANTS AID, GREATER AND MORE TERRIBLE THAN EVER HE WAS. TONIGHT... BEFORE MIDNIGHT... THE SERVANT... WILL SET OU... TO REJOIN... HIS MASTER....\n\u3000\u3000Professor Trelawney's head fell forward onto her chest. She made a grunting sort of noise. Harry sat there, staring at her. Then, quite suddenly, Professor Trelawney's head snapped up again.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm so sorry, dear boy,\" she said dreamily, \"the heat of the day, you know... I drifted off for a moment....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry sat there, staring at her.\n\u3000\u3000\"Is there anything wrong, my dear?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You -- you just told me that the -- the Dark Lord's going to rise again... that his servant's going to go back to him.\n\u3000\u3000Professor Trelawney looked thoroughly startled.\n\u3000\u3000\"The Dark Lord? He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named? My dear boy, that's hardly something to joke about.... Rise again, indeed --\"\n\u3000\u3000,'But you just said it! You. said the Dark Lord --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I think you must have dozed off too, dear!\" said Professor Trelawney. \"I would certainly not presume to predict anything quite as far-fetched as that!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry climbed back down the ladder and the spiral staircase, wondering... had he just heard Professor Trelawney make a real prediction? Or had that been her idea of an impressive end to the test?\n\u3000\u3000Five minutes later he was dashing past the security trolls outside the entrance to Gryffindor Tower, Professor Trelawney's words still resounding in his head. People were striding past him in the opposite direction, laughing and joking, heading for the grounds and a bit of long-awaited freedom; by the time he had reached the portrait hole and entered the common room, it was almost deserted. Over in the corner, however, sat Ron and Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor Trelawney,\" Harry panted, \"just told me --\"\n\u3000\u3000But he stopped abruptly at the sight of their faces.\n\u3000\u3000\"Buckbeak lost,\" said Ron weakly. \"Hagrid's just sent this.\"\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid's note was dry this time, no tears had splattered it, yet his hand seemed to have shaken so much as he wrote that it was hardly legible.\n\u3000\u3000Lost appeal. They're going to execute at sunset. Nothing you can do. Don't come down. I don't want you to see it.\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid\n\u3000\u3000\"We've got to go,\" said Harry at once. \"He can't just sit there on his own, waiting for the executioner!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Sunset, though,\" said Ron, who was staring out the window ill a glazed sort of way. \"We'd never be allowed... 'specially you, Harry....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry sank his head into his hands, thinking.\n\u3000\u3000\"If we only had the Invisibility Cloak....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Where is it?\" said Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000Harry told her about leaving it in the passageway under the one-eyed witch.\n\u3000\u3000\"... if Snape sees me anywhere near there again, I'm in serious trouble,\" he finished.\n\u3000\u3000\"That's true,\" said Hermione, getting to her feet. \"If he sees you.... How do you open the witch's hump again?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You -- you tap it and say, 'Dissendium,'\" said Harry. \"But --\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione didn't wait for the rest of his sentence; she strode across the room, pushed open the Fat Lady's portrait and vanished from sight.\n\u3000\u3000\"She hasn't gone to get it?\" Ron said, staring after her.\n\u3000\u3000She had. Hermione returned a quarter of an hour later with the silvery cloak folded carefully under her robes.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione, I don't know what's gotten, into you lately!\" said Ron, astounded. \"First you hit Malfoy, then you walk out on Professor Trelawney --\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione looked rather flattered.\n\u3000\u3000They went down to dinner with everybody else, but did not return to Gryffindor Tower afterward. Harry had the cloak hidden down tie front of his robes; he had to keep his arms folded to hide the lump. They skulked in an empty chamber off the entrance hall, listening, until they were sure it was deserted. They heard a last pair of people hurrying across the hall and a door slamming. Hermione poked her head around the door.\n\u3000\u3000\"Okay,\" she whispered, \"no one there -- cloak on --\"\n\u3000\u3000Walking very close together so that nobody would see them, they crossed the hall on tiptoe beneath the cloak, then walked down the stone front steps into the grounds. The sun was already sinking behind the Forbidden Forest, gilding the top branches of the trees.\n\u3000\u3000They reached Hagrid's cabin and knocked. He was a minute in answering, and when he did, he looked all around for his visitor, pale-faced and trembling.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's us,\" Harry hissed. \"We're wearing the Invisibility Cloak. Let us in and we can take it off.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeh shouldn've come!\" Hagrid whispered, but he stood back, and they stepped inside. Hagrid shut the door quickly and Harry pulled off the cloak.\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid was not crying, nor did he throw himself upon their necks. He looked like a man who did not know where he was or what to do. This helplessness was worse to watch than tears.\n\u3000\u3000\"Wan' some tea?\" he said. His great hands were shaking as he reached for the kettle.\n\u3000\u3000\"Where's Buckbeak, Hagrid?\" said Hermione hesitantly.\n\u3000\u3000I -- I took him outside,\" said Hagrid, spilling milk all over the table as he filled up the jug. \"He's tethered in me pumpkin patch. Thought he oughta see the trees an' -- an' smell fresh air -- before\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid's hand trembled so violently that the milk jug slipped from his grasp and shattered all over the floor.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll do it, Hagrid,\" said Hermione quickly, hurrying over and starting to clean up the mess.\n\u3000\u3000\"There's another one in the cupboard,\" Hagrid said, sitting down and wiping his forehead on his sleeve. Harry glanced at Ron, who looked back hopelessly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Isn't there anything anyone can do, Hagrid?\" Harry asked fiercely, sitting down next to him. \"Dumbledore --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He's tried,\" said Hagrid. \"He's got no power ter overrule the Committee. He told 'em Buckbeak's all right, but they're scared.... Yeh know what Lucius Malfoy's like... threatened 'em, I expect... an' the executioner, Macnair, he's an old pal o' Malfoy's... but it'll be quick an' clean... an' I'll be beside him.... \"\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid swallowed. His eyes were darting all over the cabin as though looking for some shred of hope or comfort.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dumbledore's gonna come down while it -- while it happens. Wrote me this mornin'. Said he wants ter -- ter be with me. Great man, Dumbledore....\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione, who had been rummaging in Hagrid's cupboard for another milk jug, let out a small, quickly stifled sob. She straightened up with the new jug in her hands, fighting back tears.\n\u3000\u3000\"We'll stay with you too, Hagrid,\" she began, but Hagrid shook his shaggy head.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeh're ter go back up ter the castle. I told yeh, I don' wan' yeh watchin'. An' yeh shouldn' be down here anyway... If Fudge an' Dumbledore catch yeh out without permission, Harry, yeh'll be in big trouble.\"\n\u3000\u3000Silent tears were now streaming down Hermione's face, but she hid them from Hagrid, bustling around making tea. Then, as she picked up the milk bottle to pour some into the jug, she let out a shriek.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron, I don't believe it -- it's Scabbers!\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron gaped at her.\n\u3000\u3000\"What are you talking about?\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione carried the milk jug over to the table and turned it upside down. With a frantic squeak, and much scrambling to get back inside, Scabbers the rat came sliding out onto the table.\n\u3000\u3000\"Scabbers!\" said Ron blankly. \"Scabbers, what are you doing here?\"\n\u3000\u3000He grabbed the struggling rat and held him up to the light. Scabbers looked dreadful. He was thinner than ever, large tufts of hair had fallen out leaving wide bald patches, and he writhed in Ron's hands as though desperate to free himself\n\u3000\u3000\"It's okay, Scabbers!\" said Ron. \"No cats! There's nothing here to hurt you!\"\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid suddenly stood up, his eyes fixed on the window. His normally ruddy face had gone the color of parchment.\n\u3000\u3000\"They're comin'....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry, Ron, and Hermione whipped around. A group of men was walking down the distant castle steps. In front was Albus Dumbledore, his silver beard gleaming in the dying sun. Next to him trotted Cornelius Fudge. Behind them came the feeble old Committee member and the executioner, Macnair.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeh gotta go,\" said Hagrid. Every inch of him was trembling. \"They mustn' find yeh here.... Go now...\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron stuffed Scabbers into his pocket and Hermione picked up the cloak. \"I'll let yeh out the back way,\" said Hagrid.\n\u3000\u3000They followed him to the door into his back garden. Harry felt strangely unreal, and even more so when he saw Buckbeak a few yards away, tethered to a tree behind Hagrid's Pumpkin patch. Buckbeak seemed to know something was happening. He turned his sharp head from side to side and pawed the ground nervously.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's okay, Beaky,\" said Hagrid softly. \"It's okay...\" He turned to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. \"Go on,\" he said. \"Get goin'.\"\n\u3000\u3000But they didn't move.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hagrid, we can't --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We'll tell them what really happened --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"They can't kill him --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Go!\" said Hagrid fiercely. \"It's bad enough without you lot in trouble an' all!\"\n\u3000\u3000They had no choice. As Hermione threw the cloak over Harry and Ron, they heard voices at the front of the cabin. Hagrid looked at the place where they had just vanished from sight.\n\u3000\u3000\"Go quick,\" he said hoarsely. \"Don' listen....\"\n\u3000\u3000And he strode back into his cabin as someone knocked at the front door.\n\u3000\u3000Slowly, in a kind of horrified trance, Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off silently around Hagrid's house. As they reached the other side, the front door closed with a sharp snap.\n\u3000\u3000\"Please, let's hurry,\" Hermione whispered. \"I can't stand it, I can't bear it....\"\n\u3000\u3000They started up the sloping lawn toward the castle. The sun was sinking fast now; the sky had turned to a clear, purple-tinged grey, but to the west there was a ruby-red glow.\n\u3000\u3000Ron stopped dead.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, please, Ron,\" Hermione began.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's Scabbers -- he won't -- stay put --\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron was bent over, trying to keep Scabbers in his pocket, but the rat was going berserk; squeaking madly, twisting and flailing, trying to sink his teeth into Ron's hand.\n\u3000\u3000\"Scabbers, it's me, you idiot, it's Ron,\" Ron hissed.\n\u3000\u3000They heard a door open behind them and men's voices.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, Ron, please let's move, they're going to do it!\" Hermione breathed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Okay -- Scabbers, stay put --\"\n\u3000\u3000They walked forward; Harry, like Hermione, was trying not to listen to the rumble of voices behind them. Ron stopped again.\n\u3000\u3000\"I can't hold him -- Scabbers, shut up, everyone'll hear us --\"\n\u3000\u3000The rat was squealing wildly, but not loudly enough to cover up the sounds drifting from Hagrid's garden. There was a jumble of indistinct male voices, a silence, and then, without warning, the unmistakable swish and thud of an axe.\n\u3000\u3000Hermione swayed on the spot.\n\u3000\u3000\"They did it!\" she whispered to Harry. \"I d -- don't believe it -- they did it!\"\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER SEVENTEEN\n\u3000\u3000CAT, RAT, AND DOG\n\u3000\u3000Harry's mind had gone blank with shock. The three of them stood transfixed with horror under the Invisibility Cloak. The very last rays of the setting sun were casting a bloody light over the long- shadowed grounds. Then, behind them, they heard a wild howling.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hagrid,\" Harry muttered. Without thinking about what he was doing, he made to turn back, but both Ron and Hermione seized his arms.\n\u3000\u3000\"We can't,\" said Ron, who was paper-white. \"He'll be in worse trouble if they know we've been to see him....\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione's breathing was shallow and uneven.\n\u3000\u3000\"How -- could -- they?\" she choked. \"How could they?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Come on,\" said Ron, whose teeth seemed to be chattering.\n\u3000\u3000They set off back toward the castle, walking slowly to keep themselves hidden under the cloak. The light was fading fast now.\n\u3000\u3000By the time they reached open ground, darkness was settling like a spell around them.\n\u3000\u3000\"Scabbers, keep still,\" Ron hissed, clamping his hand over his chest. The rat was wriggling madly. Ron came to a sudden halt, trying to force Scabbers deeper into his pocket. \"What's the matter with you, You stupid rat? Stay still -- OUCH! He bit me!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron, be quiet!\" Hermione whispered urgently. \"Fudge'll be out here in a minute --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He won't -- stay -- put --\"\n\u3000\u3000Scabbers was plainly terrified. He was writhing with all his might, trying to break free of Ron's grip.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's the matter with him?\"\n\u3000\u3000But Harry had just seen -- stinking toward them, his body low to the ground, wide yellow eyes glinting eerily in the darkness -- Crookshanks. Whether he could see them or was following the sound of Scabbers's squeaks, Harry couldn't tell.\n\u3000\u3000\"Crookshanks!\" Hermione moaned. \"No, go away, Crookshanks! Go away!\"\n\u3000\u3000But the cat was getting nearer --\n\u3000\u3000\"Scabbers -- NO!\"\n\u3000\u3000Too late -- the rat had slipped between Ron's clutching fingers, hit the ground, and scampered away. In one bound, Crookshanks sprang after him, and before Harry or Hermione could stop him, Ron had thrown the Invisibility Cloak off himself and pelted away into the darkness.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron!\" Hermione moaned.\n\u3000\u3000She and Harry looked at each other, then followed at a sprint; it \"\"as impossible to run full out under the cloak; they pulled it off and it streamed behind them like a banner as they hurtled after Ron; they could hear his feet thundering along ahead and his shouts at Crookshanks.\n\u3000\u3000\"Get away from him -- get away -- Scabbers, come here --\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a loud thud.\n\u3000\u3000\"Gotcha! Get off, you stinking cat --\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Hermione almost fell over Ron; they skidded to a stop right in front of him. He was sprawled on the ground, but Scabbers was back in his pocket; he had both hands held tight over the quivering lump.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron -- come on back under the cloak --\" Hermione panted. \"Dumbledore the Minister -- they'll be coming back out in a minute --\"\n\u3000\u3000But before they could cover themselves again, before they could even catch their breath, they heard the soft pounding of gigantic paws.... Something was bounding toward them, quiet as a shadow -- an enormous, pale-eyed, jet-black dog.\n\u3000\u3000Harry reached for his wand, but too late -- the dog had made an enormous leap and the front paws hit him on the chest; he keeled over backward in a whirl of hair; he felt its hot breath, saw inch- long teeth -\n\u3000\u3000But the force of its leap had carried it too far; it rolled off him. Dazed, feeling as though his ribs were broken, Harry tried to stand up; he could hear it growling as it skidded around for a new attack.\n\u3000\u3000Ron was on his feet. As the dog sprang back toward them he pushed Harry aside; the dog's jaws fastened instead around Ron's outstretched arm. Harry lunged forward, he seized a handful of the brute's hair, but it was dragging Ron away as easily as though he were a rag doll --\n\u3000\u3000Then, out of nowhere, something hit Harry so hard across the face he was knocked off his feet again. He heard Hermione shriek with pain and fall too.\n\u3000\u3000Harry groped for his wand, blinking blood out of his eyes\n\u3000\u3000\"Lumos!\"he whispered.\n\u3000\u3000The wandlight showed him the trunk of a thick tree; they had chased Scabbers into the shadow of the Whomping Willow and its branches were creaking as though in a high wind, whipping backward and forward to stop them going nearer.\n\u3000\u3000And there, at the base of the trunk, was the dog, dragging Ron backward into a large gap in the roots -- Ron was fighting furiously, but his head and torso were slipping out of sight --\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron!\" Harry shouted, trying to follow, but a heavy branch whipped lethally through the air and he was forced backward again.\n\u3000\u3000All they could see now was one of Ron's legs, which he had hooked around a root in an effort to stop the dog from pulling him farther underground -- but a horrible crack cut the air like a gunshot; Ron's leg had broken, and a moment later, his foot vanished from sight.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry -- we've got to go for help --\" Hermione gasped; she was bleeding too; the Willow had cut her across the shoulder.\n\u3000\u3000\"No! That thing's big enough to eat him; we haven't got time --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry -- we're never going to get through without help --\"\n\u3000\u3000Another branch whipped down at them, twigs clenched like knuckles.\n\u3000\u3000\"If that dog can get in, we can,\" Harry panted, darting here and there, trying to find a way through the vicious, swishing branches, but he couldn't get an inch nearer to the tree roots without being in range of the tree's blows.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, help, help,\" Hermione whispered frantically, dancing U._ certainly on the spot, \"Please...\"\n\u3000\u3000Crookshanks darted forward. He slithered between the battering branches like a snake and placed his front paws upon a knot on the trunk.\n\u3000\u3000Abruptly, as though the tree had been turned to marble, it stopped moving. Not a leaf twitched or shook.\n\u3000\u3000\"Crookshanks!\" Hermione whispered uncertainly. She now grasped Harry's arm painfully hard. \"How did he know --?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He's friends with that dog,\" said Harry grimly. \"I've seen them together. Come on -- and keep your wand out --\"\n\u3000\u3000They covered the distance to the trunk in seconds, but before they had reached the gap in the roots, Crookshanks had slid into it with a flick of his bottlebrush tail. Harry went next; he crawled forward, headfirst, and slid down an earthy slope to the bottom of a very low tunnel. Crookshanks was a little way along, his eyes flashing in the light from Harry's wand. Seconds later, Hermione slithered down beside him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Where's Ron?\" she whispered in a terrified voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"This way,\" said Harry, setting off, bent-backed, after Crookshanks.\n\u3000\u3000\"Where does this tunnel come out?\" Hermione asked breathlessly from behind him.\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't know... It's marked on the Marauder's Map but Fred and George said no one's ever gotten into it.... It goes off the edge of the map, but it looked like it was heading for Hogsmeade...\"\n\u3000\u3000They moved as fast as they could, bent almost double; ahead of them, Crookshanks's tail bobbed in and out of view. On and on went the passage; it felt at least as long as the one to Honeydukes.... All Harry could think of was Ron and what the enormous dog might be doing to him.... He was drawing breath in sharp, painful gasps, running at a crouch....\n\u3000\u3000And then the tunnel began to rise; moments later it twisted, and Crookshanks had gone. instead, Harry could see a patch of dim light through a small opening.\n\u3000\u3000He and Hermione paused, gasping for breath, edging forward. Both raised their wands to see what lay beyond.\n\u3000\u3000It was a room, a very disordered, dusty room. Paper was peeling from the walls; there were stains all over the floor; every piece of furniture was broken as though somebody had smashed it. The windows were all boarded up.\n\u3000\u3000Harry glanced at Hermione, who looked very frightened but nodded.\n\u3000\u3000Harry pulled himself out of the hole, staring around. The room was deserted, but a door to their right stood open, leading to a shadowy hallway. Hermione suddenly grabbed Harry's arm again. Her wide eyes were traveling around the boarded windows.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry,\" she whispered, \"I think we're in the Shrieking Shack.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked around. His eyes fell on a wooden chair near them. Large chunks had been torn out of it; one of the legs had been ripped off entirely.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ghosts didn't do that,\" he said slowly.\n\u3000\u3000At that moment, there was a creak overhead. Something had Moved upstairs. Both of them looked up at the ceiling. Hermione's grip on Harry's arm was so tight he was losing feeling in-his fingers. He raised his eyebrows at her; she nodded again and let go.\n\u3000\u3000Quietly as they could, they crept out into the hall and UP the crumbling staircase. Everything was covered in a thick layer of dust except the floor, where a wide shiny stripe had been made by something being dragged upstairs.\n\u3000\u3000They reached the dark landing.\n\u3000\u3000\"Nox,\" they whispered together, and the lights at the end of their wands went out. Only one door was open. As they crept toward it, they heard movement from behind it; a low moan, and then a deep, loud purring. They exchanged a last look, a last nod.\n\u3000\u3000Wand held tightly before him, Harry kicked the door wide open.\n\u3000\u3000On a magnificent four-poster bed with dusty hangings lay Crookshanks, purring loudly at the sight of them. On the floor beside him, clutching his leg, which stuck out at a strange angle, was Ron.\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Hermione dashed across to him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron -- are you okay?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Where's the dog?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Not a dog,\" Ron moaned. His teeth were gritted with pain. \"Harry, it's a trap --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He's the dog... he's an Animagus.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron was staring over Harry's shoulder. Harry wheeled around. With a snap, the man in the shadows closed the door behind them.\n\u3000\u3000A mass of filthy, matted hair hung to his elbows. If eyes hadn't been shining out of the deep, dark sockets, he might have been a corpse. The waxy skin was stretched so tightly over the bones of his face, it looked like a skull. His yellow teeth were bared in a grin. It was Sirius Black.\n\u3000\u3000\"Expelliarmus!\"he croaked, pointing Ron's wand at them.\n\u3000\u3000Harry's and Hermione's wands shot out of their hands, high in the air, and Black caught them. Then he took a step closer. His eyes were fixed on Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"I thought you'd come and help your friend,\" he said hoarsely.\n\u3000\u3000His voice sounded as though he had long since lost the habit of using it. \"Your father would have done the same for me. Brave of you) not to run for a teacher. I'm grateful... it will make everything much easier....\"\n\u3000\u3000The taunt about his father rang in Harry's ears as though Black had bellowed it. A boiling hate erupted in Harry's chest, leaving no place for fear. For the first time in his life, he wanted his wand back in his hand, not to defend himself, but to attack... to kill. Without knowing what he was doing, he started forward, but there was a sudden movement on either side of him and two pairs of hands grabbed him and held him back.... \"No, Harry!\" Hermione gasped in a petrified whisper; Ron, however, spoke to Black.\n\u3000\u3000\"If you want to kill Harry, you'll have to kill us too!\" he said fiercely, though the effort of standing upright was draining him of still more color, and he swayed slightly as he spoke.\n\u3000\u3000Something flickered in Black's shadowed eyes.\n\u3000\u3000\"Lie down,\" he said quietly to Ron. \"You will damage that leg even more.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Did you hear me?\" Ron said weakly, though he was clinging painfully to Harry to stay upright. \"You'll have to kill all three of us!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"There'll be only one murder here tonight,\" said Brack, and his grin widened.\n\u3000\u3000\"Why's that?\" Harry spat, trying to wrench himself free of Ron, and Hermione. \"Didn't care last time, did you? Didn't mind slaughtering all those Muggles to get at Pettigrew... What's the matter, gone soft in Azkaban?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry!\" Hermione whimpered. \"Be quiet!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"HE KILLED MY MUM AND DAD!\" Harry roared, and with a huge effort he broke free of Hermione's and Ron's restraint and lunged forward -\n\u3000\u3000He had forgotten about magic -- he had forgotten that he was short and skinny and thirteen, whereas Black was a tall, full-grown man -- all Harry knew was that he wanted to hurt Black as badly as he could and that he didn't care how much he got hurt in return --\n\u3000\u3000Perhaps it was the shock of Harry doing something so stupid, but Black didn't raise the wands in time -- one of Harry's hands fastened over his wasted wrist, forcing the wand tips away; the knuckles of Harry's other hand collided with the side of Black's head and they fell, backward, into the wall -\n\u3000\u3000Hermione was screaming; Ron was yelling; there was a blinding flash as the wands in Black's hand sent a jet of sparks into the air that missed Harry's face by inches; Harry felt the shrunken arm under his fingers twisting madly, but he clung on, his other hand punching every part of Black it could find.\n\u3000\u3000But Black's free hand had found Harry's throat\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" he hissed, \"I've waited too long --\"\n\u3000\u3000The fingers tightened, Harry choked, his glasses askew.\n\u3000\u3000Then he saw Hermione's foot swing out of nowhere. Black let go of Harry with a grunt of pain; Ron had thrown himself on Black's wand hand and Harry heard a faint clatter --\n\u3000\u3000He fought free of the tangle of bodies and saw his own wand rolling across the floor; he threw himself toward it but\n\u3000\u3000\"Argh!\"\n\u3000\u3000Crookshanks had joined the fray; both sets of front claws had sunk themselves deep into Harry's arm; Harry threw him off, but Crookshanks now darted toward Harry's wand --\n\u3000\u3000\"NO YOU DON'T!\" roared Harry, and he aimed a kick at Crookshanks that made the cat leap aside, spitting; Harry snatched up his wand and turned -\n\u3000\u3000\"Get out of the way!\" he shouted at Ron and Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000They didn't need telling twice. Hermione, gasping for breath, her lip bleeding, scrambled aside, snatching up her and Ron's wands. Ron crawled to the four-poster and collapsed onto it, panting, his white face now tinged with green, both hands clutching his broken leg.\n\u3000\u3000Black was sprawled at the bottom of the wall. His thin chest rose and fell rapidly as he watched Harry walking slowly nearer, his wand pointing straight at Black's heart.\n\u3000\u3000\"Going to kill me, Harry?\" he whispered.\n\u3000\u3000Harry stopped right above him, his wand still pointing at Black's chest, looking down at him. A livid bruise was rising around Black's left eye and his nose was bleeding.\n\u3000\u3000\"You killed my parents,\" said Harry, his voice shaking slightly, but his wand hand quite steady.\n\u3000\u3000Black stared up at him out of those sunken eyes.\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't deny it,\" he said very quietly. \"But if you knew the whole story.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"The whole story?\" Harry repeated, a furious pounding in his ears. \"You sold them to Voldemort. That's all I need to know.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You've got to listen to me,\" Black said, and there was a note of urgency in his voice now. \"You'll regret it if you don't.... You don't understand....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I understand a lot better than you think,\" said Harry, and his voice shook more than ever. \"You never heard her, did you? My mum... trying to stop Voldemort killing me... and you did that... you did it....\"\n\u3000\u3000Before either of them could say another word, something ginger streaked past Harry; Crookshanks leapt onto Black's chest and settled himself there, right over Black's heart. Black blinked and looked down at the cat.\n\u3000\u3000\"Get off,\" he murmured, trying to push Crookshanks off him.\n\u3000\u3000But Crookshanks sank his claws into Black's robes and wouldn't shift. He turned his ugly, squashed face to Harry and looked up at him with those great yellow eyes. To his right, Hermione gave a dry sob.\n\u3000\u3000Harry stared down at Black and Crookshanks, his grip tightening on the wand. So what if he had to kill the cat too? It was in league with Black.... If it was prepared to die, trying to protect Black, that wasn't Harry's business.... If Black wanted to save it, that only proved he cared more for Crookshanks than for Harry's parents....\n\u3000\u3000Harry raised the wand. Now was the moment to do it. Now was the moment to avenge his mother and father. He was going to kill Black. He had to kill Black. This was his chance....\n\u3000\u3000The seconds lengthened. And still Harry stood frozen there, wand poised, Black staring up at him, Crookshanks on his chest. Ron's ragged breathing came from near the bed; Hermione was quite silent.\n\u3000\u3000And then came a new sound -\n\u3000\u3000Muffled footsteps were echoing up through the floor -- someone was moving downstairs.\n\u3000\u3000\"WE'RE UP HERE!\" Hermione screamed suddenly. \"WE'RE UP HERE -- SIRIUS BLACK - QUICK!\"\n\u3000\u3000Black made a startled movement that almost dislodged Crookshanks; Harry gripped his wand convulsively -- Do it now! said a voice in his head -- but the footsteps were thundering up the stairs and Harry still hadn't done it.\n\u3000\u3000The door of the room burst open in a shower of red sparks and Harry wheeled around as Professor Lupin came hurtling into the room, his face bloodless, his wand raised and ready. His eyes flickered over Ron, lying on the floor, over Hermione, cowering next to the door, to Harry, standing there with his wand covering Black, and then to Black himself, crumpled and bleeding at Harry's feet.\n\u3000\u3000\"Expelliarmus!\" Lupin shouted.\n\u3000\u3000Harry's wand flew once more out of his hand; so did the two Hermione was holding. Lupin caught them all deftly, then moved into the room, staring at Black, who still had Crookshanks lying Protectively across his chest.\n\u3000\u3000Harry stood there, feeling suddenly empty. He hadn't done it. His nerve had failed him. Black was going to be handed back to the dementors.\n\u3000\u3000Then Lupin spoke, in a very tense voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"Where is he, Sirius?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked quickly at Lupin. He didn't understannd what Lupin meant. Who was Lupin talking about? He turned to look at Black again.\n\u3000\u3000Black's face was quite expressionless. For a few seconds, he didn't move at all. Then, very slowly, he raised his empty hand and pointed straight at Ron. Mystified, Harry glanced around at Ron, who looked bewildered.\n\u3000\u3000\"But then...\" Lupin muttered, staring at Black so intently it seemed he was trying to read his mind, \"... why hasn't he shown himself before now? Unless\" -- Lupin's eyes suddenly widened, as though he was seeing something beyond Black, something none of the rest could see, \"-- unless he was the one... unless you switched... without telling me?\"\n\u3000\u3000Very slowly, his sunken gaze never leaving Lupin's face, Black nodded.\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor,\" Harry interrupted loudly, \"what's going on --?\"\n\u3000\u3000But he never finished the question, because what he saw made his voice die in his throat. Lupin was lowering his wand, gazing fixed at Black. The Professor walked to Black's side, seized his hand, pulled him to his feet so that Crookshanks fell to the floor, and embraced Black like a brother.\n\u3000\u3000Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach.\n\u3000\u3000\"DON'T BELIEVE IT!\" Hermione screamed.\n\u3000\u3000Lupin let go of Black and turned to her. She had raised herself off the floor and was pointing at Lupin, wild-eyed. \"You -- you --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"-- you and him!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione, calm down --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I didn't tell anyone!\" Hermione shrieked. \"I've been covering up for you --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione, listen to me, please'\" Lupin shouted. \"I can explain --\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry could feel himself shaking, not with fear, but with a fresh wave of fury.\n\u3000\u3000\"I trusted you,\" he shouted at Lupin, his voice wavering, out of control, \"and all the time you've been his friend!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You're wrong,\" said Lupin. \"I haven't been Sirius's friend, but I am now -- Let me explain....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"NO!\" Hermione screamed. \"Harry, don't trust him, he's been helping Black get into the castle, he wants you dead too -- he's a werewolf!\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a ringing silence. Everyone's eyes were now on Lupin, who looked remarkably calm, though rather pale.\n\u3000\u3000\"Not at all up to your usual standard, Hermione,\" he said. \"Only one out of three, I'm afraid. I have not been helping Sirius get into the castle and I certainly don't want Harry dead. An odd shiver passed over his face. \"But I won't deny that I am a werewolf.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron made a valiant effort to get up again but fell back with a whimper of pain. Lupin made toward him, looking concerned, but Ron gasped, \"Get away ftom me, werewolf!\"\n\u3000\u3000Lupin stopped dead. Then, with an obvious effort, he turned to Hermione and said, \"How long have you known?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ages,\" Hermione whispered. \"Since I did Professor Snape's essay...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He'll be delighted,\" said Lupin coolly. \"He assigned that essay hoping someone would realize what my symptoms meant.... Did you check the lunar chart and realize that I was always ill at the full moon? Or did you realize that the boggart changed into the moon when it saw me?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Both,\" Hermione said quietly.\n\u3000\u3000Lupin forced a laugh.\n\u3000\u3000\"You're the cleverest witch of your age I've ever met, Hermione.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm not,\" Hermione whispered. \"If I'd been a bit cleverer, I'd have told everyone what you are!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But they already know,\" said Lupin. \"At least, the staff do.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Dumbledore hired you when he knew you were a werewolf. Ron gasped. \"Is he mad?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Some of the staff thought so,\" said Lupin. \"He had to work very hard to convince certain teachers that I'm trustworthy --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"AND HE WAS WRONG!\" Harry yelled. \"YOUVE BEEN HELPING HIM ALL THE TIME!\" He was pointing at Black, who suddenly crossed to the four-poster bed and sank onto it, his face hidden in one shaking hand. Crookshanks leapt up beside him and stepped onto his lap, purring. Ron edged away from both of them, dragging his leg.\n\u3000\u3000I have not been helping Sirius,\" said Lupin. \"If you'll give me a chance, I'll explain. Look --\"\n\u3000\u3000He separated Harry's, Ron's and Hermione's wands and threw each back to its owner; Harry caught his, stunned.\n\u3000\u3000There, said Lupin, sticking his own wand back into his belt \"You're armed, we're not. Now will you listen?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't know what to think. Was it a trick?\n\u3000\u3000\"If you haven't been helping him,\" he said, with a furious glance at Black, \"how did you know he was here?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"The map,\" said Lupin. \"The Marauder's Map. I was in my office examining it --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You know how to work it?\" Harry said suspiciously.\n\u3000\u3000\"Of course I know how to work it,\" said Lupin, waving his hand impatiently. \"I helped write it. I'm Moony -- that was my friends' nickname for me at school.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You wrote --?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"The important thing is, I was watching it carefully this evening, because I had an idea that you, Ron, and Hermione might try and sneak out of the castle to visit Hagrid before his hippogriff was executed. And I was right, wasn't I\"\n\u3000\u3000He had started to pace up and down, looking at them. Little patches of dust rose at his feet.\n\u3000\u3000\"You might have been wearing your father's old cloak, Harry--\"\n\u3000\u3000\"How d'you know about the cloak?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"The number of times I saw James disappearing under it...,\" said Lupin, waving an impatient hand again. \"The point is, even if you're wearing an Invisibility Cloak, you still show up on the Marauder's Map. I watched you cross the grounds and enter Hagrid's hut. Twenty minutes later, you left Hagrid, and set off back toward the castle. But you were now accompanied by somebody else.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" said Harry. \"No, we weren't!\"\n\u3000\u3000I couldn't believe my eyes,\" said Lupin, still pacing, and ignoring Harry's interruption. \"I thought the map must be malfunctioning. How could he be with you?\" \"No one was with us!\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"And then I saw another dot, moving fast toward you, labeled Sirius Black.... I saw him collide with you; I watched as he pulled two of you into the Whomping Willow --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"One of us!\" Ron said angrily.\n\u3000\u3000\"No, Ron,\" said Lupin. \"Two of you.\"\n\u3000\u3000He had stopped his pacing, his eyes moving over Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Do you think I could have a look at the rat?\" he said evenly.\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" said Ron. \"What's Scabbers got to do with it?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Everything,\" said Lupin. \"Could I see him, please?\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron hesitated, then put a hand inside his robes. Scabbers emerged, thrashing desperately; Ron had to seize his long bald tail to stop him escaping. Crookshanks stood up on Black's leg and made a soft hissing noise.\n\u3000\u3000Lupin moved closer to Ron. He seemed to be holding his breath as he gazed intently at Scabbers.\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" Ron said again, holding Scabbers close to him, looking scared. \"What's my rat got to do with anything?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That's not a rat,\" croaked Sirius Black suddenly.\n\u3000\u3000\"What d'you mean -- of course he's a rat --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No, he's not,\" said Lupin quietly. \"He's a wizard.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"An Animagus,\" said Black, \"by the name of Peter Pettigrew.\"\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER EIGHTEEN\n\u3000\u3000MOONY, WORMTAIL, PADDFOOT, AND PRONGS\n\u3000\u3000It took a few seconds for the absurdity of this statement to sink in. Then Ron voiced what Harry was thinking.\n\u3000\u3000\"You're both mental.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ridiculous!\" said Hermione faintly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Peter Pettigrew's dead!\" said Harry. \"He killed him twelve years ago!\" He pointed at Black, whose face twitched convulsively.\n\u3000\u3000\"I meant to,\" he growled, his yellow teeth bared, \"but little Peter got the better of me... not this time, though!\"\n\u3000\u3000And Crookshanks was thrown to the floor as Black lunged at Scabbers; Ron yelled with pain as Black's weight fell on his broken leg.\n\u3000\u3000.\"Sirius, NO!\" Lupin yelled, launching himself forwards and dragging Black away from Ron again, \"WAIT! You can't do it just like that -- they need to understand -- we've got to explain --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We can explain afterwards!\" snarled Black, trying to throw Lupin off. One hand was still clawing the air as it tried to reach Scabbers, who was squealing like a piglet, scratching Ron's face and neck as he tried to escape.\n\u3000\u3000\"They've -- got -- a -- right -- to -- know -- -everything!\" Lupin panted, still trying to restrain Black. \"Ron's kept him as a pet! There are parts of it even I don't understand, and Harry -- you owe Harry the truth, Sirius!\"\n\u3000\u3000Black stopped struggling, though his hollowed eyes were still fixed on Scabbers, who was clamped tightly under Ron's bitten, scratched, ad bleeding hands.\n\u3000\u3000\"All right, then,\" Black said, without taking his eyes off the rat.\n\u3000\u3000\"Tell them whatever you like. But make it quick, Remus. I want to commit the murder I was imprisoned for...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You're nutters, both of you,\" said Ron shakily, looking round at Harry and Hermione for support. \"I've had enough of this. I'm off.\"\n\u3000\u3000He tried to heave himself up on his good leg, but Lupin raised his wand again, pointing it at Scabbers.\n\u3000\u3000\"You're going to hear me out, Ron,\" he said quietly. \"Just keep a tight hold on Peter while you listen.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"HE'S NOT PETER, HE'S SCABBERS!\" Ron yelled, trying to fore the rat back into his front pocket, but Scabbers was fighting to hard; Ron swayed and overbalanced, and Harry caught him am pushed him back down to the bed. Then, ignoring Black, Harry turned to Lupin.\n\u3000\u3000There were witnesses who saw Pettigrew die,\" he said. \"A whole street full of them...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"They didn't see what they thought they saw!\" said Black savagely, still watching Scabbers struggling in Ron's hands.\n\u3000\u3000\"Everyone thought Sirius killed Peter,\" said Lupin, nodding. \"I believed it myself -- until I saw the map tonight. Because the Marauder's map never lies... Peter's alive. Ron's holding him, Harry.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked down at Ron, and as their eyes met, they agreed, silently: Black and Lupin were both out of their minds. Their story made no sense whatsoever. How could Scabbers be Peter Pettigrew? Azkaban must have unhinged Black after all -- but why was Lupin playing along with him?\n\u3000\u3000Then Hermione spoke, in a trembling, would-be calm sort of voice, as though trying to will Professor Lupin to talk sensibly.\n\u3000\u3000\"But Professor Lupin... Scabbers can't be Pettigrew... it just can't be true, you know it can't...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Why can't it be true?\" Lupin said calmly, as though they were in class, and Hermione had simply spotted a problem in an experiment with grindylows.\n\u3000\u3000\"Because... because people would know if Peter Pettigrew had been an Animagus. We did Animagi in class with Professor McGonagall. And I looked them up when I did my homework -- the Ministry of Magic keeps tabs on witches and wizards who can become animals; there's a register showing what animal they become, and their markings and things... and I went and looked Professor McGonagall up on the register, and there have been only seven Animagi this century, and Pettigrew's name wasn't on the list.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry had barely had time to marvel inwardly at the effort Hermione put into her homework, when Lupin started to laugh.\n\u3000\u3000\"Light again, Hermione!\" he said. \"But the Ministry never knew that here used to be three unregistered Animagi running around Hogwarts.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I you're going to tell them the story, get a move on, Remus,\" said Black, who was still watching Scabbers's every desperate move. \"I've waited twelve years, I'm not going to wait much longer.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"All right... but you'll need to help me, Sirius,\" said Lupin, I only know how it began...\"\n\u3000\u3000Lupin broke off. There had been a loud creak behind him. The bedroom door had opened of its own accord. All five of them stared at it. Then Lupin strode toward it and looked out into the landing.\n\u3000\u3000\"No one there...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"This place is haunted!\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's not,\" said Lupin, still looking at the door in a puzzled way. \"The Shrieking Shack was never haunted.... The screams and howls the villagers used to hear were made by me.\"\n\u3000\u3000He pushed his graying hair out of his eyes, thought for a moment then said, \"That's where all of this starts -- with my becoming a werewolf, None of this could have happened if I hadn't been bitter... and if I hadn't been so foolhardy...\"\n\u3000\u3000He looked sober and tired. Ron started to interrupt, but Hermione, said, \"Shh!\" She was watching Lupin very intently.\n\u3000\u3000\"I as a very small boy when I received the bite. My parents tried everything, but in those days there was no cure. The potion that Professor Snape has been making for me is a very recent discovery. It makes me safe, you see. As long as I take it in the week, preceding the full moon, I keep my mind when I transform.... I'm able to curl up in my office, a harmless wolf, and wait for the moon to wane again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Before the Wolfsbane Potion was discovered, however, I became a fully fledged monster once a month. It seemed impossible that I would be able to come to Hogwarts. Other parents weren't likely to want their children exposed to me.\n\u3000\u3000\"But then Dumbledore became Headmaster, and he was sympathetic. He said that as long as we took certain precautions, there was no reason I shouldn't come to school....\" Lupin sighed, and looked directly at Harry. \"I told you, months ago, that the Whomping Willow was planted the year I came to Hogwarts. The truth is that it was planted because I came to Hogwarts. This house\" -- Lupin looked miserably around the room, -- \"the tunnel that leads to it -- they were built for my use. Once a month, I was smuggled out of the castle, into this place, to transform. The tree was placed at the tunnel mouth to stop anyone coming across me while I was dangerous.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry couldn't see where this story was going, but he was listening raptly all the same. The only sound apart from Lupin's voice was Scabbers's frightened squeaking.\n\u3000\u3000\"My transformations in those days were -- were terrible. It is very painful to turn into a werewolf. I was separated from humans to bite, so I bit and scratched myself instead. The villagers heard the noise and the screaming and thought they were hearing particularly violent spirits. Dumbledore encouraged the rumor.... Even now, when the house has been silent for years, the villagers don't dare approach it....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But apart from my transformations, I was happier than I had ever been in my life. For the first time ever, I had friends, three great friends. Sirius Black... Peter Pettigrew... and, of course, your father, Harry -- James Potter.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Now, my three friends could hardly fail to notice that I disappeared once a month. I made up all sorts of stories. I told them my mother was ill, and that I had to go home to see her... I was terrified they would desert me the moment they found out what I was. But of course, they, like you, Hermione, worked out the truth....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"And they didn't desert me at all. Instead, they did something for me that would make my transformations not only bearable, but the best times of my life. They became Animagi.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"My dad too?\" said Harry, astounded.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes, indeed,\" said Lupin. \"It took them the best part of three years to work out how to do it. Your father and Sirius here were the cleverest students in the school, and lucky they were, because the Animagus transformation can go horribly wrong -- one reason the Ministry keeps a close watch on those attempting to do it. Peter needed all the help he could get from James and Sirius. Finally, in our fifth year, they managed it. They could each turn into a different animal at will.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But how did that help you?\" said Hermione, sounding puzzled.\n\u3000\u3000\"They couldn't keep me company as humans, so they kept me company as animals,\" said Lupin. \"A werewolf is only a danger to people. They sneaked out of the castle every month under James's Invisibility Cloak. They transformed... Peter, as the smallest, could slip beneath the Willow's attacking branches and touch the knot that freezes it. They would then slip down the tunnel and join me. Under their influence, I became less dangerous. My body was still wolfish, but my mind seemed to become less so while I was with them.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hurry up, Remus,\" snarled Black, who was still watching Scabbers with a horrible sort of hunger on his face.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm getting there, Sirius, I'm getting there... well, highly exciting possibilities were open to us now that we could all transform. Soon we were leaving the Shrieking Shack and roaming the school grounds and the village by night. Sirius and James transformed into such large animals, they were able to keep a werewolf in check. I doubt whether any Hogwarts students ever found out more about the Hogwarts grounds and Hogsmeade than we did.... And that's how we came to write the Marauder's Map, and sign it with our nicknames. Sirius is Padfoot. Peter is Wormtail. James was Prongs.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What sort of animal --?\" Harry began, but Hermione cut him off.\n\u3000\u3000\"That was still really dangerous! Running around in the dark with a werewolf! What if you'd given the others the slip, and bitten somebody?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"A thought that still haunts me,\" said Lupin heavily. \"And there were near misses, many of them. We laughed about them afterwards. We were young, thoughtless -- carried away with our own cleverness.\"\n\u3000\u3000I sometimes felt guilty about betraying Dumbledore's trust, of course... he had admitted me to Hogwarts when no other headmaster would have done so, and he had no idea I was breaking the rules he had set down for my own and others' safety. He never knew I had led three fellow students into becoming Animagi illegally. But I always managed to forget my guilty feelings every time we sat down to plan our next month's adventure. And I haven't changed...\"\n\u3000\u3000Lupin's face had hardened, and there was self-disgust in his voice. \"All this year, I have been battling with myself, wondering whether I should tell Dumbledore that Sirius was an Animagus. But I didn't do it. Why? Because I was too cowardly. It would have meant admitting that I'd betrayed his trust while I was at school, admitting that I'd led others along with me... and Dumbledore's trust has meant everything to me. He let me into Hogwarts as a boy, and he gave me a job when I have been shunned all my adult life, unable to find paid work because of what I am. And so I convinced myself that Sirius was getting into the school using dark arts he learned from Voldemort, that being an Animagus had nothing to do with it... so, in a way, Snape's been right about me all along.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Snape?\" said Black harshly, taking his eyes off Scabbers; for the first time in minutes and looking up at Lupin. \"What's Snape got to do with it?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He's here, Sirius,\" said Lupin heavily. \"He's teaching here as well.\" He looked up at Harry, Ron, and Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor Snape was at school with us. He fought very hard against my appointment to the Defense Against the Dark Arts job. He has been telling Dumbledore A year that I am not to be trusted. He has his reasons... you see, Sirius here played a trick on him which nearly killed him, a trick which involved me --\"\n\u3000\u3000Black made a derisive noise.\n\u3000\u3000\"It served him right,\" he sneered. \"Sneaking around, trying to find out what we were up to... hoping he could get us expelled....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Severus was very interested in where I went every month.\" Lupin told Harry, Ron, and Hermione. \"We were in the same year, you know, and we -- er -- didn't like each other very much. He especially disliked James. Jealous, I think, of James's talent on the Quidditch field... anyway Snape had seen me crossing the grounds with Madam Pomfrey one evening as she led me toward the Whomping Willow to transform. Sirius thought it would be -- er -- amusing, to tell Snape all he had to do was prod the knot on the tree trunk with a long stick, and he'd be able to get in after me. Well, of course, Snape tried it -- if he'd got as far as this house, he'd have met a fully grown werewolf -- but your father, who'd heard what Sirius had done, went after Snape and pulled him back, at great risk to his life... Snape glimpsed me, though, at the end of the tunnel. He was forbidden by Dumbledore to tell anybody, but from that time on he knew what I was....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"So that's why Snape doesn't like you,\" said Harry slowly, \"because he thought you were in on the joke?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That's right,\" sneered a cold voice from the wall behind Lupin.\n\u3000\u3000Severus Snape was pulling off the Invisibility Cloak, his wand pointing, directly at Lupin.\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER NINETEEN\n\u3000\u3000THE SERVANT OF LORD VOLDEMORT\n\u3000\u3000Hermione screamed. Black leapt to his feet. Harry felt as though he'd received a huge electric shock.\n\u3000\u3000\"I found this at the base of the Whomping Willow,\" said Snape, throwing the cloak aside, careful to keep this wand pointing directly at Lupin's chest. \"Very useful, Potter, I thank you....\"\n\u3000\u3000Snape was slightly breathless, but his face was full of suppressed triumph. \"You're wondering, perhaps, how I knew you were here?\" he said, his eyes glittering. \"I've just been to your office, Lupin. You forgot to take your potion tonight, so I took a gobletful along. And very lucky I did... lucky for me, I mean. Lying on your desk was a certain map. One glance at it told me all I needed to know. I saw you running along this passageway and out of sight.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Severus --\" Lupin began, but Snape overrode him.\n\u3000\u3000\"I've told the headmaster again and again that you're helping your old friend Black into the castle, Lupin, and here's the proof. Not even I dreamed you would have the nerve to use this old place as your hideout --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Severus, you're making a mistake,\" said Lupin urgently. \"You haven't heard everything -- I can explain -- Sirius is not here to kill Harry --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Two more for Azkaban tonight,\" said Snape, his eyes now gleaming fanatically. \"I shall be interested to see how Dumbledore takes this.... He was quite convinced you were harmless, you know, Lupin... a tame werewolf --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You fool,\" said Lupin softly. \"Is a schoolboy grudge worth putting an innocent man back inside Azkaban?\"\n\u3000\u3000BANG! Thin, snakelike cords burst from the end of Snape's wand and twisted themselves around Lupin's mouth, wrists, and ankles; he overbalanced and fell to the floor, unable to move. With a roar of rage, Black started toward Snape, but Snape pointed his wand straight between Black's eyes.\n\u3000\u3000\"Give me a reason,\" he whispered. \"Give me a reason to do it, and I swear I will.\"\n\u3000\u3000Black stopped dead. It would have been impossible to say which face showed more hatred.\n\u3000\u3000Harry stood there, paralyzed, not knowing what to do or whom to believe. He glanced around at Ron and Hermione. Ron looked just as confused as he did, still fighting to keep hold on the struggling Scabbers. Hermione, however, took an uncertain step toward Snape and said, in a very breathless voice, \"Professor Snape -- it it wouldn't hurt to hear what they've got to say, w -- would it?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Miss Granger, you are already facing suspension from this school,\" Snape spat. \"You, Potter, and Weasley are out-of-bounds, in the company of a convicted murderer and a werewolf. For once in your life, hold your tongue.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But if -- if there was a mistake --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"KEEP QUIET, YOU STUPID GIRL!\" Snape shouted, looking suddenly quite deranged. \"DON'T TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!\" A few sparks shot out of the end of his wand, which was still pointed at Black's face. Hermione fell silent.\n\u3000\u3000\"Vengeance is very sweet,\" Snape breathed at Black. \"How I hoped I would be the one to catch you....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"The joke's on you again, Severus,\" Black snarled. \"As long as this boy brings his rat up to the castle\" -- he jerked his head at Ron -- \"I'll come quietly....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Up to the castle?\" said Snape silkily. \"I don't think we need to go that far. All I have to do is call the dementors once we get out of the Willow. They'll be very pleased to see you, Black... pleased enough to give you a little kiss, I daresay... I --\"\n\u3000\u3000What little color there was in Blacks face left it.\n\u3000\u3000\"You -you've got to hear me out,\" he croaked. \"The rat -- look at the rat --\"\n\u3000\u3000But there was a mad glint in Snape's eyes that Harry had never seen before. He seemed beyond reason.\n\u3000\u3000\"Come on, all of you,\" he said. He clicked his fingers, and the ends of the cords that bound Lupin flew to his hands. \"I'll drag the werewolf. Perhaps the dementors will have a kiss for him too --\"\n\u3000\u3000Before he knew what he was doing, Harry had crossed the room in three strides and blocked the door.\n\u3000\u3000\"Get out of the way, Potter, you're in enough trouble already,\" snarled Snape. \"If I hadn't been here to save your skin --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor Lupin could have killed me about a hundred times this year,\" Harry said. \"I've been alone with him loads of times, having defense lessons against the dementors. If he was helping Black, why didn't he just finish me off then?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't ask me to fathom the way a werewolf's mind works,\" hissed Snape. \"Get out of the way, Potter.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"YOURE PATHETIC!\" Harry yelled. \"JUST BECAUSE THEY MADE A FOOL OF YOU AT SCHOOL YOU WON'T EVEN LISTEN --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"SILENCE! I WILL NOT BE SPOKEN TO LIKE THAT!\" Snape shrieked, looking madder than ever. \"Like father, like son, Potter! I have just saved your neck; you should be thanking me on bended knee! You would have been well served if he'd killed you! You'd have died like your father, too arrogant to believe you might be mistaken in Black -- now get out of the way, or I will make you. GET OUT OF THE WAY, POTTER!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry made up his mind in a split second. Before Snape could take even one step toward him, he had raised his wand.\n\u3000\u3000\"Expelliarmus!\" he yelled -- except that his wasn't the only voice that shouted. There was a blast that made the door rattle on its hinges; Snape was lifted off his feet and slammed into the wall, then slid down it to the floor, a trickle of blood oozing from under his hair. He had been knocked out.\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked around. Both Ron and Hermione had tried to disarm Snape at exactly the same moment. Snape's wand soared in a high arc and landed on the bed next to Crookshanks.\n\u3000\u3000\"You shouldn't have done that,\" said Black, looking at Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"You should have left him to me....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry avoided Black's eyes. He wasn't sure, even now, that he'd done the right thing.\n\u3000\u3000\"We attacked a teacher... We attacked a teacher...\" Hermione whimpered, staring at the lifeless Snape with frightened eyes. \"Oh, we're going to be in so much trouble --\"\n\u3000\u3000Lupin was struggling against his bonds. Black bent down quickly and untied him. Lupin straightened up, rubbing his arms where the ropes had cut into them.\n\u3000\u3000\"Thank you, Harry,\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm still not saying I believe you,\" he told Lupin.\n\u3000\u3000\"Then it's time we offered you some proof,\" said Lupin. \"You, boy -- give me Peter, please. Now.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron clutched Scabbers closer to his chest.\n\u3000\u3000\"Come off it,\" he said weakly. \"Are you trying to say he broke out of Azkaban just to get his hands on Scabbers? I mean...\" He looked up at Harry and Hermione for support, \"Okay, say Pettigrew could turn into a rat -- there are millions of rats -- how's he supposed to know which one he's after if he was locked up in Azkaban?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You know, Sirius, that's a fair question,\" said Lupin, turning to Black and frowning slightly. \"How did you find out where he was?\"\n\u3000\u3000Black put one of his clawlike hands inside his robes and took out a crumpled piece of paper, which he smoothed flat and held out to show the others.\n\u3000\u3000It was the photograph of Ron and his family that had appeared in the Daily Prophet the previous summer, and there, on Ron's shoulder, was Scabbers.\n\u3000\u3000\"How did you get this?\" Lupin asked Black, thunderstruck.\n\u3000\u3000\"Fudge,\" said Black. \"When he came to inspect Azkaban last year, he gave me his paper. And there was Peter, on the front page on this boy's shoulder... I knew him at once... how many times had I seen him transform? And the caption said the boy would be going back to Hogwarts... to where Harry was...\n\u3000\u3000\"My God,\" said Lupin softly, staring from Scabbers to the picture in the paper and back again. \"His front paw...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What about it?\" said Ron defiantly.\n\u3000\u3000\"He's got a toe missing,\" said Black.\n\u3000\u3000\"Of course,\" Lupin breathed. \"So simple... so brilliant... he cut it off himself?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Just before he transformed,\" said Black. \"When I cornered him, he yelled for the whole street to hear that I'd betrayed Lily and James. Then, before I could curse him, he blew apart the street with the wand behind his back, killed everyone within twenty feet of himself -- and sped down into the sewer with the other rats....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Didn't you ever hear, Ron?\" said Lupin. \"The biggest bit of Peter they found was his finger.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Look, Scabbers probably had a fight with another rat or something! He's been in my family for ages, right --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Twelve years, in fact,\" said Lupin. \"Didn't you ever wonder why he was living so long?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We -- we've been taking good care of him!\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Not looking too good at the moment, though, is he?\" said Lupin. \"I'd guess he's been losing weight ever since he heard Sirius was on the loose again....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He's been scared of that mad cat!\" said Ron, nodding toward Crookshanks, who was still purring on the bed.\n\u3000\u3000But that wasn't right, Harry thought suddenly... Scabbers had been looking ill before he met Crookshanks... ever since Ron's return from Egypt... since the time when Black had escaped....\n\u3000\u3000\"This cat isn't mad,\" said Black hoarsely. He reached out a bony hand and stroked Crookshanks's fluffy head. \"He's the most intelligent of his kind I've ever met. He recognized Peter for what he was right away. And when he met me, he knew I was no dog. It was a while before he trusted me.... Finally, I managed to communicate to him what I was after, and he's been helping me. .. \"What do you mean?\" breathed Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"He tried to bring Peter to me, but couldn't... so he stole the passwords into Gryffindor Tower for me.... As I understand it, he took them from a boy's bedside table....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry's brain seemed to be sagging under the weight of what he was hearing. It was absurd... and yet...\n\u3000\u3000\"But Peter got wind of what was going on and ran for it.\" croaked Black. \"This cat -- Crookshanks, did you call him? -- told me Peter had left blood on the sheets.... I supposed he bit himself... Well, faking his own death had worked once.\"\n\u3000\u3000These words jolted Harry to his senses.\n\u3000\u3000\"And why did he fake his death?\" he said furiously. \"Because he knew you were about to kill him like you killed my parents!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Lupin, \"Harry-\"\n\u3000\u3000\"And now you've come to finish him off!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes, I have,\" said Black, with an evil look at Scabbers.\n\u3000\u3000\"Then I should've let Snape take you!\" Harry shouted.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry,\" said Lupin hurriedly, \"don't you see? All this time we've thought Sirius betrayed your parents, and Peter tracked him down -- but it was the other way around, don't you see? Peter betrayed your mother and father -- Sirius tracked Peter down --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"THAT'S NOT TRUE!\" Harry yelled. \"HE WAS THEIR SECRET-KEEPER! HE SAID SO BEFORE YOU TURNED UP. HE SAID HE KILLED THEM!\"\n\u3000\u3000He was pointing at Black, who shook his head slowly; the sunken eyes were suddenly over bright.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry... I as good as killed them,\" he croaked. \"I persuaded Lily and James to change to Peter at the last moment, persuaded them to use him as Secret-Keeper instead of me.... I'm to blame, I know it.... The night they died, I'd arranged to check on Peter, make sure he was still safe, but when I arrived at his hiding place, he'd gone. Yet there was no sign of a struggle. It didn't feel right. I was scared. I set out for your parents' house straight away. And when I saw their house, destroyed, and their bodies... I realized what Peter must've done... what I'd done....\"\n\u3000\u3000His voice broke. He turned away.\n\u3000\u3000\"Enough of this,\" said Lupin, and there was a steely note in his voice Harry had never heard before. \"There's one certain way to prove what really happened. Ron, give me that rat.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What are you going to do with him if I give him to you?\" Ron asked Lupin tensely.\n\u3000\u3000\"Force him to show himself,\" said Lupin. \"If he really is a rat, it won't hurt him.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron hesitated. Then at long last, he held out Scabbers and Lupin took him. Scabbers began to squeak without stopping, twisting and turning, his tiny black eyes bulging in his head. \"Ready, Sirius?\" said Lupin.\n\u3000\u3000Black had already retrieved Snape's wand from the bed. He approached Lupin and the struggling rat, and his wet eyes suddenly seemed to be burning in his face.\n\u3000\u3000\"Together?\" he said quietly.\n\u3000\u3000\"I think so,,, said Lupin, holding Scabbers tightly in one hand and his wand in the other. \"On the count of three. One -- two -- THREE!\"\n\u3000\u3000A flash of blue-white light erupted from both wands; for a moment, Scabbers was frozen in midair, his small gray form twisting madly -- Ron yelled -- the rat fell and hit the floor. There was another blinding flash of light and then --\n\u3000\u3000It was like watching a speeded-up film of a growing tree. A head was shooting upward from the ground; limbs were sprouting; a moment later, a man was standing where Scabbers had been, cringing and wringing his hands. Crookshanks was spitting and snarling on the bed; the hair on his back was standing up.\n\u3000\u3000He was a very short man, hardly taller than Harry and Hermione. His thin, colorless hair was unkempt and there was a large bald patch on top. He had the shrunken appearance of a plump man who has lost a lot of weight in a short time. His skin looked grubby, almost like Scabbers's fur, and something of the rat lingered around his pointed nose and his very small, watery eyes. He looked around at them all, his breathing fast and shallow. Harry saw his eyes dart to the door and back again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, hello, Peter,\" said Lupin pleasantly, as though rats frequently erupted into old school friends around him. \"Long time, no see.\n\u3000\u3000\"S -- Sirius... R -- Remus...\" Even Pettigrew's voice was squeaky. Again, his eyes darted toward the door. \"My friends... my old friends...\"\n\u3000\u3000Black's wand arm rose, but Lupin seized him around the wrist, gave him a warning took, then turned again to Pettigrew, his voice light and casual.\n\u3000\u3000\"We've been having a little chat, Peter, about what happened the night Lily and James died. You might have missed the finer points while you were squeaking around down there on the bed --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Remus,\" gasped Pettigrew, and Harry could see beads of sweat breaking out over his pasty face, \"you don't believe him, do you...? He tried to kill me, Remus....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"So we've heard,\" said Lupin, more coldly. \"I'd like to clear up one or two little matters with you, Peter, if you'll be so --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He's come to try and kill me again!\" Pettigrew squeaked suddenly, pointing at Black, and Harry saw that he used his middle finger, because his index was missing. \"He killed Lily and James and now he's going to kill me too.... You've got to help me, Remus....\"\n\u3000\u3000Black's face looked more skull-like than ever as he stared at Pettigrew with his fathomless eyes.\n\u3000\u3000\"No one's going to try and kill you until we've sorted a few things out,\" said Lupin.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sorted things out?\" squealed Pettigrew, looking wildly about him once more, eyes taking in the boarded windows and, again' the only door. \"I knew he'd come after me! I knew he'd be back for me! I've been waiting for this for twelve years!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You knew Sirius was going to break out of Azkaban?\" said Lupin, his brow furrowed. \"When nobody has ever done it before?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He's got dark powers the rest of us can only dream of!\" Pettigrew shouted shrilly. \"How else did he get out of there? I suppose He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named taught him a few tricks!\"\n\u3000\u3000Black started to laugh, a horrible, mirthless laugh that filled the whole room.\n\u3000\u3000\"Voldemort, teach me tricks?\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000Pettigrew flinched as though Black had brandished a whip at him.\n\u3000\u3000\"What, scared to hear your old master's name?\" said Black. I don't blame you, Peter. His lot aren't very happy with you, are they?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't know what you mean, Sirius --\" muttered Pettigrew, his breathing faster than ever. His whole face was shining with sweat now.\n\u3000\u3000\"You haven't been hiding from me for twelve years,\" said Black. \"You've been hiding from Voldemort's old supporters. I heard things in Azkaban, Peter... They all think you're dead, or you'd have to answer to them.... I've heard them screaming all sorts of things in their sleep. Sounds like they think the double-crosser double-crossed them. Voldemort went to the Potters' on your information... and Voldemort met his downfall there. And not all Voldemort's supporters ended up in Azkaban, did they? There are still plenty out here, biding their time, pretending they've seen the error of their ways.\n\u3000\u3000If they ever got wind that you were still alive, Peter --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't know... what you're talking about...,\" said Pettigrew again, more shrilly than ever. He wiped his face on his sleeve and looked up at Lupin. \"You don't believe this -- this madness, Remus --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I must admit, Peter, I have difficulty in understanding why an innocent man would want to spend twelve years as a rat,\" said Lupin evenly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Innocent, but scared!\" squealed Pettigrew. \"If Voldemort's supporters were after me, it was because I put one of their best men in Azkaban -- the spy, Sirius Black!\"\n\u3000\u3000Black's face contorted.\n\u3000\u3000\"How dare you,\" he growled, sounding suddenly like the bearsized dog he had been. I, a spy for Voldemort? When did I ever sneak around people who were stronger and more powerful than myself? But you, Peter -- I'll never understand why I didn't see you were the spy from the start. You always liked big friends who'd look after you, didn't you? It used to be us... me and Remus... and James....\n\u3000\u3000Pettigrew wiped his face again; he was almost panting for breath.\n\u3000\u3000\"Me, a spy... must be out of your mind... never... don't know how you can say such a --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Lily and James only made you Secret-Keeper because I suggested it,\" Black hissed, so venomously that Pettigrew took a step backward. \"I thought it was the perfect plan... a bluff... Voldemort would be sure to come after me, would never dream they'd use a weak, talentless thing like you.... It must have been the finest moment of your miserable life, telling Voldemort you could hand him the Potters.\"\n\u3000\u3000Pettigrew was muttering distractedly; Harry caught words like \"far-fetched\" and \"lunacy,\" but he couldn't help paying more attention to the ashen color of Pettigrew's face and the way his eyes continued to dart toward the windows and door.\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor Lupin?\" said Hermione timidly. \"Can -- can I say something?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Certainly, Hermione,\" said Lupin courteously.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well -- Scabbers -- I mean, this -- this man -- he's been sleeping in Harry's dormitory for three years. If he's working for You-Know-Who, how come he never tried to hurt Harry before now?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"There!\" said Pettigrew shrilly, pointing at Ron with his maimed hand. \"Thank you! You see, Remus? I have never hurt a hair of Harry's head! Why should I?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll tell you why,\" said Black. \"Because you never did anything for anyone unless you could see what was in it for you. Voldemort's been in hiding for fifteen years, they say he's half dead. You weren't about to commit murder right under Albus Dumbledore's nose, for a wreck of a wizard who'd lost all of his power, were you? You'd want to be quite sure he was the biggest bully in the playground before you went back to him, wouldn't you? Why else did you find a wizard family to take you in? Keeping an ear out for news, weren't YOU, Peter? Just in case your old protector regained strength, and it was safe to rejoin him....\"\n\u3000\u3000Pettigrew opened his mouth and closed it several times. He seemed to have lost the ability to talk.\n\u3000\u3000\"Er -- Mr. Black -- Sirius?\" said Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000Black jumped at being addressed like this and stared at Hermione as though he had never seen anything quite like her.\n\u3000\u3000\"If you don't mind me asking, how -- how did you get out of Azkaban, if you didn't use Dark Magic?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Thank you!\" gasped Pettigrew, nodding frantically at her. \"Exactly! Precisely what I --\"\n\u3000\u3000But Lupin silenced him with a look. Black was frowning slightly at Hermione, but not as though he were annoyed with her. He seemed to be pondering his answer.\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't know how I did it,\" he said slowly. \"I think the only reason I never lost my mind is that I knew I was innocent. That wasn't a happy thought, so the dementors couldn't suck it out of me... but it kept me sane and knowing who I am... helped me keep my powers... so when it all became ... too much... I could transform in my cell... become a dog. Dementors can't see, you know....\" He swallowed. \"They feel their way toward people by feeding off their emotions.... They could tell that my feelings were less -- less human, less complex when I was a dog... but they thought, of course, that I was losing my mind like everyone else in there, so it didn't trouble them. But I was weak, very weak, and I had no hope of driving them away from me without a wand....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But then I saw Peter in that picture... I realized he was at Hogwarts with Harry... perfectly positioned to act, if one hint reached his ears that the Dark Side was gathering strength again....\"\n\u3000\u3000Pettigrew was shaking his head, mouthing noiselessly, but staring all the while at Black as though hypnotized.\n\u3000\u3000\"... ready to strike at the moment he could be sure of allies... and to deliver the last Potter to them. if he gave them Harry, who'd dare say he'd betrayed Lord Voldemort? He'd be welcomed back with honors....\n\u3000\u3000\"So you see, I had to do something. I was the only one who knew Peter was still alive....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry remembered what Mr. Weasley had told Mrs. Wealsey. \"The guards say he's been talking in his sleep... always the same words... 'He's at Hogwarts.'\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It was as if someone had lit a fire In my head, and the dementors couldn't destroy it.... It wasn't a happy feeling... it was an obsession... but it gave me strength, it cleared my mind. So, one night when they opened my door to bring food, I slipped past them as a dog.... It's so much harder for them to sense animal emotions that they were confused.... I was thin, very thin... thin enough to slip through the bars.... I swam as a dog back to the mainland.... I journeyed north and slipped into the Hogwarts grounds as a dog. I've been living in the forest ever since, except when I came to watch the Quidditch, of course. You fly as well as your father did, Harry....\"\n\u3000\u3000He looked at Harry, who did not look away.\n\u3000\u3000\"Believe me,\" croaked Black. \"Believe me, Harry. I never betrayed James and Lily. I would have died before I betrayed them.\"\n\u3000\u3000And at long last, Harry believed him. Throat too tight to speak, he nodded.\n\u3000\u3000\"No!\"\n\u3000\u3000Pettigrew had fallen to his knees as though Harry's nod had been his own death sentence. He shuffled forward on his knees, groveling, his hands clasped in front of him as though praying.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sirius -- it's me... it's Peter... your friend... you wouldn't --\"\n\u3000\u3000Black kicked out and Pettigrew recoiled.\n\u3000\u3000\"There's enough filth on my robes without you touching them,\" said Black.\n\u3000\u3000\"Remus!\" Pettigrew squeaked, turning to Lupin instead, writhing imploringly in front of him. \"You don't believe this wouldn't Sirius have told you they'd changed the plan?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Not if he thought I was the spy, Peter,\" said Lupin. \"I assume that's why you didn't tell me, Sirius?\" he said casually over Pettigrews head.\n\u3000\u3000\"Forgive me, Remus,\" said Black.\n\u3000\u3000\"Not at all, Padfoot, old friend,\" said Lupin, who was now rolling up his sleeves. \"And will you, in turn, forgive me for believing you were the spy?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Of course,\" said Black, and the ghost of a grin flitted across his gaunt face. He, too, began rolling up his sleeves. \"Shall we kill him together?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes, I think so,\" said Lupin grimly.\n\u3000\u3000\"You wouldn't... you won't...,\" gasped Pettigrew. And he scrambled around to Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron... haven't I been a good friend... a good pet? You won't let them kill me, Ron, will you... you're on my side, aren't you.\n\u3000\u3000But Ron was staring at Pettigrew with the utmost revulsion.\n\u3000\u3000\"I let you sleep in my bed!\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000\"Kind boy... kind master...\" Pettigrew crawled toward Ron \"You won't let them do it.... I was your rat.... I was a good pet....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"If you made a better rat than a human, it's not much to boast about, Peter,\" said Black harshly. Ron, going still paler with pain, wrenched his broken leg out of Pettigrew's reach. Pettigrew turned on his knees, staggered forward, and seized the hem of Hermione's robes.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sweet girl... clever girl... you -- you won't let them.... Help me....\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione pulled her robes out of Pettigrew's clutching hands and backed away against the wall, looking horrified.\n\u3000\u3000Pettigrew knelt, trembling uncontrollably, and-turned his head slowly toward Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry... Harry... you look just like your father... just like him....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO HARRY?\" roared Black. \"HOW DARE YOU FACE HIM? HOW DARE YOU TALK ABOUT JAMES IN FRONT OF HIM?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry,\" whispered Pettigrew, shuffling toward him, hands outstretched. \"Harry, James wouldn't have wanted me killed.... James would have understood, Harry... he would have shown me mercy...\"\n\u3000\u3000Both Black and Lupin strode forward, seized Pettigrew's shoulders, and threw him backward onto the floor. He sat there, twitching with terror, staring up at them.\n\u3000\u3000\"You sold Lily and James to Voldemort,\" said Black, who was shaking too. \"Do you deny it?\"\n\u3000\u3000Pettigrew burst into tears. It was horrible to watch, like an oversized, balding baby, cowering on the floor.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sirius, Sirius, what could I have done? The Dark Lord... you have no idea... he has weapons you can't imagine.... I was scared, Sirius, I was never brave like you and Remus and James. I never meant it to happen.... He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named forced me --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"DON'T LIE!\" bellowed Black. \"YOU'D BEEN PASSING INFORMATION TO HIM FOR A YEAR BEFORE LILY AND JAMES DIED! YOU WERE HIS SPY!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He -- he was taking over everywhere!\" gasped Pettigrew. \"Wh -- what was there to be gained by refusing him?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What was there to be gained by fighting the most evil wizard who has ever existed?\" said Black, with a terrible fury in his face. \"Only innocent lives, Peter!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You don't understand!\" whined Pettigrew. \"He would have killed me, Sirius!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE DIED!\" roared Black. \"DIED RATHER THAN BETRAY YOUR FRIENDS, AS WE WOULD HAVE DONE FOR YOU!\"\n\u3000\u3000Black and Lupin stood shoulder to shoulder, wands raised.\n\u3000\u3000\"You should have realized,\" said Lupin quietly, \"if Voldemort didn't kill you, we would. Good-bye, Peter.\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione covered her face with her hands and turned to the wall.\n\u3000\u3000\"NO!\" Harry yelled. He ran forward, placing himself in front Pettigrew, facing the wands. \"You can't kill him,\" he said breathlessly. \"You can't.\"\n\u3000\u3000Black and Lupin both looked staggered.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, this piece of vermin is the reason you have no parents,\" Black snarled. \"This cringing bit of filth would have seen you die too, without turning a hair. You heard him. His own stinking skin meant more to him than your whole family.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I know,\" Harry panted. \"We'll take him up to the castle. We'll hand him over to the dementors.... He can go to Azkaban... but don't kill him.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry!\" gasped Pettigrew, and he flung his arms around Harry's knees. \"You -- thank you -- it's more than I deserve -- thank you --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Get off me,\" Harry spat, throwing Pettigrew's hands off him in disgust. \"I'm not doing this for you. I'm doing it because -- I don't reckon my dad would've wanted them to become killers -- just for you.\"\n\u3000\u3000No one moved or made a sound except Pettigrew, whose breath was coming in wheezes as he clutched his chest. Black and Lupin were looking at each other. Then, with one movement, they lowered their wands.\n\u3000\u3000\"You're the only person who has the right to decide, Harry,\" said Black. \"But think... think what he did....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He can go to Azkaban,\" Harry repeated. \"If anyone deserves that place, he does....\"\n\u3000\u3000Pettigrew was still wheezing behind him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Very well,\" said Lupin. \"Stand aside, Harry.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry hesitated.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm going to tie him up,\" said Lupin. \"That's all, I swear.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry stepped out of the way. Thin cords shot from Lupin's wand this time, and next moment, Pettigrew was wriggling on the floor, bound and gagged.\n\u3000\u3000\"But if you transform, Peter,\" growled Black, his own wand pointing at Pettigrew too, \"we will kill you. You agree, Harry?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked down at the pitiful figure on the floor and nodded so that Pettigrew could see him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Right,\" said Lupin, suddenly businesslike. \"Ron, I can't mend bones nearly as well as Madam Pomfrey, so I think it's best if we just strap your leg up until we can get you to the hospital wing.\"\n\u3000\u3000He hurried over to Ron, bent down, tapped Ron's leg with his wand, and muttered, \"Ferula.\" Bandages spun up Ron's leg, strapping it tightly to a splint. Lupin helped him to his feet; Ron put his weight gingerly on the leg and didn't wince.\n\u3000\u3000\"That's better,\" he said. \"Thanks.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What about Professor Snape?\" said Hermione in a small voice, looking down at Snape's prone figure.\n\u3000\u3000\"There's nothing seriously wrong with him,\" said Lupin, bending over Snape and checking his pulse. \"You were just a little -- overenthusiastic. Still out cold. Er -- perhaps it will be best if we don't revive him until we're safety back in the castle. We can take him like this....\"\n\u3000\u3000He muttered, \"Mobilicorpus.\" As though invisible strings were tied to Snape's wrists, neck, and knees, he was pulled into a standing position, head still lolling unpleasantly, like a grotesque puppet. He hung a few inches above the ground, his limp feet dangling. Lupin picked up the Invisibility Cloak and tucked it safely into his pocket.\n\u3000\u3000\"And two of us should be chained to this,\" said Black, nudging Pettigrew with his toe. \"Just to make sure.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll do it,\" said Lupin.\n\u3000\u3000\"And me,\" said Ron savagely, limping forward.\n\u3000\u3000Black conjured heavy manacles from thin air; soon Pettigrew was upright again, left arm chained to Lupin's right, right arm to Ron's left. Ron's face was set. He seemed to have taken Scabbers's true identity as a personal insult. Crookshanks leapt lightly off the bed and led the way out of the room, his bottlebrush tail held jauntily high.\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER TWENTY\n\u3000\u3000THE DEMENTOR'S KISS\n\u3000\u3000Harry had never been part of a stranger group. Crookshanks led the way down the stairs; Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron went next, looking like entrants in a six-legged race. Next came Professor Snape, drifting creepily along, his toes hitting each stair as they descended, held up by his own wand, which was being pointed at him by Sirius. Harry and Hermione brought up the rear.\n\u3000\u3000Getting back into the tunnel was difficult. Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron had to turn sideways to manage it; Lupin still had Pettigrew covered with his wand. Harry could see them edging awkwardly along the tunnel in single file. Crookshanks was still in the lead. Harry went right after Black, who was still making Snape drift along ahead of them; he kept bumping his lolling head on the low ceiling. Harry had the impression Black was making no effort to prevent this.\n\u3000\u3000\"You know what this means?\" Black said abruptly to Harry as they made their slow progress along the tunnel. \"Turning Pettigrew in?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You' re free,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes...,\" said Black. \"But I'm also -- I don't know if anyone ever told you -- I'm your godfather.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, I knew that,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well... your parents appointed me your guardian,\" said Black stiffly. \"If anything happened to them...\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry waited. Did Black mean what he thought he meant?\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll understand, of course, if you want to stay with your aunt and uncle,\" said Black. \"But... well... think about it. Once my name's cleared... if you wanted a... a different home...\"\n\u3000\u3000Some sort of explosion took place in the pit of Harry's stomach.\n\u3000\u3000\"What -- live with you?\" he said, accidentally cracking his head on a bit of rock protruding from the ceiling. \"Leave the Dursleys?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Of course, I thought you wouldn't want to,\" said Black quickly. \"I understand, I just thought I'd --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Are you insane?\" said Harry, his voice easily as croaky as Black's.\n\u3000\u3000\"Of course I want to leave the Dursleys! Have you got a house? When can I move in?\"\n\u3000\u3000Black turned right around to look at him; Snape's head was scraping the ceiling but Black didn't seem to care.\n\u3000\u3000\"You want to?\" he said. \"You mean it?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, I mean it!\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000Black's gaunt face broke into the first true smile Harry had seen upon it. The difference it made was startling, as though a person ten years younger were shining through the starved mask; for a moment, he was recognizable as the man who had laughed at Harry's parents' wedding.\n\u3000\u3000They did not speak again until they had reached the end of the tunnel. Crookshanks darted up first; he had evidently pressed his paw to the knot on the trunk, because Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron clambered upward without any sound of savaging branches.\n\u3000\u3000Black saw Snape up through the hole, then stood back for Harry and Hermione to pass. At last, all of them were out.\n\u3000\u3000The grounds were very dark now; the only light came from the distant windows of the castle. Without a word, they set off. Pettigrew was still wheezing and occasionally whimpering. Harry's mind was buzzing. He was going to leave the Dursleys. He was going to live with Sirius Black, his parents' best friend.... He felt dazed.... What would happen when he told the Dursleys he was going to live with the convict they'd seen on television... !\n\u3000\u3000\"One wrong move, Peter,\" said Lupin threateningly ahead. His wand was still pointed sideways at Pettigrew's chest.\n\u3000\u3000Silently they tramped through the grounds, the castle lights growing slowly larger. Snape was still drifting weirdly ahead of Black, his chin bumping on his chest. And then -\n\u3000\u3000A cloud shifted. There were suddenly dim shadows on the ground. Their party was bathed in moonlight.\n\u3000\u3000Snape collided with Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron, who had stopped abruptly. Black froze. He flung out one arm to make Harry and Hermione stop.\n\u3000\u3000Harry could see Lupin's silhouette. He had gone rigid. Then his limbs began to shake.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, my --\" Hermione gasped. \"He didn't take his potion tonight! He's not safe!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Run,\" Black whispered. \"Run. Now.\"\n\u3000\u3000But Harry couldn't run. Ron was chained to Pettigrew and Lupin. He leapt forward but Black caught him around the chest and threw him back.\n\u3000\u3000\"Leave it to me -- RUN!\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a terrible snarling noise. Lupin's head was lengthening. So was his body. His shoulders were hunching. Hair was sprouting visibly on his face and hands, which were curling into clawed paws. Crookshanks's hair was on end again; he was backing away --\n\u3000\u3000As the werewolf reared, snapping its long jaws, Sirius disappeared from Harry's side. He had transformed. The enormous, bearlike dog bounded forward. As the werewolf wrenched itself free of the manacle binding it, the dog seized it about the neck and pulled it backward, away from Ron and Pettigrew. They were locked, jaw to jaw, claws ripping at each other.\n\u3000\u3000Harry stood, transfixed by the sight, too intent upon the battle to notice anything else. It was Hermione's scream that alerted him --\n\u3000\u3000Pettigrew had dived for Lupin's dropped wand. Ron, unsteady on his bandaged leg, fell. There was a bang, a burst of light -- and Ron lay motionless on the ground. Another bang -- Crookshanks flew into the air and back to the earth in a heap.\n\u3000\u3000\"Expelliarmus.\" Harry yelled, pointing his own wand at Pettigrew; Lupin's wand flew high into the air and out of sight. \"Stay where you are!\" Harry shouted, running forward.\n\u3000\u3000Too late. Pettigrew had transformed. Harry saw his bald tail whip through the manacle on Ron's outstretched arm and heard a scurrying through the grass.\n\u3000\u3000There was a howl and a rumbling growl; Harry turned to see the werewolf taking flight; it was galloping into the forest --\n\u3000\u3000\"Sirius, he's gone, Pettigrew transformed!\" Harry yelled.\n\u3000\u3000Black was bleeding; there were gashes across his muzzle and back, but at Harry's words he scrambled up again, and in an instant, the sound of his paws faded to silence as he pounded away across the grounds.\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Hermione dashed over to Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"What did he do to him?\" Hermione whispered. Ron's eyes were only half-closed, his mouth hung open; he was definitely alive, they could hear him breathing, but he didn't seem to recognize them.\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't know....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked desperately around. Black and Lupin both gone... they had no one but Snape for company, still hanging, unconscious, in midair.\n\u3000\u3000\"We'd better get them up to the castle and tell someone,\" said Harry, pushing his hair out of his eyes, trying to think straight. \"Come --\"\n\u3000\u3000But then, from beyond the range of their vision, they heard a yelping, a whining: a dog in pain....\n\u3000\u3000\"Sirius,\" Harry muttered, staring into the darkness.\n\u3000\u3000He had a moment's indecision, but there was nothing they could do for Ron at the moment, and by the sound of it, Black was in trouble --\n\u3000\u3000Harry set off at a run, Hermione right behind him. The yelping seemed to be coming from the ground near the edge of the lake. They pelted toward it, and Harry, running flat out, felt the cold without realizing what it must mean -\n\u3000\u3000The yelping stopped abruptly. As they reached the lakeshore, they saw why -- Sirius had turned back into a man. He was crouched on all fours, his hands over his head.\n\u3000\u3000'Nooo,\" he moaned. 'Nooo... please....\"\n\u3000\u3000And then Harry saw them. Dementors, at least a hundred of them, gliding in a black mass around the lake toward them. He spun around, the familiar, icy cold penetrating his insides, fog starting to obscure his vision; more were appearing out of the darkness on every side; they were encircling them....\n\u3000\u3000\"Herrnione, think of something happy!\" Harry yelled, raising his wand, blinking furiously to try and clear his vision, shaking his head to rid it of the faint screaming that had started inside it --\n\u3000\u3000I'm going to live with my godfather. I'm leaving the Dursleys.\n\u3000\u3000He forced himself to think of Black, and only Black, and began to chant: \"Expecto patronum! Expecto patronum!\"\n\u3000\u3000Black gave a shudder, rolled over, and lay motionless on the ground, pale as death.\n\u3000\u3000He'll be all right. I'm going to go and live with him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Expecto patronum! Hermione, help me! Expecto patronum!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Expecto --\" Hermione whispered, \"expecto -- expecto --\"\n\u3000\u3000But she couldn't do it. The dementors were closing in, barely ten feet from them. They formed a solid wall around Harry and Hermione, and were getting closer....\n\u3000\u3000\"EXPECTO PATRONUM!\" Harry yelled, trying to blot the screaming from his ears. \"EXPECTO PATRONUM!\"\n\u3000\u3000A thin wisp of silver escaped his wand and hovered like mist before him. At the same moment, Harry felt Hermione collapse next to him. He was alone... completely alone....\n\u3000\u3000\"Expecto -- expecto patronum --\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry felt his knees hit the cold grass. Fog was clouding his eyes. With a huge effort, he fought to remember -- Sirius was innocent -- innocent -- We'll be okay -- I' mgoing to live with him --\n\u3000\u3000\"Ex ecto patronum!\" he gasped.\n\u3000\u3000By the feeble light of his formless Patronus, He saw a dementor halt, very close to him. It couldn't walk through the cloud of silver mist Harry had conjured. A dead, slimy hand slid out from under the cloak. It made a gesture as though to sweep the Patronus aside.\n\u3000\u3000\"No -- no --\" Harry gasped. \"He's innocent... expecto expecto patronum --\"\n\u3000\u3000He could feet them watching him, hear their rattling breath like an evil wind around him. The nearest dementor seemed to be considering him. Then it raised both its rotting hands -- and lowered its hood.\n\u3000\u3000Where there should have been eyes, there was only thin, gray scabbed skin, stretched blankly over empty sockets. But there was a mouth... a gaping, shapeless hole, sucking the air with the sound of a death rattle.\n\u3000\u3000A paralyzing terror filled Harry so that he couldn't move or speak. His Patronus flickered and died.\n\u3000\u3000White fog was blinding him. He had to fight... expecto patronum ... he couldn't see... and in the distance, he heard the familiar screaming... expecto patronum... he groped in the mist for Sirius, and found his arm... they weren't going to take him....\n\u3000\u3000But a pair of strong, clammy hands suddenly attached themselves around Harry's neck. They were forcing his face upward.... He could feel its breath.... It was going to get rid of him first.... He could feel its putrid breath.... His mother was screaming in his ears.... She was going to be the last thing he ever heard --\n\u3000\u3000And then, through the fog that was drowning him, he thought he saw a silvery light growing brighter and brighter... He felt himself fall forward onto the grass.... Facedown, too weak to move, sick and shaking, Harry opened his eyes. The dementor must have released him. The blinding light was illuminating the grass around him.... The screaming had stopped, the cold was ebbing away...\n\u3000\u3000Something was driving the dementors back.... It was circling around him and Black and Hermione.... They were leaving....\n\u3000\u3000The air was warm again....\n\u3000\u3000With every ounce of strength he could muster, Harry raised his head a few inches and saw an animal amid the light, galloping away across the lake.... Eyes blurred with sweat, Harry tried to make out what it was.... It was as bright as a unicorn.... Fighting to stay conscious, Harry watched it canter to a halt as it reached the opposite shore. For a moment, Harry saw, by its brightness, somebody welcoming it back... raising his hand to pat it... someone who looked strangely familiar ... but it couldn't be...\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't understand. He couldn't think anymore. He felt the last of his strength leave him, and his head hit the ground as he fainted.\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE\n\u3000\u3000HERMIONE'S SECRET\n\u3000\u3000Shocking business... shocking... miracle none of them died... never heard the like... by thunder, it was lucky you were there, Snape....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Thank you, Minister.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Order of Merlin, Second Class, I'd say. First Class, if I can wangle it!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Thank you very much indeed, Minister.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Nasty cut you've got there.... Black's work, I suppose?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"As a matter of fact, it was Potter, Weasley, and Granger, Minister....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Black had bewitched them, I saw it immediately. A Confundus Charm, to judge by their behavior. They seemed to think there was a possibility he was innocent. They weren't responsible for their actions. On the other hand, their interference might have permitted Black to escape.... They obviously thought they were going to catch Black single-handed. They've got away with a great deal before now... I'm afraid it's given them a rather high opinion of themselves... and of course Potter has always been allowed an extraordinary amount of license by the headmaster --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah, well, Snape... Harry Potter, you know... we've all got a bit of a blind spot where he's concerned.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"And yet -- is it good for him to be given so much special treatment? Personally, I try and treat him like any other student. And any other student would be suspended -- at the very least -- for leading his friends into such danger. Consider, Minister -- against all school rules -- after all the precautions put in place for his protection -- out-of-bounds, at night, consorting with a werewolf and a murderer -- and I have reason to believe he has been visiting Hogsmeade illegally too --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, well... we shall see, Snape, we shall see.... The boy has undoubtedly been foolish....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry lay listening with his eyes tight shut. He felt very groggy. The words he was hearing seemed to be traveling very slowly from his ears to his brain, so that it was difficult to understand.... His limbs felt like lead; his eyelids too heavy to lift.... He wanted to lie here, on this comfortable bed, forever....\n\u3000\u3000\"What amazes me most is the behavior of the dementors... you've really no idea what made them retreat, Snape?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No, Minister... by the time I had come 'round they were heading back to their positions at the entrances....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Extraordinary. And yet Black, and Harry, and the girl --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"All unconscious by the time I reached them. I bound and gagged Black, naturally, conjured stretchers, and brought them all straight back to the castle.\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a pause. Harry's brain seemed to be moving a little faster, and as it did, a gnawing sensation grew in the pit of his stomach....\n\u3000\u3000He opened his eyes.\n\u3000\u3000Everything was slightly blurred. Somebody had removed his glasses. He was lying in the dark hospital wing. At the very end of the ward, he could make out Madam Pomfrey with her back to him, bending over a bed. Harry squinted. Ron's red hair was visible beneath Madam Pomfrey's arm.\n\u3000\u3000Harry moved his head over on the pillow. In the bed to his right lay Hermione. Moonlight was falling across her bed. Her eyes were open too. She looked petrified, and when she saw that Harry was awake, pressed a finger to her lips, then pointed to the hospital wing door. It was ajar, and the voices of Cornelius Fudge and Snape were coming through it from the corridor outside.\n\u3000\u3000Madam Pomfrey now came walking briskly up the dark ward to Harry's bed. He turned to took at her. She was carrying the largest block of chocolate he had ever seen in his life. It looked like a small boulder.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah, you're awake!\" she said briskly. She placed the chocolate on Harry's bedside table and began breaking it apart with a small hammer.\n\u3000\u3000\"How's Ron?\" said Harry and Hermione together.\n\u3000\u3000\"He'll live, said Madam Pomfrey grimly. \"As for you two you'll be staying here until I'm satisfied you're -- Potter, what do you think you're doing?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry was sitting up, putting his glasses back on, and picking up his wand.\n\u3000\u3000\"I need to see the headmaster,\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000\"Potter,\" said Madam Pomfrey soothingly, \"it's all right. They've got Black. He's locked away upstairs. The dementors will be performing the kiss any moment now --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"WHAT?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry jumped up out of bed; Hermione had done the same. But his shout had been heard in the corridor outside; next second, Cornelius Fudge and Snape had entered the ward.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, Harry, what's this?\" said Fudge, looking agitated. \"You should be in bed -- has he had any chocolate?\" he asked Madam Pomfrey anxiously.\n\u3000\u3000\"Minister, listen!\" Harry said. \"Sirius Black's innocent! Peter Pettigrew faked his own death! We saw him tonight! You can't let the dementors do that thing to Sirius, he's --\"\n\u3000\u3000But Fudge was shaking his head with a small smile on his face.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, Harry, you're very confused, you've been through a dreadful ordeal, lie back down, now, we've got everything under control....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"YOU HAVEN'T!\" Harry yelled. \"YOUVE GOT THE WRONG MAN!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Minister, listen, please,\" Hermione said; she had hurried to Harry's side and was gazing imploringly into Fudge's face. \"I saw him too. It was Ron's rat, he's an Animagus, Pettigrew, I mean, and --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You see, Minister?\" said Snape. \"Confunded, both of them.... Black's done a very good job on them....\" \"WE'RE NOT CONFUNDED!\" Harry roared.\n\u3000\u3000\"Minister! Professor!\" said Madam Pomfrey angrily. \"I must insist that you leave. Potter is my patient, and he should not be distressed!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm not distressed, I'm trying to tell them what happened!\" Harry said furiously. \"If they'd just listen --\"\n\u3000\u3000But Madam Pomfrey suddenly stuffed a large chunk of chocolate into Harry's mouth; he choked, and she seized the opportunity to force him back onto the bed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Now, please, Minister, these children need care. Please leave\n\u3000\u3000The door opened again. It was Dumbledore. Harry swallowed his mouthful of chocolate with great difficulty and got up again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor Dumbledore, Sirius Black --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"For heaven's sake!\" said Madam Pomfrey hysterically. \"Is this a hospital wing or not? Headmaster, I must insist --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"My apologies, Poppy, but I need a word with Mr. Potter and Miss Granger,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"I have just been talking to Sirius Black --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I suppose he's told you the same fairy tale he's planted in Potter's mind?\" spat Snape. \"Something about a rat, and Pettigrew being alive --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That, indeed, is Black's story,\" said Dumbledore, surveying Snape closely through his half-moon spectacles.\n\u3000\u3000\"And does my evidence count for nothing?\" snarled Snape. \"Peter Pettigrew was not in the Shrieking Shack, nor did I see any sign of him on the grounds.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That was because you were knocked out, Professor!\" said Hermione earnestly. \"You didn't arrive in time to hear\n\u3000\u3000\"Miss Granger, HOLD YOUR TONGUE!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Now, Snape,\" said Fudge, startled, \"the young lady is disturbed in her mind, we must make allowances --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I would like to speak to Harry and Hermione alone,\" said Dumbledore abruptly. \"Cornelius, Severus, Poppy -- please leave us.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Headmaster!\" sputtered Madam Pomfrey. \"They need treatment, they need rest --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"This cannot wait,\" said Dumbledore. \"I must insist.\"\n\u3000\u3000Madam Pomfrey pursed her lips and strode away into her office at the end of the ward, slamming the door behind her. Fudge consulted the large gold pocket watch dangling from his waistcoat.\n\u3000\u3000\"The dementors should have arrived by now,\" he said. \"I'll go and meet them. Dumbledore, I'll see you upstairs.\"\n\u3000\u3000He crossed to the door and held it open for Snape, but Snape hadn't moved.\n\u3000\u3000\"You surely don't believe a word of Black's story?\" Snape whispered, his eyes fixed on Dumbledore's face.\n\u3000\u3000\"I wish to speak to Harry and Hermione alone,\" Dumbledore repeated.\n\u3000\u3000Snape took a step toward Dumbledore.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sirius Black showed he was capable of murder at the age of sixteen,\" he breathed. \"You haven't forgotten that, Headmaster? You haven't forgotten that he once tried to kill me?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"My memory is as good as it ever was, Severus,\" said Dumbledore quietly.\n\u3000\u3000Snape turned on his heel and marched through the door Fudge was still holding. It closed behind them, and Dumbledore turned to Harry and Hermione. They both burst into speech at the same time.\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor, Black's telling the truth -- we saw Pettigrew \"-- he escaped when Professor Lupin turned into a werewolf --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"-- he's a rat --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"-- Pettigrew's front paw, I mean, finger, he cut it off --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"-- Pettigrew attacked Ron, it wasn't Sirius --\"\n\u3000\u3000But Dumbledore held up his hand to stem the flood of explanations.\n\u3000\u3000\"It is your turn to listen, and I beg you will not interrupt me, because there is very little time,\" he said quietly. \"There is not a shred of proof to support Black's story, except your word -- and the word of two thirteen-year-old wizards will not convince anybody. A street full of eyewitnesses swore they saw Sirius murder Pettigrew. I myself gave evidence to the Ministry that Sirius had been the Potters' Secret-Keeper.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor Lupin can tell you --\" Harry said, unable to stop himself\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor Lupin is currently deep in the forest, unable to tell anyone anything. By the time he is human again, it will be too late, Sirius will be worse than dead. I might add that werewolves are so mistrusted by most of our kind that his support will count for very little -- and the fact that he and Sirius are old friends --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Listen to me, Harry. It is too late, you understand me? You must see that Professor Snape's version of events is far more convincing than yours.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He hates Sirius,\" Hermione said desperately. \"All because of some stupid trick Sirius played on him --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Sirius has not acted like an innocent man. The attack on the Fat Lady -- entering Gryffindor Tower with a knife -- without Pettigrew, alive or dead, we have no chance of overturning Sirius's sentence.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But you believe us.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes, I do,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"But I have no power to make other men see the truth, or to overrule the Minister of Magic....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry stared up into the grave face and felt as though the ground beneath him were falling sharply away. He had grown used to the idea that Dumbledore could solve anything. He had expected Dumbledore to pull some amazing solution out of the air. But no ... their last hope was gone.\n\u3000\u3000\"What we need,\" said Dumbledore slowly, and his light blue eyes moved from Harry to Hermione, \"is more time.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But --\" Hermione began. And then her eyes became very round. \"OH!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Now, pay attention,\" said Dumbledore, speaking very low, and very clearly. \"Sirius is locked in Professor Flitwick's office on the seventh floor. Thirteenth window from the right of the West Tower. If all goes well, you will be able to save more than one innocent life tonight. But remember this, both of you: you must not be seen. Miss Granger, you know the law -- you know what is at stake.... You -- must -- not -- be -- seen.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't have a clue what was going on. Dumbledore had turned on his heel and looked back as he reached the door.\n\u3000\u3000\"I am going to lock you in. It is --\" he consulted his watch, \"five minutes to midnight. Miss Granger, three turns should do it. Good luck.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Good luck?\" Harry repeated as the door closed behind Dumbledore. \"Three turns? What's he talking about? What are we supposed to do?\"\n\u3000\u3000But Hermione was fumbling with the neck of her robes, pulling from beneath them a very long, very fine gold chain.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, come here,\" she said urgently. \"Quick!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry moved toward her, completely bewildered. She was holding the chain out. He saw a tiny, sparkling hourglass hanging from it.\n\u3000\u3000\"Here --\"\n\u3000\u3000She had thrown the chain around his neck too.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ready?\" she said breathlessly.\n\u3000\u3000\"What are we doing?\" Harry said, completely lost.\n\u3000\u3000Hermione turned the hourglass over three times.\n\u3000\u3000The dark ward dissolved. Harry had the sensation that he was flying very fast, backward. A blur of colors and shapes rushed past him, his ears were pounding, he tried to yell but couldn't hear his own voice --\n\u3000\u3000And then he felt solid ground beneath his feet, and everything came into focus again --\n\u3000\u3000He was standing next to Hermione in the deserted entrance hall and a stream of golden sunlight was falling across the paved floor from the open front doors. He looked wildly around at Hermione, the chain of the hourglass cutting into his neck.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione, what --?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"In here!\" Hermione seized Harry's arm and dragged him across the hall to the door of a broom closet; she opened it, pushed him inside among the buckets and mops, then slammed the door behind them.\n\u3000\u3000\"What -- how -- Hermione, what happened?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We've gone back in time,\" Hermione whispered, lifting the chain off Harry's neck in the darkness. \"Three hours back...\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry found his own leg and gave it a very hard pinch. It hurt a lot, which seemed to rule out the possibility that he was having a very bizarre dream.\n\u3000\u3000\"But --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Shh! Listen! Someone's coming! I think -- I think it might be us!\" Hermione had her ear pressed against the cupboard door.\n\u3000\u3000\"Footsteps across the hall... yes, I think it's us going down to Hagrid's!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Are you telling me,\" Harry whispered, \"that we're here in this cupboard and we're out there too?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" said Hermione, her ear still glued to the cupboard door. \"I'm sure it's us. It doesn't sound like more than three people... and we're walking slowly because we're under the Invisibility Cloak -- \"\n\u3000\u3000She broke off, still listening intently.\n\u3000\u3000\"We've gone down the front steps....\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione sat down on an upturned bucket, looking desperately anxious, but Harry wanted a few questions answered.\n\u3000\u3000\"Where did you get that hourglass thing?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It's called a Time-Turner,\" Hermione whispered, \"and I got it from Professor McGonagall on our first day back. I've been using it all year to get to all my lessons. Professor McGonagall made me swear I wouldn't tell anyone. She had to write all sorts of letters to the Ministry of Magic so I could have one. She had to tell them that I was a model student, and that I'd never, ever use it for anything except my studies.... I've been turning it back so I could do hours over again, that's how I've been doing several lessons at once, see? But...\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, I don't understand what Dumbledore wants us to do. Why did he tell us to go back three hours? How's that going to help Sirius?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry stared at her shadowy face.\n\u3000\u3000\"There must be something that happened around now he wants us to change,\" he said slowly. \"What happened? We were walking down to Hagrid's three hours ago....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"This is three hours ago, and we are walking down to Hagrid's,\" said Hermione. \"We just heard ourselves leaving....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry frowned; he felt as though he were screwing up his whole brain in concentration.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dumbledore just said -- just said we could save more than one innocent life....\" And then it hit him. \"Hermione, we're going to save Buckbeak!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But -- how will that help Sirius?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Dumbledore said -- he just told us where the window is -- the window of Flitwick's office! Where they've got Sirius locked up! We've got to fly Buckbeak up to the window and rescue Sirius! Sirius can escape on Buckbeak -- they can escape together!\"\n\u3000\u3000From what Harry could see of Hermione's face, she looked terrified.\n\u3000\u3000\"If we manage that without being seen, it'll be a miracle!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, we've got to try, haven't we?\" said Harry. He stood up and pressed his ear against the door. \"Doesn't sound like anyone's there.... Come on, let's go.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry pushed open the closet door. The entrance hall was deserted. As quietly and quickly as they could, they darted out of the closet and down the stone steps. The shadows were already lengthening, the tops of the trees in the Forbidden Forest gilded once more with gold.\n\u3000\u3000\"If anyone's looking out of the window --\" Hermione squeaked, looking up at the castle behind them.\n\u3000\u3000\"We'll run for it,\" said Harry determinedly. \"Straight into the forest, all right? We'll have to hide behind a tree or something and keep a lookout --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Okay, but we'll go around by the greenhouses!\" said Hermione breathlessly. \"We need to keep out of sight of Hagrid's front door, or we'll see us! We must be nearly at Hagrid's by now!\"\n\u3000\u3000Still working out what she meant, Harry set off at a sprint, Hermione behind him. They tore across the vegetable gardens to the greenhouses, paused for a moment behind them, then set off again, fast as they could, skirting around the Whomping Willow, tearing toward the shelter of the forest....\n\u3000\u3000Safe in the shadows of the trees, Harry turned around; seconds later, Hermione arrived beside him, panting.\n\u3000\u3000\"Right,\" she gasped. \"We need to sneak over to Hagrid's.... Keep out of sight, Harry....\"\n\u3000\u3000They made their way silently through the trees, keeping to the very edge of the forest. Then, as they glimpsed the front of Hagrid's house, they heard a knock upon his door. They moved quickly behind a wide oak trunk and peered out from either side. Hagrid had appeared in his doorway, shaking and white, looking around to see who had knocked. And Harry heard his own voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's us. We're wearing the Invisibility Cloak. Let us in and we can take it off.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeh shouldn've come!\" Hagrid whispered. He stood back, then shut the door quickly.\n\u3000\u3000\"This is the weirdest thing we've ever done,\" Harry said fervently.\n\u3000\u3000\"Let's move along a bit,\" Hermione whispered. \"We need to get nearer to Buckbeak!\"\n\u3000\u3000They crept through the trees until they saw the nervous hippogriff, tethered to the fence around Hagrid's pumpkin patch.\n\u3000\u3000\"Now?\" Harry whispered.\n\u3000\u3000\"No!\" said Hermione. \"If we steal him now, those Committee people will think Hagrid set him free! We've got to wait until they've seen he's tied outside!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That's going to give us about sixty seconds,\" said Harry. This was starting to seem impossible.\n\u3000\u3000At that moment, there was a crash of breaking china from inside Hagrid's cabin.\n\u3000\u3000\"That's Hagrid breaking the milk jug,\" Hermione whispered. \"I'm going to find Scabbers in a moment --\"\n\u3000\u3000Sure enough, a few minutes later, they heard Hermione's shriek of surprise.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione,\" said Harry suddenly, \"what if we -- we just run in there and grab Pettigrew --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No!\" said Hermione in a terrified whisper. \"Don't you understand? We're breaking one of the most important wizarding laws! Nobody's supposed to change time, nobody! You heard Dumbledore, if we're seen --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We'd only be seen by ourselves and Hagrid!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, what do you think you'd do if you saw yourself bursting into Hagrid's house?\" said Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'd -- I'd think I'd gone mad,\" said Harry, \"or I'd think there was some Dark Magic going on --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Exactly! You wouldn't understand, you might even attack yourself! Don't you see? Professor McGonagall told me what awful things have happened when wizards have meddled with time.... Loads of them ended up killing their past or future selves by mistake!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Okay!\" said Harry. \"It was just an idea, I just thought\n\u3000\u3000But Hermione nudged him and pointed toward the castle. Harry moved his head a few inches to get a clear view of the distant front doors. Dumbledore, Fudge, the old Committee member, and Macnair the executioner were coming down the steps.\n\u3000\u3000\"We're about to come out!\" Hermione breathed.\n\u3000\u3000And sure enough, moments later, Hagrid's back door opened, and Harry saw himself, Ron, and Hermione walking out of it with Hagrid. It was, without a doubt, the strangest sensation of his life, standing behind the tree, and watching himself in the pumpkin patch.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's Okay, Beaky, it's okay...\" Hagrid said to Buckbeak. Then he turned to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. \"Go on. Get goin'.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hagrid, we can't --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We'll tell them what really happened\n\u3000\u3000\"They can't kill him --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Go! It's bad enough without you lot in trouble an' all!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry watched the Hermione in the pumpkin patch throw the Invisibility Cloak over him and Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Go quick. Don' listen....\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a knock on Hagrid's front door. The execution party had arrived. Hagrid turned, around and headed back into his cabin, leaving the back door ajar. Harry watched the grass flatten in patches all around the cabin and heard three pairs of feet retreating. He, Ron, and Hermione had gone... but the Harry and Hermione hidden in the trees could now hear what was happening inside the cabin through the back door.\n\u3000\u3000\"Where is the beast?\" came the cold voice of Macnair.\n\u3000\u3000\"Out -- outside,\" Hagrid croaked.\n\u3000\u3000Harry pulled his head out of sight as Macnair's face appeared at Hagrid's window, staring out at Buckbeak. Then they heard Fudge.\n\u3000\u3000\"We -- er -- have to read you the official notice of execution, Hagrid. I'll make it quick. And then you and Macnair need to sign it. Macnair, You're supposed to listen too, that's procedure --\"\n\u3000\u3000Macnair's face vanished from the window. It was now or never.\n\u3000\u3000\"Wait here,\" Harry whispered to Hermione. \"I'll do it.\"\n\u3000\u3000As Fudge's voice started again, Harry darted out from behind his tree, vaulted the fence into the pumpkin patch, and approached Buckbeak.\n\u3000\u3000\"It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak, hereafter called the condemned, shall he executed on the sixth of June at sundown --\"\n\u3000\u3000Careful not to blink, Harry stared up into Buckbeak's fierce orange eyes once more and bowed. Buckbeak sank to his scaly knees and then stood up again. Harry began to fumble with the knot of rope tying Buckbeak to the fence.\n\u3000\u3000\"... sentenced to execution by beheading, to be carried out by the Committee's appointed executioner, Walden Macnai...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Come on, Buckbeak,\" Harry murmured, \"come on, we're going to help you. Quietly... quietly...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"... as witnessed below. Hagrid, you sign here...\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry threw all his weight onto the rope, but Buckbeak had dug in his front feet.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, let's get this over with,\" said the reedy voice of the Committee member from inside Hagrid's cabin. \"Hagrid, perhaps it will be better if you stay inside --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No, I -- I wan' ter be with him.... I don' wan' him ter be alone --\"\n\u3000\u3000Footsteps echoed from within the cabin.\n\u3000\u3000\"Buckbeak, move!\" Harry hissed.\n\u3000\u3000Harry tugged harder on the rope around Buckbeak's neck. The hippogriff began to walk, rustling its wings irritably. They were still ten feet away from the forest, in plain view of Hagrid's back door. \"One moment, please, Macnair,\" came Dumbledore's voice. \"You need to sign too.\" The footsteps stopped. Harry heaved on the rope. Buckbeak snapped his beak and walked a little faster.\n\u3000\u3000Hermione's white face was sticking out from behind a tree.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, hurry!\" she mouthed.\n\u3000\u3000Harry could still hear Dumbledore's voice talking from within the cabin. He gave the rope another wrench. Buckbeak broke into a grudging trot. They had reached the trees....\n\u3000\u3000\"Quick! Quick!\" Hermione moaned, darting out from behind her tree, seizing the rope too and adding her weight to make Buckbeak move faster. Harry looked over his shoulder; they were now blocked from sight; they couldn't see Hagrid's garden at all.\n\u3000\u3000\"Stop!\" he whispered to Hermione. \"They might hear us\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid's back door had opened with a bang. Harry, Hermione, and Buckbeak stood quite still; even the hippogriff seemed to be listening intently.\n\u3000\u3000Silence... then --\n\u3000\u3000\"Where is it?\" said the reedy voice of the Committee member. \"Where is the beast?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It was tied here!\" said the executioner furiously. I saw it! just here!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"How extraordinary,\" said Dumbledore. There was a note of amusement in his voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"Beaky!\" said Hagrid huskily.\n\u3000\u3000There was a swishing noise, and the thud of an axe. The executioner seemed to have swung it into the fence in anger. And then came the howling, and this time they could hear Hagrid's words through his sobs.\n\u3000\u3000\"Gone! Gone! Bless his little beak, he's gone! Musta pulled himself free! Beaky, yeh clever boy!\"\n\u3000\u3000Buckbeak started to strain against the rope, trying to get back to Hagrid. Harry and Hermione tightened their grip and dug their heels into the forest floor to stop him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Someone untied him!\" the executioner was snarling. \"We should search the grounds, the forest.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Macnair, if Buckbeak has indeed been stolen, do you really think the thief will have led him away on foot?\" said Dumbledore, still sounding amused. \"Search the skies, if you will.... Hagrid, I could do with a cup of tea. Or a large brandy.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"O' -- o' course, Professor,\" said Hagrid, who sounded weak with happiness. \"Come in, come in....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Hermione listened closely. They heard footsteps, the soft cursing of the executioner, the snap of the door, and then silence once more.\n\u3000\u3000\"Now what?\" whispered Harry, looking around.\n\u3000\u3000\"We'll have to hide in here,\" said Hermione, who looked very shaken. \"We need to wait until they've gone back to the castle. Then we wait until it's safe to fly Buckbeak up to Sirius's window. He won't be there for another couple of hours.... Oh, this is going to be difficult....\"\n\u3000\u3000She looked nervously over her shoulder into the depths of the forest. The sun was setting now.\n\u3000\u3000\"We're going to have to move,\" said Harry, thinking hard. \"We've got to be able to see the Whomping Willow, or we won't know what's going on.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Okay,\" said Hermione, getting a firmer grip on Buckbeak's rope. \"But we've got to keep out of sight, Harry, remember....\"\n\u3000\u3000They moved around the edge of the forest, darkness falling thickly around them, until they were hidden behind a clump of trees through which they could make out the Willow.\n\u3000\u3000\"There's Ron!\" said Harry suddenly.\n\u3000\u3000A dark figure was sprinting across the lawn and its shout echoed through the still night air.\n\u3000\u3000\"Get away from him -- get away -- Scabbers, come here --\"\n\u3000\u3000And then they saw two more figures materialize out of nowhere. Harry watched himself and Hermione chasing after Ron. Then he saw Ron dive.\n\u3000\u3000\"Gotcha! Get off, you stinking cat --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"There's Sirius!\" said Harry. The great shape of the dog had bounded out from the roots of the Willow. They saw him bowl Harry over, then seize Ron....\n\u3000\u3000\"Looks even worse from here, doesn't it?\" said Harry, watching the dog pulling Ron into the roots. \"Ouch -- look, I just got walloped by the tree -- and so did you -- this is weird--\"\n\u3000\u3000The Whomping Willow was creaking and lashing out with its lower branches; they could see themselves darting here and there, trying to reach the trunk. And then the tree froze.\n\u3000\u3000\"That was Crookshanks pressing the knot,\" said Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"And there we go...\" Harry muttered. \"We're in.\"\n\u3000\u3000The moment they disappeared, the tree began to move again. Seconds later, they heard footsteps quite close by. Dumbledore, Macnair, Fudge, and the old Committee member were making their way up to the castle.\n\u3000\u3000\"Right after we'd gone down into the passage!\" said Hermione. \"If only Dumbledore had come with us...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Macnair and Fudge would've come too,\" said Harry bitterly. \"I bet you anything Fudge would've told Macnair to murder Sirius on the spot....\"\n\u3000\u3000They watched the four men climb the castle steps and disappear from view. For a few minutes the scene was deserted. Then --\n\u3000\u3000\"Here comes Lupin!\" said Harry as they saw another figure sprinting down the stone steps and hating toward the Willow. Harry looked up at the sky. Clouds were obscuring the moon completely.\n\u3000\u3000They watched Lupin seize a broken branch from the ground and prod the knot on the trunk. The tree stopped fighting, and Lupin, too, disappeared into the gap in its roots.\n\u3000\u3000\"If he'd only grabbed the cloak,\" said Harry. \"It's just lying there....\"\n\u3000\u3000He turned to Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"If I just dashed out now and grabbed it, Snape'd never be able to get it and --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, we mustn't be seen!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"How can you stand this?\" he asked Hermione fiercely. \"Just standing here and watching it happen?\" He hesitated. \"I'm going to grab the cloak!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, no!\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione seized the back of Harry's robes not a moment too soon. just then, they heard a burst of song. It was Hagrid, making his way up to the castle, singing at the top of his voice, and weaving slightly as he walked. A large bottle was swinging from his hands.\n\u3000\u3000\"See?\" Hermione whispered. \"See what would have happened? We've got to keep out of sight! No, Buckbeak!\"\n\u3000\u3000The hippogriff was making frantic attempts to get to Hagrid again; Harry seized his rope too, straining to hold Buckbeak back. They watched Hagrid meander tipsily up to the castle. He was gone. Buckbeak stopped fighting to get away. His head drooped sadly.\n\u3000\u3000Barely two minutes later, the castle doors flew open yet again, and Snape came charging out of them, running toward the Willow.\n\u3000\u3000Harry's fists clenched as they watched Snape skid to a halt next to the tree, looking around. He grabbed the cloak and held it up.\n\u3000\u3000\"Get your filthy hands off it,\" Harry snarled under his breath. \"Shh!\"\n\u3000\u3000Snape seized the branch Lupin had used to freeze the tree, prodded the knot, and vanished from view as he put on the cloak.\n\u3000\u3000\"So that's it,\" said Hermione quietly. \"We're all down there... and now we've just got to wait until we come back up again....\"\n\u3000\u3000She took the end of Buckbeak's rope and tied it securely around the nearest tree, then sat down on the dry ground, arms around her knees.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, there's something I don't understand.... Why didn't the dementors get Sirius? I remember them coming, and then I think I passed out... there were so many of them....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry sat down too. He explained what he'd seen; how, as the nearest dementor had lowered its mouth to Harry's, a large silver something had come galloping across the lake and forced the dementors to retreat.\n\u3000\u3000Hermione's mouth was slightly open by the time Harry had finished.\n\u3000\u3000\"But what was it?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"There's only one thing it could have been, to make the dementors go,\" said Harry. \"A real Patronus. A powerful one.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But who conjured it?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't say anything. He was thinking back to the person he'd seen on the other bank of the lake. He knew who he thought it had been... but how could it have been?\n\u3000\u3000\"Didn't you see what they looked like?\" said Hermione eagerly. \"Was it one of the teachers?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Harry. \"He wasn't a teacher.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But it must have been a really powerful wizard, to drive all those dementors away... If the Patronus was shining so brightly, didn't it light him up? Couldn't you see --?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, I saw him,\" said Harry slowly. \"But... maybe I imagined it.... I wasn't thinking straight.... I passed out right afterward....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Who did you think it was?\"\n\u3000\u3000I think --\" Harry swallowed, knowing how strange this was going to sound. I think it was my dad.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry glanced up at Hermione and saw that her mouth was fully open now. She was gazing at him with a mixture of alarm and pity.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, your dad's -- well -- dead,\" she said quietly.\n\u3000\u3000\"I know that,\" said Harry quickly.\n\u3000\u3000\"You think you saw his ghost?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't know... no... he looked solid....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But then --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Maybe I was seeing things,\" said Harry. \"But... from what I could see... it looked like him.... I've got photos of him....\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione was still looking at him as though worried about his sanity.\n\u3000\u3000I know it sounds crazy,\" said Harry flatly. He turned to took at Buckbeak, who was digging his beak into the ground, apparently searching for worms. But he wasn't really watching Buckbeak.\n\u3000\u3000He was thinking about his father and about his father's three oldest friends... Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs.... Had all four of them been out on the grounds tonight? Wormtail had reappeared this evening when everyone had thought he was dead.... Was it so impossible his father had done the same? Had he been seeing things across the take? The figure had been too far away to see distinctly... yet he had felt sure, for a moment, before he'd lost consciousness....\n\u3000\u3000The leaves overhead rustled faintly in the breeze. The moon drifted in and out of sight behind the shifting clouds. Hermione sat with her face turned toward the Willow, waiting.\n\u3000\u3000And then, at last, after over an hour...\n\u3000\u3000\"Here we come!\" Hermione whispered.\n\u3000\u3000She and Harry got to their feet. Buckbeak raised his head. They saw Lupin, Ron, and Pettigrew clambering awkwardly out of the hole in the roots. Then came Hermione... then the unconscious Snape, drifting weirdly upward. Next came Harry and Black. They all began to walk toward the castle.\n\u3000\u3000Harry's heart was starting to beat very fast. He glanced up at the sky. Any moment now, that cloud was going to move aside and show the moon....\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry,\" Hermione muttered as though she knew exactly what he was thinking, \"we've got to stay put. We mustn't be seen. There's nothing we can do....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"So we're just going to let Pettigrew escape all over again.. said Harry quietly.\n\u3000\u3000\"How do you expect to find a rat in the dark?\" snapped Hermione. \"There's nothing we can do! We came back to help Sirius; we're not supposed to be doing anything else!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"All right!\"\n\u3000\u3000The moon slid out from behind its cloud. They saw the tiny figures across the grounds stop. Then they saw movement --\n\u3000\u3000\"There goes Lupin,\" Hermione whispered. \"He's transforming\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione!\" said Harry suddenly. \"We've got to move!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We mustn't, I keep telling you --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Not to interfere! Lupin's going to run into the forest, right at us!\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione gasped.\n\u3000\u3000\"Quick!\" she moaned, dashing to untie Buckbeak. \"Quick! Where are we going to go? Where are we going to hide? The dementors wilt be coming any moment --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Back to Hagrid's!\" Harry said. \"It's empty now -- come on!\"\n\u3000\u3000They ran as fast as they could, Buckbeak cantering along behind them. They could hear the werewolf howling behind them....\n\u3000\u3000The cabin was in sight; Harry skidded to the door, wrenched it open, and Hermione and Buckbeak flashed past him; Harry threw himself in after them and bolted the door. Fang the boarhound barked loudly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Shh, Fang, it's us!\" said Hermione, hurrying over and scratching his ears to quieten him. \"That was really close!\" she said to Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah...\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry was looking out of the window. It was much harder to see what was going on from here. Buckbeak seemed very happy to find himself back inside Hagrid's house. He lay down in front of the fire, folded his wings contentedly, and seemed ready for a good nap.\n\u3000\u3000\"I think I'd better go outside again, you know,\" said Harry slowly. \"I can't see what's going on -- we won't know when it's time --\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione looked up. Her expression was suspicious.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm not going to try and interfere,\" said Harry quickly. \"But if we don't see what's going on, how're we going to know when it's time to rescue Sirius?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well... okay, then... I'll wait here with Buckbeak... but Harry, be careful -- there's a werewolf out there -- and the dementors\n\u3000\u3000Harry stepped outside again and edged around the cabin. He could hear yelping in the distance. That meant the dementors were closing in on Sirius.... He and Hermione would be running to him any moment....\n\u3000\u3000Harry stared out toward the lake, his heart doing a kind of drumroll in his chest.... Whoever had sent that Patronus would be appearing at any moment....\n\u3000\u3000For a fraction of a second he stood, irresolute, in front of Hagrid's door. You must not be seen. But he didn't want to be seen. He wanted to do the seeing.... He had to know...\n\u3000\u3000And there were the dementors. They were emerging out of the darkness from every direction, gliding around the edges of the lake.... They were moving away from where Harry stood, to the opposite bank.... He wouldn't have to get near them....\n\u3000\u3000Harry began to run. He had no thought in his head except his father... If it was him... if it really was him... he had to know, had to find out....\n\u3000\u3000The lake was coming nearer and nearer, but there was no sign of anybody. On the opposite bank, he could see tiny glimmers of silver -- his own attempts at a Patronus --\n\u3000\u3000There was a bush at the very edge of the water. Harry threw himself behind it, peering desperately through the leaves. On the opposite bank, the glimmers of silver were suddenly extinguished. A terrified excitement shot through him -- any moment now --\n\u3000\u3000\"Come on!\" he muttered, staring about. \"Where are you? Dad, come on --\"\n\u3000\u3000But no one came. Harry raised his head to look at the circle of dementors across the lake. One of them was lowering its hood. It was time for the rescuer to appear -- but no one was coming to help this time --\n\u3000\u3000And then it hit him -- he understood. He hadn't seen his father -- he had seen himself --\n\u3000\u3000Harry flung himself out from behind the bush and pulled out his wand.\n\u3000\u3000\"EXPECTO PATRONUM! \"he yelled.\n\u3000\u3000And out of the end of his wand burst, not a shapeless cloud of mist, but a blinding, dazzling, silver animal. He screwed up his eyes, trying to see what it was. It looked like a horse. It was galloping silently away from him, across the black surface of the lake. He saw it lower its head and charge at the swarming dementors.... Now it was galloping around and around the black shapes on the ground, and the dementors were falling back, scattering, retreating into the darkness.... They were gone.\n\u3000\u3000The Patronus turned. It was cantering back toward Harry across the still surface of the water. It wasn't a horse. It wasn't a unicorn, either. It was a stag. It was shining brightly as the moon above ... it was coming back to him....\n\u3000\u3000It stopped on the bank. Its hooves made no mark on the soft ground as it stared at Harry with its large, silver eyes. Slowly, it bowed its antlered head. And Harry realized... \"Prongs, \"he whispered.\n\u3000\u3000But as his trembling fingertips stretched toward the creature, it vanished.\n\u3000\u3000Harry stood there, hand still outstretched. Then, with a great leap of his heart, he heard hooves behind him -he whirled around and saw Hermione dashing toward him, dragging Buckbeak behind her.\n\u3000\u3000\"What did you do?\" she said fiercely. \"You said you were only going to keep a lookout!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I just saved all our lives...,\" said Harry. \"Get behind here -- behind this bush -- I'll explain.\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione listened to what had just happened with her mouth open yet again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Did anyone see you?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes, haven't you been listening? I saw me but I thought I was my dad! It's okay!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, I can't believe it.... You conjured up a Patronus that drove away all those dementors! That's very, very advanced magic. I knew I could do it this time,\" said Harry, \"because I'd already done it.... Does that make sense?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't know -- Harry, look at Snape!\"\n\u3000\u3000Together they peered around the bush at the other bank. Snape had regained consciousness. He was conjuring stretchers and lifting the limp forms of Harry, Hermione, and Black onto them. A fourth stretcher, no doubt bearing Ron, was already floating at his side. Then, wand held out in front of him, he moved them away toward the castle.\n\u3000\u3000\"Right, it's nearly time,\" said Hermione tensely, looking at her watch. \"We've got about forty-five minutes until Dumbledore locks the door to the hospital wing. We've got to rescue Sirius and get back into the ward before anybody realizes we're missing.... 11\n\u3000\u3000They waited, watching the moving clouds reflected in the lake, while the bush next to them whispered in the breeze. Buckbeak, bored, was ferreting for worms again.\n\u3000\u3000\"D' you reckon he's up there yet?\" said Harry, checking his watch. He looked up at the castle and began counting the windows to the right of the West Tower.\n\u3000\u3000\"Look!\" Hermione whispered. \"\\Who's that? Someone's coming back out of the castle!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry stared through the darkness. The man was hurrying across the grounds, toward one of the entrances. Something shiny glinted in his belt.\n\u3000\u3000\"Macnair!\" said Harry. \"The executioner! He's gone to get the dementors! This is it, Hermione --\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione put her hands on Buckbeak's back and Harry gave her a leg up. Then he placed his foot on one of the lower branches of the bush and climbed up in front of her. He pulled Buckbeak's rope back over his neck and tied it to the other side of his collar like reins.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ready?\" he whispered to Hermione. \"YotM better hold on to me --\n\u3000\u3000He nudged Buckbeak's sides with his heels.\n\u3000\u3000Buckbeak soared straight into the dark air. Harry gripped his flanks with his knees, feeling the great wings rising powerfully beneath them. Hermione was holding Harry very tight around the waist; he could hear her muttering, \"Oh, no -- I don't like this oh, I really don't like this --\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry urged Buckbeak forward. They were gliding quietly toward the upper floors of the castle.... Harry pulled hard on the left-hand side of the rope, and Buckbeak turned. Harry was trying to count the windows flashing past --\n\u3000\u3000\"Whoa!\" he said, pulling backward as hard as he could.\n\u3000\u3000Buckbeak slowed down and they found themselves at a stop, unless you counted the fact that they kept rising up and down several feet as the hippogriff beat his wings to remain airborne.\n\u3000\u3000\"He's there!\" Harry said, spotting Sirius as they rose up beside the window. He reached out, and as Buckbeak's wings fell, was able to tap sharply on the glass.\n\u3000\u3000Black looked up. Harry saw his jaw drop. He leapt from his chair, hurried to the window and tried to open it, but it was locked.\n\u3000\u3000\"Stand back!\" Hermione called to him, and she took out her wand, still gripping the back of Harry's robes with her left hand.\n\u3000\u3000\"Alohomora!\"\n\u3000\u3000The window sprang open.\n\u3000\u3000\"How -- how --?\" said Black weakly, staring at the hippogriff\n\u3000\u3000\"Get on -- there's not much time,\" said Harry, gripping Buckbeak firmly on either side of his sleek neck to hold him steady. \"You've got to get out of here -the dementors are coming -- Macnair's gone to get them.\"\n\u3000\u3000Black placed a hand on either side of the window frame and heaved his head and shoulders out of it. It was very lucky he was so thin. In seconds, he had managed to fling one leg over Buckbeak's back and pull himself onto the hippogriff behind Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"Okay, Buckbeak, up!\" said Harry, shaking the rope. \"Up to the tower -- come on.\n\u3000\u3000The hippogriff gave one sweep of its mighty wings and they were soaring upward again, high as the top of the West Tower. Buckbeak landed with a clatter on the battlements, and Harry and Hermione slid off him at once.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sirius, you'd better go, quick,\" Harry panted. \"They'll reach Flitwick's office any moment, they'll find out you're gone.\"\n\u3000\u3000Buckbeak pawed the ground, tossing his sharp head.\n\u3000\u3000\"What happened to the other boy? Ron?\" croaked Sirius.\n\u3000\u3000\"He's going to be okay. He's still out of it, but Madam Pomfrey says she'll be able to make him better. Quick -- go --\"\n\u3000\u3000But Black was still staring down at Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"How can I ever thank --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"GO!\" Harry and Hermione shouted together.\n\u3000\u3000Black wheeled Buckbeak around, facing the open sky.\n\u3000\u3000\"We'll see each other again,\" he said. \"You are -- truly your father's son, Harry....\"\n\u3000\u3000He squeezed Buckbeak's sides with his heels. Harry and Hermione jumped back as the enormous wings rose once more.... The hippogriff took off into the air.... He and his rider became smaller and smaller as Harry gazed after them... then a cloud drifted across the moon.... They were gone.\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO\n\u3000\u3000OWL POST AGAIN\n\u3000\u3000Harry!\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione was tugging at his sleeve, staring at her watch. \"We've got exactly ten minutes to get back down to the hospital wing without anybody seeing us -- before Dumbledore locks the door --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Okay,\" said Harry, wrenching his gaze from the sky, \"let's go....\"\n\u3000\u3000They slipped through the doorway behind them and down a tightly spiraling stone staircase. As they reached the bottom of it, they heard voices. They flattened themselves against the wall and listened. It sounded like Fudge and Snape. They were walking quickly along the corridor at the foot of the staircase.\n\u3000\u3000\"... only hope Dumbledore's not going to make difficulties,\" Snape was saying. \"The Kiss will be performed immediately?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"As soon as Macnair returns with the dementors. This whole Black affair has been highly embarrassing. I can't tell you how much I'm looking forward to informing the Daily Prophet that we've got him at last.... I daresay they'll want to interview you, Snape... and once young Harry's back in his right mind, I expect he'll want to tell the Prophet exactly how you saved him....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry clenched his teeth. He caught a glimpse of Snape's smirk as he and Fudge passed Harry and Hermione's hiding place. Their footsteps died away. Harry and Hermione waited a few moments to make sure they'd really gone, then started to run in the opposite direction. Down one staircase, then another, along a new ,corridor -- then they heard a cackling ahead.\n\u3000\u3000\"Peeves!\" Harry muttered, grabbing Hermione's wrist. \"In here!\"\n\u3000\u3000They tore into a deserted classroom to their left just in time. Peeves seemed to be bouncing along the corridor in boisterous good spirits, laughing his head off.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, he's horrible,\" whispered Hermione, her ear to the door. \"I bet he's all excited because the dementors are going to finish off Sirius....\" She checked her watch. \"Three minutes, Harry!\"\n\u3000\u3000They waited until Peeves's gloating voice had faded into the distance, then slid back out of the room and broke into a run again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione -- what'll happen -- if we don't get back inside before Dumbledore locks the door?\" Harry panted.\n\u3000\u3000I don't want to think about it!\" Hermione moaned, checking her watch again. \"One minute!\"\n\u3000\u3000They had reached the end of the corridor with the hospital wing entrance. \"Okay -- I can hear Dumbledore,\" said Hermione tensely. \"Come on, Harry!\"\n\u3000\u3000They crept along the corridor. The door opened. Dumbledore's back appeared.\n\u3000\u3000\"I am going to lock you in,\" they heard him saying. \"it is five minutes to midnight. Miss Granger, three turns should do It. Good luck.\"\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore backed out of the room, closed the door, and took out his wand to magically lock it. Panicking, Harry and Hermione ran forward. Dumbledore looked up, and a wide smile appeared under the long silver mustache. \"Well?\" he said quietly.\n\u3000\u3000\"We did it!\" said Harry breathlessly. \"Sirius has gone, on Buckbeak....\"\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore beamed at them.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well done. I think --\" He listened intently for any sound within the hospital wing. \"Yes, I think you've gone too -- get inside -- I'll lock you in --\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Hermione slipped back inside the dormitory. It was empty except for Ron, who was still lying motionless in the end bed. As the lock clicked behind them, Harry and Hermione crept back to their own beds, Hermione tucking the Time-Turner back under her robes. A moment later, Madam Pomfrey came striding back out of her office.\n\u3000\u3000\"Did I hear the headmaster leaving? Am I allowed to look after my patients now?\"\n\u3000\u3000She was in a very bad mood. Harry and Hermione thought it best to accept their chocolate quietly. Madam Pomfrey stood over them, making sure they ate it. But Harry could hardly swallow. He and Hermione were waiting, listening, their nerves jangling.... And then, as they both took a fourth piece of chocolate from Madam Pomfrey, they heard a distant roar of fury echoing from somewhere above them....\n\u3000\u3000\"What was that?\" said Madam Pomfrey in alarm.\n\u3000\u3000Now they could hear angry voices, growing louder and louder. Madam Pomfrey was staring at the door.\n\u3000\u3000\"Really -- they'll wake everybody up! What do they think they're doing?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry was trying to hear what the voices were saying. They were drawing nearer --\n\u3000\u3000\"He must have Disapparated, Severus. We should have left somebody in the room with him. When this gets out --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"HE DIDN'T DISAPPARATE!\" Snape roared, now very close at hand. \"YOU CAN'T APPARATE OR DISAPPARATE INSIDE THIS CASTLE! THIS -- HAS -- SOMETHING -- TO -- DO -- WITH -- POTTER!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Severus -- be reasonable -- Harry has been locked up --\"\n\u3000\u3000BAM.\n\u3000\u3000The door of the hospital wing burst open.\n\u3000\u3000Fudge, Snape, and Dumbledore came striding into the ward. Dumbledore alone looked calm. Indeed, he looked as though he was quite enjoying himself. Fudge appeared angry. But Snape was beside himself.\n\u3000\u3000\"OUT WITH IT, POTTER!\" he bellowed. \"WHAT DID YOU DO?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor Snape!\" shrieked Madam Pomfrey. \"Control yourself!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"See here, Snape, be reasonable,\" said Fudge. \"This door's been locked, we just saw --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"THEY HELPED HIM ESCAPE, I KNOW IT!\" Snape howled, pointing at Harry and Hermione. His face was twisted; spit was flying from his mouth.\n\u3000\u3000\"Calm down, man!\" Fudge barked. \"You're talking nonsense!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"YOU DON'T KNOW POTTER!\" shrieked Snape. \"HE DID IT, I KNOW HE DID IT --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That will do, Severus,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"Think about what you are saying. This door has been locked since I left the ward ten minutes ago. Madam Pomfrey, have these students left their beds?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Of course not!\" said Madam Pomfrey, bristling. \"I would have heard them!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, there you have it, Severus,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"Unless you are suggesting that Harry and Hermione are able to be in two places at once, I'm afraid I don't see any point in troubling them further.\"\n\u3000\u3000Snape stood there, seething, staring from Fudge, who looked thoroughly shocked at his behavior, to Dumbledore, whose eyes were twinkling behind his glasses. Snape whirled about, robes swishing behind him, and stormed out of the ward.\n\u3000\u3000\"Fellow seems quite unbalanced,\" said Fudge, staring after him. \"I'd watch out for him if I were you, Dumbledore.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, he's not unbalanced,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"He's just suffered a severe disappointment.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He's not the only one!\" puffed Fudge. \"The Daily Prophet's going to have a field day! We had Black cornered and he slipped through our fingers yet again! All it needs now is for the story of that hippogriff's escape to get out, and I'll be a laughingstock! Well... I'd better go and notify the Ministry.....\n\u3000\u3000\"And the dementors?\" said Dumbledore. \"They'll be removed from the school, I trust?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh yes, they'll have to go,\" said Fudge, running his fingers\n\u3000\u3000distractedly through his hair. \"Never dreamed they'd attempt to administer the Kiss on an innocent boy... Completely out of control... no, I'll have them packed off back to Azkaban tonight.... Perhaps we should think about dragons at the school entrance....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hagrid would like that,\" said Dumbledore, smiling at Harry and Hermione. As he and Fudge left the dormitory, Madam Pomfrey hurried to the door and locked it again. Muttering angrily to herself, she headed back to her office.\n\u3000\u3000There was a low moan from the other end of the ward. Ron had woken up. They could see him sitting up, rubbing his head, looking around.\n\u3000\u3000\"What -- what happened?\" he groaned. \"Harry? Why are we in here? Where's Sirius? Where's Lupin? What's going on?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Hermione looked at each other.\n\u3000\u3000\"You explain,\" said Harry, helping himself to some more chocolate.\n\u3000\u3000When Harry, Ron, and Hermione left the hospital wing at noon the next day, it was to find an almost deserted castle. The sweltering, heat and the end of the exams meant that everyone was taking full advantage of another Hogsmeade visit. Neither Ron nor Hermione felt like going, however, so they and Harry wandered onto the grounds, still talking about the extraordinary events of the previous night and wondering where Sirius and Buckbeak were now. Sitting near the lake, watching the giant squid waving its tentacles lazily above the water, Harry lost the thread of the conversation as he looked across to the opposite bank. The stag had galloped toward him from there just last night....\n\u3000\u3000A shadow fell across them and they looked 'tip to see a very bleary-eyed Hagrid, mopping his sweaty face with one of his tablecloth-sized handkerchiefs and beaming down at them.\n\u3000\u3000\"Know I shouldn' feel happy, after wha' happened las' night,\" he said. \"I mean, Black escapin' again, an, everythin' -- but guess what?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" they said, pretending to look curious.\n\u3000\u3000\"Beaky! He escaped! He's free! Bin celebratin' all night!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That's wonderful!\" said Hermione, giving Ron a reproving look because he looked as though he was close to laughing.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah... can't've tied him up properly,\" said Hagrid, gazing happily out over the grounds. \"I was worried this mornin', mind... thought he mighta met Professor Lupin on the grounds, but Lupin says he never ate anythin' las' night....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" said Harry quickly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Blimey, haven' yeh heard?\" said Hagrid, his smile fading a little. He lowered his voice, even though there was nobody in sight. \"Er -- Snape told all the Slytherins this mornin'.... Thought everyone'd know by now... Professor Lupin's a werewolf, see. An' he was loose on the grounds las' night.... He's packin' now, o' course.\n\u3000\u3000\"He's packing?\" said Harry, alarmed. \"Why?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Leavin', isn' he?\" said Hagrid, looking surprised that Harry had to ask. \"Resigned firs' thing this mornin'. Says he can't risk it happenin again.\n\u3000\u3000Harry scrambled to his feet.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm going to see him,\" he said to Ron and Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"But if he's resigned --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"-- doesn't sound like there's anything we can do --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't care. I still want to see him. I'll meet you back here.\"\n\u3000\u3000Lupin's office door was open. He had already packed most of his things. The grindylow's empty tank stood next to his battered old suitcase, which was open and nearly full. Lupin was bending over something on his desk and looked up only when Harry knocked on the door.\n\u3000\u3000\"I saw you coming,\" said Lupin, smiling. He pointed to the parchment he had been poring over. It was the Marauder's Map.\n\u3000\u3000\"I just saw Hagrid,\" said Harry. \"And he said you'd resigned. It's not true, is it?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm afraid it is,\" said Lupin. He started opening his desk drawers and taking out the contents.\n\u3000\u3000\"Why?\" said Harry. \"The Ministry of Magic don't think you were helping Sirius, do they?\"\n\u3000\u3000Lupin crossed to the door and closed it behind Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"No. Professor Dumbledore managed to convince Fudge that I was trying to save your lives.\" He sighed. \"That was the final straw for Severus. I think the loss of the Order of Merlin hit him hard. So he -- er -- accidentally let slip that I am a werewolf this morning at breakfast.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You're not leaving just because of that!\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000Lupin smiled wryly.\n\u3000\u3000\"This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving from parents.... They will not want a werewolf teaching their children, Harry. And after last night, I see their point. I could have bitten any of you.... That must never happen again.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You're the best Defense Against the Dark Arts- teacher we've ever had!\" said Harry. \"Don't go!\"\n\u3000\u3000Lupin shook his head and didn't speak. He carried on emptying his drawers. Then, while Harry was trying to think of a good argument to make him stay, Lupin said, \"From what the headmaster told me this morning, you saved a lot of lives last night, Harry. if I'm proud of anything I've done this year, it's how much you've learned.... Tell me about your Patronus.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"How d'you know about that?\" said Harry, distracted.\n\u3000\u3000\"What else could have driven the dementors back?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry told Lupin what had happened. When he'd finished, Lupin was smiling again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes, your father was always a stag when he transformed,\" he said. \"You guessed right... that's why we called him Prongs.\"\n\u3000\u3000Lupin threw his last few books into his case, closed the desk drawers, and turned to look at Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Here -- I brought this from the Shrieking Shack last night,\" he said, handing Harry back the Invisibility Cloak. \"And...\" He hesitated, then held out the Marauder's Map too. \"I am no longer your teacher, so I don't feel guilty about giving you back this as well. It's no use to me, and I daresay you, Ron, and Hermione will find uses for it.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry took the map and grinned.\n\u3000\u3000\"You told me Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs would've wanted to lure me out of school... you said they'd have thought it was funny.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"And so we would have,\" said Lupin, now reaching down to close his case. \"I have no hesitation in saying that James would have been highly disappointed if his son had never found any of the secret passages out of the castle.\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a knock on the door. Harry hastily stuffed the Marauder's Map and the Invisibility Cloak into his pocket.\n\u3000\u3000It was Professor Dumbledore. He didn't look surprised to see Harry there.\n\u3000\u3000\"Your carriage is at the gates, Remus,\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000\"Thank You, Headmaster.\"\n\u3000\u3000Lupin picked up his old suitcase and the empty grindylow tank.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well -- good-bye, Harry,\" he said, smiling. \"It has been a real pleasure teaching you. I feel sure we'll meet again sometime. Headmaster, there is no need to see me to the gates, I can manage....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry had the impression that Lupin wanted to leave as quickly as possible.\n\u3000\u3000\"Good-bye, then, Remus,\" said Dumbledore soberly. Lupin shifted the grindylow tank slightly so that he and Dumbledore could shake hands. Then, with a final nod to Harry and a swift smile, Lupin left the office.\n\u3000\u3000Harry sat down in his vacated chair, staring glumly at the floor. He heard the door close and looked up. Dumbledore was still there.\n\u3000\u3000\"Why so miserable, Harry?\" he said quietly. \"You should be very proud of yourself after last night.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It didn't make any difference,\" said Harry bitterly. \"Pettigrew got away.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Didn't make any difference?\" said Dumbledore quietly, \"It made all the difference in the world, Harry. You helped uncover the truth. You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate.\"\n\u3000\u3000Terrible. Something stirred in Harry's memory. Greater and more terrible than ever before... Professor Trelawney's prediction!\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor Dumbledore -- yesterday, when I was having my Divination exam, Professor Trelawney went very -- very strange.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Indeed?\" said Dumbledore. \"Er -- stranger than usual, you mean?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes... her voice went all deep and her eyes rolled and she said ... she said Voldemort's servant was going to set out to return to him before midnight.... She said the servant would help him come back to power.\" Harry stared up at Dumbledore. \"And then she sort of became normal again, and she couldn't remember anything she'd said. Was it -- was she making a real prediction?\"\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore looked mildly impressed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Do you know, Harry, I think she might have been.\" he said thoughtfully. \"Who'd have thought it? That brings her total of real predictions up to two. I should offer her a pay raise....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But --\" Harry looked at him, aghast. How could Dumbledore take this so calmly?\n\u3000\u3000\"But -- I stopped Sirius and Professor Lupin from killing Pettigrew! That makes it my fault if Voldemort comes back!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It does not,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"Hasn't your experience with the Time-Turner taught you anything, Harry? The consequences of our actions are always so complicated, so diverse, that predicting the future is a very difficult business indeed.... Professor Trelawney, bless her, is living proof of that.... You did a very noble thing, in saving Pettigrew's life.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But if he helps Voldemort back to power\n\u3000\u3000\"Pettigrew owes his life to you. You have sent Voldemort a deputy who is in your debt.... When one wizard saves another wizard's life, it creates a certain bond between them... and I'm much mistaken if Voldemort wants his servant in the debt of Harry Potter.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't want a connection with Pettigrew!\" said Harry. \"He betrayed my parents!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"This is magic at its deepest, its most impenetrable, Harry. But trust me... the time may come when you will be very glad you saved Pettigrew's life.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry couldn't imagine when that would be. Dumbledore looked as though he knew what Harry was thinking.\n\u3000\u3000\"I knew your father very well, both at Hogwarts and later, Harry,\" he said gently. \"He would have saved Pettigrew too, I am sure of it.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked up at him. Dumbledore wouldn't laugh -- he could tell Dumbledore...\n\u3000\u3000\"I thought it was my dad who'd conjured my Patronus. I mean, when I saw myself across the lake ... I thought I was seeing him.\" \"An easy mistake to make,\" said Dumbledore softly. \"I expect you'll tire of hearing it, but you do look extraordinarily like James. Except for the eyes... you have your mother's eyes.\n\u3000\u3000Harry shook his head.\n\u3000\u3000\"It was stupid, thinking it was him,\" he muttered. \"I mean, I knew he was dead.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You think the dead we loved ever truly leave us? You think that we don't recall them more clearly than ever in times of great trouble? Your father is alive in you, Harry, and shows himself most plainly when you have need of him. How else could you produce that particular Patronus? Prongs rode again last night.\"\n\u3000\u3000It took a moment for Harry to realize what Dumblefore had said.\n\u3000\u3000Last night Sirius told me all about how they became Animagi,\" said Dumbledore, smiling. \"An extraordinary achievement -- not least, keeping it quiet from me. And then I remembered the most unusual form your Patronus took, when it charged Mr. Malfoy down at your Quidditch match against Ravenclaw. You know, Harry, in a way, you did see your father last night.... You found him inside yourself.\"\n\u3000\u3000And Dumbledore left the office, leaving Harry to his very confused thoughts.\n\u3000\u3000Nobody at Hogwarts now knew the truth of what had happened the night that Sirius, Buckbeak, and Pettigrew had vanished except Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Professor Dumbledore. As the end of term approached, Harry heard many different theories about what had really happened, but none of them came close to the truth.\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy was furious about Buckbeak. He was convinced that Hagrid had found a way of smuggling the hippogriff to safety, and seemed outraged that he and his father had been outwitted by a gamekeeper. Percy Weasley, meanwhile, had much to say on the subject of Sirius's escape.\n\u3000\u3000\"If I manage to get into the Ministry, I'll have a lot of proposals to make about Magical Law Enforcement!\" he told the only person who would listen -- his girlfriend, Penelope.\n\u3000\u3000Though the weather was perfect, though the atmosphere was so\n\u3000\u3000cheerful, though he knew they had achieved the near impossible in helping Sirius to freedom, Harry had never approached the end of a school year in worse spirits.\n\u3000\u3000He certainly wasn't the only one who was sorry to see Professor Lupin go. The whole of Harry's Defense Against the Dark Arts class was miserable about his resignation.\n\u3000\u3000\"Wonder what they'll give us next year?\" said Seamus Finnigan gloomily.\n\u3000\u3000\"Maybe a vampire,\" suggested Dean Thomas hopefully.\n\u3000\u3000It wasn't only Professor Lupin's departure that was weighing on Harry's mind. He couldn't help thinking a lot about Professor Trelawney's prediction. He kept wondering where Pettigrew was now, whether he had sought sanctuary with Voldemort yet. But the thing that was lowering Harry's spirits most of all was the prospect of returning to the Dursleys. For maybe half an hour, a glorious half hour, he had believed he would be living with Sirius from now on... his parents' best friend.... It would have been the next best thing to having his own father back. And while no news of Sirius was definitely good news, because it meant he had successfully gone into hiding, Harry couldn't help feeling miserable when he thought of the home he might have had, and the fact that it was now impossible.\n\u3000\u3000The exam results came out on the last day of term. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had passed every subject. Harry was amazed that he had got through Potions. He had a shrewd suspicion that Dumbledore might have stepped in to stop Snape failing him on purpose. Snape's behavior toward Harry over the past week had been quite alarming. Harry wouldn't have thought it possible that Snape's dislike for him could increase, but it certainly had. A muscle twitched unpleasantly at the corner of Snape's thin mouth every time he looked at Harry, and he was constantly flexing his fingers, as though itching to place them around Harry's throat.\n\u3000\u3000Percy had got his top-grade N.E.W.T.s; Fred and George had scraped a handful of O.W.L.s each. Gryffindor House, meanwhile, largely thanks to their spectacular performance in the Quidditch Cup, had won the House championship for the third year running. This meant that the end of term feast took place amid decorations of scarlet and gold, and that the Gryffindor table was the noisiest of the lot, as everybody celebrated. Even Harry managed to forget about the journey back to the Dursleys the next day as he ate, drank, talked, and laughed with the rest.\n\u3000\u3000As the Hogwarts Express pulled out of the station the next mornIng, Hermione gave Harry and Ron some surprising news.\n\u3000\u3000\"I went to see Professor McGonagall this morning, just before breakfast. I've decided to drop Muggle Studies.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But you passed your exam with three hundred and twenty percent!\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"I know,\" sighed Hermione, \"but I can't stand another year like this one. That Time-Turner, it was driving me mad. I've handed it in. Without Muggle Studies and Divination, I'll be able to have a normal schedule again.\"\n\u3000\u3000I still can't believe you didn't tell us about it,\" said Ron grumpily. \"We're supposed to be your friends.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I promised I wouldn't tell anyone,\" said Hermione severely. She looked around at Harry, who was watching Hogwarts disappear from view behind a mountain. Two whole months before he'd see it again....\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, cheer up, Harry!\" said Hermione sadly.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm okay,\" said Harry quickly. \"Just thinking about the holidays.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, I've been thinking about them too,\" said Ron. \"Harry, you've got to come and stay with us. I'll fix it up with Mum and Dad, then I'll call you. I know how to use a fellytone now --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"A telephone, Ron,\" said Hermione. \"Honestly, you should take Muggle Studies next year....\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron *ignored her.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's the Quidditch World Cup this summer! How about it, Harry? Come and stay, and we'll go and see it! Dad can usually get tickets from work.\"\n\u3000\u3000This proposal had the effect of cheering Harry up a great deal.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah... I bet the Dursleys'd be pleased to let me come... especially after what I did to Aunt Marge....\"\n\u3000\u3000Feeling considerably more cheerful, Harry joined Ron and Hermione in several games of Exploding Snap, and when the witch with the tea cart arrived, he bought himself a very large lunch, though nothing with chocolate in it.\n\u3000\u3000But it was late in the afternoon before the thing that made him truly happy turned up....\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry,\" said Hermione suddenly, peering over his shoulder. \"What's that thing outside your window?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry turned to look outside. Something very small and gray was bobbing in and out of sight beyond the glass. He stood up for a better look and saw that it was a tiny owl, carrying a letter that was much too big for it. The owl was so small, in fact, that it kept tumbling over in the air, buffeted this way and that in the train's slipstream. Harry quickly pulled down the window, stretched out his arm, and caught it. It felt like a very fluffy Snitch. He brought it carefully inside. The owl dropped its letter onto Harry's seat and began zooming around their compartment, apparently very pleased with itself for accomplishing its task. Hedwig clicked her beak with a sort of dignified disapproval. Crookshanks sat up in his seat, following the owl with his great yellow eyes. Ron, noticing this, snatched the owl safely out of harm's way.\n\u3000\u3000Harry picked up the letter. It was addressed to him. He ripped open the letter, and shouted, \"It's from Sirius!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" said Ron and Hermione excitedly. \"Read it aloud!\"\n\u3000\u3000Dear Harry,\n\u3000\u3000I hope this finds you before you reach your aunt and uncle. I don't know whether they're used to owl post.\n\u3000\u3000Buckbeak and I are in hiding. I won't tell you where, in case this owl falls into the wrong hands. I have some doubt about his reliability, but he is the best I could find, and he did seem eager for the job.\n\u3000\u3000I believe the dementors are still searching for me, but they haven't a hope of finding me here. I am planning to allow some Muggles to glimpse me soon, a long way from Hogwarts, so that the security on the castle will be lifted.\n\u3000\u3000There is something I never got around to telling you during our brief meeting. It was I who sent you the Firebolt --\n\u3000\u3000\"Ha!\" said Hermione triumphantly. \"See! I told you it was from him!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes, but he hadn't jinxed it, had he?\" said Ron. \"Ouch!\" The tiny owl, now hooting happily in his hand, had nibbled one of his fingers in what it seemed to think was an affectionate way.\n\u3000\u3000Crookshanks took the order to the Owl Office for me. I used your name but told them to take the gold from my own Gringotts vault. Please consider it as thirteen birthdays' worth of presents from your godfather.\n\u3000\u3000I would also like to apologize for the fright I think I gave you that night last year when you left your uncle's house. I had only hoped to get a glimpse of you before starting my journey north, but I think the sight of me alarmed you.\n\u3000\u3000I am enclosing something else for you, which I think will make your next year at Hogwarts more enjoyable.\n\u3000\u3000If ever you need me, send word. Your owl will find me.\n\u3000\u3000I'll write again soon.\n\u3000\u3000Sirius\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked eagerly inside the envelope. There was another piece of parchment in there. He read it through quickly and felt suddenly as warm and contented as though he'd swallowed a bottle of hot butterbeer in one gulp.\n\u3000\u3000I, Sirius Black, Harry Potter's godfather, hereby give him permission to visit Hogsmeade on weekends.\n\u3000\u3000\"That'll be good enough for Dumbledore!\" said Harry happily. He looked back at Sirius's letter. \"Hang on, there's a RS....\"\n\u3000\u3000I thought your ftiend Ron might like to keep this owl, as it's my fault he no longer has a rat.\n\u3000\u3000Ron's eyes widened. The minute owl was still hooting excitedly. \"Keep him?\" he said uncertainly. He looked closely at the owl for a moment; then, to Harry's and Hermione's great surprise, he held him out for Crookshanks to sniff.\n\u3000\u3000\"What do you reckon?\" Ron asked the cat. \"Definitely an owl?\"\n\u3000\u3000Crookshanks purred.\n\u3000\u3000\"That's good enough for me,\" said Ron happily. \"He's mine.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry read and reread the letter from Sirius all the way back into King's Cross station. It was still clutched tightly in his hand as he, Ron, and Hermione stepped back through the barrier of platform nine an(' three-quarters. Harry spotted Uncle Vernon at once. He was standing a good distance from Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, eyeing them suspiciously, and when Mrs. Weasley hugged Harry in greeting, his worst suspicions about them seemed confirmed.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll call about the World Cup!\" Ron yelled after Harry as Harry bid him and Hermione good-bye, then wheeled the trolley bearing his trunk and Hedwig's cage toward Uncle Vernon, who greeted him in his usual fashion.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's that?\" he snarled, staring at the envelope Harry was still clutching in his hand. \"If it's another form for me to sign, you've got another ---\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It's not,\" said Harry cheerfully. \"It's a letter from my godfather.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Godfather?\" sputtered Uncle Vernon. \"You haven't got a godfather!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes, I have,\" said Harry brightly. \"He was my mum and dad's best friend. He's a convicted murderer, but he's broken out of wizard prison and he's on the run. He likes to keep in touch with me, though... keep up with my news... check if I'm happy...\"\n\u3000\u3000And, grinning broadly at the look of horror on Uncle Vernon's face, Harry set off toward the station exit, Hedwig rattling along in front of him, for what looked like a much better summer than the last.\n\u3000\u3000THE END \n", "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \nBy J. K. Rowling \n\n\f\n Chapter One \nThe Dark Lord Ascending \n\n\nThe two men appeared out of nowhere, a few yards apart in the narrow, moonlit \nlane. For a second they stood quite still, wands directed at each other's chests; then, \nrecognizing each other, they stowed their wands beneath their cloaks and started walking \nbriskly in the same direction. \n\"News?\" asked the taller of the two. \n\"The best,\" replied Severus Snape. \nThe lane was bordered on the left by wild, low-growing brambles, on the right by a high, \nneatly manicured hedge. The men's long cloaks flapped around their ankles as they \nmarched. \n\"Thought I might be late,\" said Yaxley, his blunt features sliding in and out of sight as \nthe branches of overhanging trees broke the moonlight. \"It was a little trickier than I \nexpected. But I hope he will be satisfied. You sound confident that your reception will be \ngood?\" \nSnape nodded, but did not elaborate. They turned right, into a wide driveway that led \noff the lane. The high hedge curved into them, running off into the distance beyond the \npair of imposing wrought-iron gates barring the men\u2019s way. Neither of them broke step: \nIn silence both raised their left arms in a kind of salute and passed straight through, as \nthough the dark metal was smoke. \n\n The yew hedges muffled the sound of the men\u2019s footsteps. There was a rustle \nsomewhere to their right: Yaxley drew his wand again pointing it over his companion\u2019s \nhead, but the source of the noise proved to be nothing more than a pure-white peacock, \nstrutting majestically along the top of the hedge. \n\n \u201cHe always did himself well, Lucius. Peacocks \u2026\u201d Yaxley thrust his wand back \nunder his cloak with a snort. \n\n A handsome manor house grew out of the darkness at the end of the straight drive, \nlights glinting in the diamond paned downstairs windows. Somewhere in the dark garden \nbeyond the hedge a fountain was playing. Gravel crackled beneath their feet as Snape and \nYaxley sped toward the front door, which swung inward at their approach, though \nnobody had visibly opened it. \n\n The hallway was large, dimly lit, and sumptuously decorated, with a magnificent \ncarpet covering most of the stone floor. The eyes of the pale-faced portraits on the wall \nfollowed Snape and Yaxley as they strode past. The two men halted at a heavy wooden \ndoor leading into the next room, hesitated for the space of a heartbeat, then Snape turned \nthe bronze handle. \n\n The drawing room was full of silent people, sitting at a long and ornate table. The \nroom\u2019s usual furniture had been pushed carelessly up against the walls. Illumination \ncame from a roaring fire beneath a handsome marble mantelpiece surmounted by a gilded \nmirror. Snape and Yaxley lingered for a moment on the threshold. As their eyes grew \naccustomed to the lack of light, they were drawn upward to the strangest feature of the \nscene: an apparently unconscious human figure hanging upside down over the table, \nrevolving slowly as if suspended by an invisible rope, and reflected in the mirror and in \nthe bare, polished surface of the table below. None of the people seated underneath this \n\n\f\nsingular sight were looking at it except for a pale young man sitting almost directly below \nit. He seemed unable to prevent himself from glancing upward every minute or so. \n\n \u201cYaxley. Snape,\u201d said a high, clear voice from the head of the table. \u201cYou are \nvery nearly late.\u201d \n\n The speaker was seated directly in front of the fireplace, so that it was difficult, at \nfirst, for the new arrivals to make out more than his silhouette. As they drew nearer, \nhowever, his face shone through the gloom, hairless, snakelike, with slits for nostrils and \ngleaming red eyes whose pupils were vertical. He was so pale that he seemed to emit a \npearly glow. \n\n \u201cSeverus, here,\u201d said Voldemort, indicating the seat on his immediate right. \n\u201cYaxley \u2013 beside Dolohov.\u201d \n\n The two men took their allotted places. Most of the eyes around the table \nfollowed Snape, and it was to him that Voldemort spoke first. \n\n \u201cSo?\u201d \n\n \u201cMy Lord, the Order of the Phoenix intends to move Harry Potter from his current \nplace of safety on Saturday next, at nightfall.\u201d \n\n The interest around the table sharpened palpably: Some stiffened, others fidgeted, \nall gazing at Snape and Voldemort. \n\n \u201cSaturday \u2026 at nightfall,\u201d repeated Voldemort. His red eyes fastened upon \nSnape\u2019s black ones with such intensity that some of the watchers looked away, apparently \nfearful that they themselves would be scorched by the ferocity of the gaze. Snape, \nhowever, looked calmly back into Voldemort\u2019s face and, after a moment or two, \nVoldemort\u2019s lipless mouth curved into something like a smile. \n\n \u201cGood. Very good. And this information comes \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201c \u2013 from the source we discussed,\u201d said Snape. \n\n \u201cMy Lord.\u201d \n\n Yaxley had leaned forward to look down the long table at Voldemort and Snape. \nAll faces turned to him. \n\n \u201cMy Lord, I have heard differently.\u201d \n\n Yaxley waited, but Voldemort did not speak, so he went on, \u201cDawlish, the Auror, \nlet slip that Potter will not be moved until the thirtieth, the night before the boy turns \nseventeen.\u201d \n\n Snape was smiling. \n\n \u201cMy source told me that there are plans to lay a false trail; this must be it. No \ndoubt a Confundus Charm has been placed upon Dawlish. It would not be the first time; \nhe is known to be susceptible.\u201d \n\n \u201cI assure you, my Lord, Dawlish seemed quite certain,\u201d said Yaxley. \n\n \u201cIf he has been Confunded, naturally he is certain,\u201d said Snape. \u201cI assure you, \nYaxley, the Auror Office will play no further part in the protection of Harry Potter. The \nOrder believes that we have infiltrated the Ministry.\u201d \n\n \u201cThe Order\u2019s got one thing right, then, eh?\u201d said a squat man sitting a short \ndistance from Yaxley; he gave a wheezy giggle that was echoed here and there along the \ntable. \n\n Voldemort did not laugh. His gaze had wandered upward to the body revolving \nslowly overhead, and he seemed to be lost in thought. \n\n\f\n \u201cMy Lord,\u201d Yaxley went on, \u201cDawlish believes an entire party of Aurors will be \nused to transfer the boy \u2013\u201c \n\n Voldemort held up a large white hand, and Yaxley subsided at once, watching \nresentfully as Voldemort turned back to Snape. \n\n \u201cWhere are they going to hide the boy next?\u201d \n\n \u201cAt the home of one of the Order,\u201d said Snape. \u201cThe place, according to the \nsource, has been given every protection that the Order and Ministry together could \nprovide. I think that there is little chance of taking him once he is there, my Lord, unless, \nof course, the Ministry has fallen before next Saturday, which might give us the \nopportunity to discover and undo enough of the enchantments to break through the rest.\u201d \n\n \u201cWell, Yaxley?\u201d Voldemort called down the table, the firelight glinting strangely \nin his red eyes. \u201cWill the Ministry have fallen by next Saturday?\u201d \n\n Once again, all heads turned. Yaxley squared his shoulders. \n\n \u201cMy Lord, I have good news on that score. I have \u2013 with difficulty, and after great \neffort \u2013 succeeded in placing an Imperius Curse upon Pius Thicknesse.\u201d \n\n Many of those sitting around Yaxley looked impressed; his neighbor, Dolohov, a \nman with a long, twisted face, clapped him on the back. \n\n \u201cIt is a start,\u201d said Voldemort. \u201cBut Thicknesse is only one man. Scrimgeour must \nbe surrounded by our people before I act. One failed attempt on the Minister\u2019s life will \nset me back a long way.\u201d \n\n \u201cYes \u2013 my Lord, that is true \u2013 but you know, as Head of the Department of \nMagical Law Enforcement, Thicknesse has regular contact not only with the Minister \nhimself, but also with the Heads of all the other Ministry departments. It will, I think, be \neasy now that we have such a high-ranking official under our control, to subjugate the \nothers, and then they can all work together to bring Scrimgeour down.\u201d \n\n \u201cAs long as our friend Thicknesse is not discovered before he has converted the \nrest,\u201d said Voldemort. \u201cAt any rate, it remains unlikely that the Ministry will be mine \nbefore next Saturday. If we cannot touch the boy at his destination, then it must be done \nwhile he travels.\u201d \n\n \u201cWe are at an advantage there, my Lord,\u201d said Yaxley, who seemed determined to \nreceive some portion of approval. \u201cWe now have several people planted within the \nDepartment of Magical Transport. If Potter Apparates or uses the Floo Network, we shall \nknow immediately.\u201d \n\n \u201cHe will not do either,\u201d said Snape. \u201cThe Order is eschewing any form of \ntransport that is controlled or regulated by the Ministry; they mistrust everything to do \nwith the place.\u201d \n\n \u201cAll the better,\u201d said Voldemort. \u201cHe will have to move in the open. Easier to \ntake, by far.\u201d \n\n Again, Voldemort looked up at the slowly revolving body as he went on, \u201cI shall \nattend to the boy in person. There have been too many mistakes where Harry Potter is \nconcerned. Some of them have been my own. That Potter lives is due more to my errors \nthan to his triumphs.\u201d \n\n The company around the table watched Voldemort apprehensively, each of them, \nby his or her expression, afraid that they might be blamed for Harry Potter\u2019s continued \nexistence. Voldemort, however, seemed to be speaking more to himself than to any of \nthem, still addressing the unconscious body above him. \n\n\f\n \u201cI have been careless, and so have been thwarted by luck and chance, those \nwreckers of all but the best-laid plans. But I know better now. I understand those things \nthat I did not understand before. I must be the one to kill Harry Potter, and I shall be.\u201d \n\n At these words, seemingly in response to them, a sudden wail sounded, a terrible, \ndrawn-out cry of misery and pain. Many of those at the table looked downward, startled, \nfor the sound had seemed to issue from below their feet. \n\n \u201cWormtail,\u201d said Voldemort, with no change in his quiet, thoughtful tone, and \nwithout removing his eyes from the revolving body above, \u201chave I not spoken to you \nabout keeping our prisoner quiet?\u201d \n\n \u201cYes, m-my Lord,\u201d gasped a small man halfway down the table, who had been \nsitting so low in his chair that it appeared, at first glance, to be unoccupied. Now he \nscrambled from his seat and scurried from the room, leaving nothing behind him but a \ncurious gleam of silver. \n\n \u201cAs I was saying,\u201d continued Voldemort, looking again at the tense faces of his \nfollowers, \u201cI understand better now. I shall need, for instance, to borrow a wand from one \nof you before I go to kill Potter.\u201d \n\n The faces around him displayed nothing but shock; he might have announced that \nhe wanted to borrow one of their arms. \n\n \u201cNo volunteers?\u201d said Voldemort. \u201cLet\u2019s see \u2026 Lucius, I see no reason for you to \nhave a wand anymore.\u201d \n\n Lucius Malfoy looked up. His skin appeared yellowish and waxy in the firelight, \nand his eyes were sunken and shadowed. When he spoke, his voice was hoarse. \n\n \u201cMy Lord?\u201d \n\n \u201cYour wand, Lucius. I require your wand.\u201d \n\n \u201cI \u2026\u201d \n\n Malfoy glanced sideways at his wife. She was staring straight ahead, quite as pale \nas he was, her long blonde hair hanging down her back, but beneath the table her slim \nfingers closed briefly on his wrist. At her touch, Malfoy put his hand into his robes, \nwithdrew a wand, and passed it along to Voldemort, who held it up in front of his red \neyes, examining it closely. \n\n \u201cWhat is it?\u201d \n\n \u201cElm, my Lord,\u201d whispered Malfoy. \n\n \u201cAnd the core?\u201d \n\n \u201cDragon \u2013 dragon heartstring.\u201d \n\n \u201cGood,\u201d said Voldemort. He drew out his wand and compared the lengths. Lucius \nMalfoy made an involuntary movement; for a fraction of a second, it seemed he expected \nto receive Voldemort\u2019s wand in exchange for his own. The gesture was not missed by \nVoldemort, whose eyes widened maliciously. \n\n \u201cGive you my wand, Lucius? My wand?\u201d \n\n Some of the throng sniggered. \n\n \u201cI have given you your liberty, Lucius, is that not enough for you? But I have \nnoticed that you and your family seem less than happy of late \u2026 What is it about my \npresence in your home that displaces you, Lucius?\u201d \n\n \u201cNothing \u2013 nothing, my Lord!\u201d \n\n \u201cSuch lies Lucius \u2026 \u201c \n\n\f\n The soft voice seemed to hiss on even after the cruel mouth had stopped moving. \nOne or two of the wizards barely repressed a shudder as the hissing grew louder; \nsomething heavy could be heard sliding across the floor beneath the table. \n\n The huge snake emerged to climb slowly up Voldemort\u2019s chair. It rose, seemingly \nendlessly, and came to rest across Voldemort\u2019s shoulders: its neck the thickness of a \nman\u2019s thigh; its eyes, with their vertical slits for pupils, unblinking. Voldemort stroked \nthe creature absently with long thin fingers, still looking at Lucius Malfoy. \n\n \u201cWhy do the Malfoys look so unhappy with their lot? Is my return, my rise to \npower, not the very thing they professed to desire for so many years?\u201d \n\n \u201cOf course, my Lord,\u201d said Lucius Malfoy. His hand shook as he wiped sweat \nfrom his upper lip. \u201cWe did desire it \u2013 we do.\u201d \n\n To Malfoy\u2019s left, his wife made an odd, stiff nod, her eyes averted from \nVoldemort and the snake. To his right, his son, Draco, who had been gazing up at the \ninert body overhead, glanced quickly at Voldemort and away again, terrified to make eye \ncontact. \n\n \u201cMy Lord,\u201d said a dark woman halfway down the table, her voice constricted with \nemotion, \u201cit is an honor to have you here, in our family\u2019s house. There can be no higher \npleasure.\u201d \n\n She sat beside her sister, as unlike her in looks, with her dark hair and heavily \nlidded eyes, as she was in bearing and demeanor; where Narcissa sat rigid and impassive, \nBellatrix leaned toward Voldemort, for mere words could not demonstrate her longing for \ncloseness. \n\n \u201cNo higher pleasure,\u201d repeated Voldemort, his head tilted a little to one side as he \nconsidered Bellatrix. \u201cThat means a great deal, Bellatrix, from you.\u201d \n\n Her face flooded with color; her eyes welled with tears of delight. \n\n \u201cMy Lord knows I speak nothing but the truth!\u201d \n\n \u201cNo higher pleasure \u2026 even compared with the happy event that, I hear, has \ntaken place in your family this week?\u201d \n\n She stared at him, her lips parted, evidently confused. \n\n \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean, my Lord.\u201d \n\n \u201cI\u2019m talking about your niece, Bellatrix. And yours, Lucius and Narcissa. She has \njust married the werewolf, Remus Lupin. You must be so proud.\u201d \n\n There was an eruption of jeering laughter from around the table. Many leaned \nforward to exchange gleeful looks; a few thumped the table with their fists. The giant \nsnake, disliking the disturbance, opened its mouth wide and hissed angrily, but the Death \nEaters did not hear it, so jubilant were they at Bellatrix and the Malfoys\u2019 humiliation. \nBellatrix\u2019s face, so recently flushed wit happiness, had turned an ugly, blotchy red. \n\n \u201cShe is no niece of ours, my Lord,\u201d she cried over the outpouring of mirth. \u201cWe \u2013 \nNarcissa and I \u2013 have never set eyes on our sister since she married the Mudblood. This \nbrat has nothing to do with either of us, nor any beast she marries.\u201d \n\n \u201cWhat say you, Draco?\u201d asked Voldemort, and though his voice was quiet, it \ncarried clearly through the catcalls and jeers. \u201cWill you babysit the cubs?\u201d \n\n The hilarity mounted; Draco Malfoy looked in terror at his father, who was \nstaring down into his own lap, then caught his mother\u2019s eye. She shook her head almost \nimperceptibly, then resumed her own deadpan stare at the opposite wall. \n\n \u201cEnough,\u201d said Voldemort, stroking the angry snake. \u201cEnough.\u201d \n\n\f\n And the laughter died at once. \n\n \u201cMany of our oldest family trees become a little diseased over time,\u201d he said as \nBellatrix gazed at him, breathless and imploring, \u201cYou must prune yours, must you not, \nto keep it healthy? Cut away those parts that threaten the health of the rest.\u201d \n\n \u201cYes, my Lord,\u201d whispered Bellatrix, and her eyes swam with tears of gratitude \nagain. \u201cAt the first chance!\u201d \n\n \u201cYou shall have it,\u201d said Voldemort. \u201cAnd in your family, so in the world \u2026 we \nshall cut away the canker that infects us until only those of the true blood remain \u2026\u201d \n\n Voldemort raised Lucius Malfoy\u2019s wand, pointed it directly at the slowly \nrevolving figure suspended over the table, and gave it a tiny flick. The figure came to life \nwith a groan and began to struggle against invisible bonds. \n\n \u201cDo you recognize our guest, Severus?\u201d asked Voldemort. \n\n Snape raised his eyes to the upside down face. All of the Death Eaters were \nlooking up at the captive now, as though they had been given permission to show \ncuriosity. As she revolved to face the firelight, the woman said in a cracked and terrified \nvoice, \u201cSeverus! Help me!\u201d \n\n \u201cAh, yes,\u201d said Snape as the prisoner turned slowly away again. \n\n \u201cAnd you, Draco?\u201d asked Voldemort, stroking the snake\u2019s snout with his wand-\nfree hand. Draco shook his head jerkily. Now that the woman had woken, he seemed \nunable to look at her anymore. \n\n \u201cBut you would not have taken her classes,\u201d said Voldemort. \u201cFor those of you \nwho do not know, we are joined here tonight by Charity Burbage who, until recently, \ntaught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\u201d \n\n There were small noises of comprehension around the table. A broad, hunched \nwoman with pointed teeth cackled. \n\n \u201cYes \u2026 Professor Burbage taught the children of witches and wizards all about \nMuggles \u2026 how they are not so different from us \u2026 \u201c \n\n One of the Death Eaters spat on the floor. Charity Burbage revolved to face Snape \nagain. \n\n \u201cSeverus \u2026 please \u2026 please \u2026 \u201c \n\n \u201cSilence,\u201d said Voldemort, with another twitch of Malfoy\u2019s wand, and Charity fell \nsilent as if gagged. \u201cNot content with corrupting and polluting the minds of Wizarding \nchildren, last week Professor Burbage wrote an impassioned defense of Mudbloods in the \nDaily Prophet. Wizards, she says, must accept these thieves of their knowledge and \nmagic. The dwindling of the purebloods is, says Professor Burbage, a most desirable \ncircumstance \u2026 She would have us all mate with Muggles \u2026 or, no doubt, werewolves \n\u2026 \u201c \n\n Nobody laughed this time. There was no mistaking the anger and contempt in \nVoldemort\u2019s voice. For the third time, Charity Burbage revolved to face Snape. Tears \nwere pouring from her eyes into her hair. Snape looked back at her, quite impassive, as \nshe turned slowly away from him again. \n\n \u201cAvada Kedavra\u201d \n\n The flash of green light illuminated every corner of the room. Charity fell, with a \nresounding crash, onto the table below, which trembled and creaked. Several of the Death \nEaters leapt back in their chairs. Draco fell out of his onto the floor. \n\n\f\n \u201cDinner, Nagini,\u201d said Voldemort softly, and the great snake swayed and slithered \nfrom his shoulders onto the polished wood. \n\n \n\nChapter Two \n\nIn Memorandum \n\n \n\nHarry was bleeding. Clutching his right hand in his left and swearing under his \nbreath, he shouldered open his bedroom door. There was a crunch of breaking china. He \nhad trodden on a cup of cold tea that had been sitting on the floor outside his bedroom \ndoor. \n\n \"What the --?\" \n\n He looked around, the landing of number four, Privet Drive, was deserted. \nPossibly the cup of tea was Dudley's idea of a clever booby trap. Keeping his bleeding \nhand elevated, Harry scraped the fragments of cup together with the other hand and threw \nthem into the already crammed bin just visible inside his bedroom door. Then he tramped \nacross to the bathroom to run his finger under the tap. \n\n It was stupid, pointless, irritating beyond belief that he still had four days left of \nbeing unable to perform magic\u2026but he had to admit to himself that this jagged cut in his \nfinger would have defeated him. He had never learned how to repair wounds, and now he \ncame to think of it \u2013 particularly in light of his immediate plans \u2013 this seemed a serious \nflaw in his magical education. Making a mental note to ask Hermione how it was done, \nhe used a large wad of toilet paper to mop up as much of the tea as he could before \nreturning to his bedroom and slamming the door behind him. \n\n Harry had spent the morning completely emptying his school trunk for the first \ntime since he had packed it six years ago. At the start of the intervening school years, he \nhad merely skimmed off the topmost three quarters of the contents and replaced or \nupdated them, leaving a layer of general debris at the bottom \u2013 old quills, desiccated \nbeetle eyes, single socks that no longer fit. Minutes previously, Harry had plunged his \nhand into this mulch, experienced a stabbing pain in the fourth finger of his right hand, \nand withdrawn it to see a lot of blood. \n\n He now proceeded a little more cautiously. Kneeling down beside the trunk again, \nhe groped around in the bottom and, after retrieving an old badge that flickered feebly \nbetween SUPPORT CEDRIC DIGGORY and POTTER STINKS, a cracked and worn-out \nSneakoscope, and a gold locket inside which a note signed R.A.B. had been hidden, he \nfinally discovered the sharp edge that had done the damage. He recognized it at once. It \nwas a two-inch-long fragment of the enchanted mirror that his dead godfather, Sirius, had \ngiven him. Harry laid it aside and felt cautiously around the trunk for the rest, but nothing \n\n\f\nmore remained of his godfather's last gift except powdered glass, which clung to the \ndeepest layer of debris like glittering grit. \n\n Harry sat up and examined the jagged piece on which he had cut himself, seeing \nnothing but his own bright green eye reflected back at him. Then he placed the fragment \non top of that morning's Daily prophet, which lay unread on the bed, and attempted to \nstem the sudden upsurge of bitter memories, the stabs of regret and of longing the \ndiscovery of the broken mirror had occasioned, by attacking the rest of the rubbish in the \ntrunk. \n\n It took another hour to empty it completely, throw away the useless items, and \nsort the remainder in piles according to whether or not he would need them from now on. \nHis school and Quidditch robes, cauldron, parchment, quills, and most of his textbooks \nwere piled in a corner, to be left behind. He wondered what his aunt and uncle would do \nwith them; burn them in the dead of night, probably, as if they were evidence of some \ndreadful crime. His Muggle clothing, Invisibility Cloak, potion-making kit, certain books, \nthe photograph album Hagrid had once given him, a stack of letters, and his wand had \nbeen repacked into an old rucksack. In a front pocket were the Marauder's Map and the \nlocket with the note signed R.A.B. inside it. The locket was accorded this place of honor \nnot because it was valuable \u2013 in all usual senses it was worthless \u2013 but because of what it \nhad cost to attain it. \n\n This left a sizable stack of newspapers sitting on his desk beside his snowy owl, \nHedwig: one for each of the days Harry had spent at Privet Drive this summer. \n\n He got up off the floor, stretched, and moved across to his desk. Hedwig made no \nmovement as he began to flick through newspapers, throwing them into the rubbish pile \none by one. The owl was asleep or else faking; she was angry with Harry about the \nlimited amount of time she was allowed out of her cage at the moment. \n\n As he neared the bottom of the pile of newspapers, Harry slowed down, searching \nfor one particular issue that he knew had arrived shortly after he had returned to Privet \nDrive for the summer; he remembered that there had been a small mention on the front \nabout the resignation of Charity Burbage, the Muggle Studies teacher at Hogwarts. At \nlast he found it. Turning to page ten, he sank into his desk chair and reread the article he \nhad been looking for. \n\n \n\n ALBUS DUMBLEDORE REMEMBERED \n\n By Elphias Doge \n\nI met Albus Dumbledore at the age of eleven, on our first day at Hogwarts. Our \nmutual attraction was undoubtedly due to the fact that we both felt ourselves to be \noutsiders. I had contracted dragon pox shortly before arriving at school, and while \n\n\f\nI was no longer contagious, my pock-marked visage and greenish hue did not \nencourage many to approach me. For his part, Albus had arrived at Hogwarts \nunder the burden of unwanted notoriety. Scarcely a year previously, his father, \nPercival, had been convicted of a savage and well-publicized attack upon three \nyoung Muggles. \n\nAlbus never attempted to deny that his father (who was to die in Azkaban) had \ncommitted this crime; on the contrary, when I plucked up courage to ask him, he \nassured me that he knew his father to be guilty. Beyond that, Dumbledore refused \nto speak of the sad business, though many attempted to make him do so. Some, \nindeed, were disposed to praise his father's action and assumed that Albus too was \na Muggle-hater. They could not have been more mistaken: As anybody who knew \nAlbus would attest, he never revealed the remotest anti-Muggle tendency. Indeed, \nhis determined support for Muggle rights gained him many enemies in subsequent \nyears. \n\nIn a matter of months, however, Albus's own fame had begun to eclipse that \nof his father. By the end of his first year he would never again be known as the \nson of a Muggle-hater, but as nothing more or less than the most brilliant student \never seen at the school. Those of us who were privileged to be his friends \nbenefited from his example, not to mention his help and encouragement, with \nwhich he was always generous. He confessed to me later in life that he knew even \nthen that his greatest pleasure lay in teaching. \n\nHe not only won every prize of note that the school offered, he was soon in \nregular correspondence with the most notable magical names of the day, including \nNicolas Flamel, the celebrated alchemist; Bathilda Bagshot, the noted historian; \nand Adalbert Waffling, the magical theoretician. Several of his papers found their \nway into learned publications such as Transfiguration Today, Challenges in \nCharming, and The Practical Potioneer. Dumbledore's future career seemed \nlikely to be meteoric, and the only question that remained was when he would \nbecome Minister of Magic. Though it was often predicted in later years that he \nwas on the point of taking the job, however, he never had Ministerial ambitions. \n\nThree years after we had started at Hogwarts, Albus's brother, Aberforth, \narrived at school. They were not alike: Aberforth was never bookish and, unlike \nAlbus, preferred to settle arguments by dueling rather than through reasoned \ndiscussion. However, it is quite wrong to suggest, as some have, that the brothers \nwere not friends. They rubbed along as comfortably as two such different boys \ncould do. In fairness to Aberforth, it must be admitted that living in Albus's \nshadow cannot have been an altogether comfortable experience. Being continually \noutshone was an occupational hazard of being his friend and cannot have been \nany more pleasurable as a brother. When Albus and I left Hogwarts we intended \nto take the then-traditional tour of the world together, visiting and observing \nforeign wizards, before pursuing our separate careers. However, tragedy \nintervened. On the very eve of our trip, Albus's mother, Kendra, died, leaving \n\n\f\nAlbus the head, and sole breadwinner, of the family. I postponed my departure \nlong enough to pay my respects at Kendra's funeral, then left for what was now to \nbe a solitary journey. With a younger brother and sister to care for, and little gold \nleft to them, there could no longer be any question of Albus accompanying me. \n\nThat was the period of our lives when we had least contact. I wrote to Albus, \ndescribing, perhaps insensitively, the wonders of my journey, from narrow \nescapes from chimaeras in Greece to the experiments of the Egyptian alchemists. \nHis letters told me little of his day-to-day life, which I guessed to be frustratingly \ndull for such a brilliant wizard. Immersed in my own experiences, it was with \nhorror that I heard, toward the end of my year's travels, that another tragedy had \nstruck the Dumbledores: the death of his sister, Ariana. \n\nThough Ariana had been in poor health for a long time, the blow, coming so \nsoon after the loss of their mother, had a profound effect on both of her brothers. \nAll those closest to Albus \u2013 and I count myself one of that lucky number \u2013 agree \nthat Ariana's death, and Albus's feeling of personal responsibility for it (though, of \ncourse, he was guiltless), left their mark upon him forevermore. \n\nI returned home to find a young man who had experienced a much older \nperson's suffering. Albus was more reserved than before, and much less light-\nhearted. To add to his misery, the loss of Ariana had led, not to a renewed \ncloseness between Albus and Aberforth, but to an estrangement. (In time this \nwould lift \u2013 in later years they reestablished, if not a close relationship, then \ncertainly a cordial one.) However, he rarely spoke of his parents or of Ariana from \nthen on, and his friends learned not to mention them. \n\nOther quills will describe the triumphs of the following years. Dumbledore's \ninnumerable contributions to the store of Wizarding knowledge, including his \ndiscovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, will benefit generations to come, \nas will the wisdom he displayed in the many judgments while Chief Warlock of \nthe Wizengamot. They say, still, that no Wizarding duel ever matched that \nbetween Dumbledore and Grindelwald in 1945. Those who witnessed it have \nwritten of the terror and the awe they felt as they watched these two extraordinary \nwizards to battle. Dumbledore's triumph, and its consequences for the Wizarding \nworld, are considered a turning point in magical history to match the introduction \nof the International Statute of Secrecy or the downfall of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-\nNamed. \n\nAlbus Dumbledore was never proud or vain; he could find something to value \nin anyone, however apparently insignificant or wretched, and I believe that his \nearly losses endowed him with great humanity and sympathy. I shall miss his \nfriendship more than I can say, but my loss is nothing compared to the Wizarding \nworld's. That he was the most inspiring and best loved of all Hogwarts \nheadmasters cannot be in question. He died as he lived: working always for the \n\n\f\ngreater good and, to his last hour, as willing to stretch out a hand to a small boy \nwith dragon pox as he was on the day I met him. \n\n \n\n Harry finished reading, but continued to gaze at the picture accompanying the \nobituary. Dumbledore was wearing his familiar, kindly smile, but as he peered over the \ntop of his half-moon spectacles, he gave the impression, even in newsprint, of X-raying \nHarry, whose sadness mingled with a sense of humiliation. \n\n He had thought he knew Dumbledore quite well, but ever since reading this \nobituary he had been forced to recognize that he had barely known him at all. Never once \nhad he imagined Dumbledore's childhood or youth; it was as though he had sprung into \nbeing as Harry had known him, venerable and silver-haired and old. The idea of a \nteenage Dumbledore was simply odd, like trying to imagine a stupid Hermione or a \nfriendly Blast-Ended Skrewt. \n\n He had never thought to ask Dumbledore about his past. No doubt it would have \nfelt strange, impertinent even, but after all it had been common knowledge that \nDumbledore had taken part in that legendary duel with Grindelwald, and Harry had not \nthought to ask Dumbledore what that had been like, nor about any of his other famous \nachievements. No, they had always discussed Harry, Harry's past, Harry's future, Harry's \nplans\u2026 and it seemed to Harry now, despite the fact that his future was so dangerous and \nso uncertain, that he had missed irreplaceable opportunities when he had failed to ask \nDumbledore more about himself, even though the only personal question he had ever \nasked his headmaster was also the only one he suspected that Dumbledore had not \nanswered honestly: \n\n \"What do you see when you look in the mirror?\" \n\n \"I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.\" \n\n After several minutes' thought, Harry tore the obituary out of the Prophet, folded \nit carefully, and tucked it inside the first volume of Practical Defensive Magic and its \nUse against the Dark Arts. Then he threw the rest of the newspaper onto the rubbish pile \nand turned to face the room. It was much tidier. The only things left out of place were \ntoday's Daily Prophet, still lying on the bed, and on top of it, the piece of broken mirror. \n\n Harry moved across the room, slid the mirror fragment off today's Prophet, and \nunfolded the newspaper. He had merely glanced at the headline when he had taken the \nrolled-up paper from the delivery owl early that morning and thrown it aside, after noting \nthat it said nothing about Voldemort. Harry was sure that the Ministry was leaning on the \nProphet to suppress news about Voldemort. It was only now, therefore, that he saw what \nhe had missed. \n\n\f\n Across the bottom half of the front page a smaller headline was set over a picture \nof Dumbledore striding along, looking harried: \n\n \n\n DUMBLEDORE \u2013 THE TRUTH AT LAST? \n\nComing next week, the shocking story of the flawed genius considered by many \nto be the greatest wizard of his generation. Striping away the popular image of \nserene, silver-bearded wisdom, Rita Skeeter reveals the disturbed childhood, the \nlawless youth, the life-long feuds, and the guilty secrets that Dumbledore carried \nto his grave, WHY was the man tipped to be the Minister of Magic content to \nremain a mere headmaster? WHAT was the real purpose of the secret \norganization known as the Order of the Phoenix? HOW did Dumbledore really \nmeet his end? \n\n The answers to these and many more questions are explored in the \nexplosive new biography, The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore, by Rita Skeeter, \nexclusively interviewed by Berry Braithwaite, page 13, inside. \n\n \n\n Harry ripped open the paper and found page thirteen. The article was topped with \na picture showing another familiar face: a woman wearing jeweled glasses with \nelaborately curled blonde hair, her teeth bared in what was clearly supposed to be a \nwinning smile, wiggling her fingers up at him. Doing his best to ignore this nauseating \nimage, Harry read on. \n\n \n\nIn person, Rita Skeeter is much warmer and softer than her famously \nferocious quill-portraits might suggest. Greeting me in the hallway of her cozy \nhome, she leads me straight into the kitchen for a cup of tea, a slice of pound cake \nand, it goes without saying, a steaming vat of freshest gossip. \n\n\"Well, of course, Dumbledore is a biographer's dream,\" says Skeeter. \"Such a \nlong, full life. I'm sure my book will be the first of very, very many.\" \n\nSkeeter was certainly quick off the mark. Her nine-hundred-page book was \ncompleted in a mere four weeks after Dumbledore's mysterious death in June. I \nask her how she managed this superfast feat. \n\n\"Oh, when you've been a journalist as long as I have, working to a deadline is \nsecond nature. I knew that the Wizarding world was clamoring for the full story \nand I wanted to be the first to meet that need.\" \n\n\f\nI mention the recent, widely publicized remarks of Elphias Doge, Special \nAdvisor to the Wizengamot and longstanding friend of Albus Dumbledore's, that \n\"Skeeter's book contains less fact than a Chocolate Frog card.\" \n\nSkeeter throws back her head and laughs. \n\n\"Darling Dodgy! I remember interviewing him a few years back about \nmerpeople rights, bless him. Completely gaga, seemed to think we were sitting at \nthe bottom of Lake Windermere, kept telling me to watch out for trout.\" \n\nAnd yet Elphias Doge's accusations of inaccuracy have been echoed in many \nplaces. Does Skeeter really feel that four short weeks have been enough to gain a \nfull picture of Dumbledore's long and extraordinary life? \n\n\"Oh, my dear,\" beams Skeeter, rapping me affectionately across the knuckles, \n\"you know as well as I do how much information can be generated by a fat bag of \nGalleons, a refusal to hear the word 'no,' and a nice sharp Quick-Quotes Quill! \nPeople were queuing to dish the dirt on Dumbledore anyway. Not everyone \nthought he was so wonderful, you know \u2013 he trod on an awful lot of important \ntoes. But old Dodgy Doge can get off his high hippogriff, because I've had access \nto a source most journalists would swap their wands for, one who has never \nspoken in public before and who was close to Dumbledore during the most \nturbulent and disturbing phase of his youth.\" \n\nThe advance publicity for Skeeter's biography has certainly suggested that \nthere will be shocks in store for those who believe Dumbledore to have led a \nblameless life. What were the biggest surprises she uncovered, I ask? \n\n\"Now, come off it. Betty, I'm not giving away all the highlights before \nanybody's bought the book!\" laughs Skeeter. \"But I can promise that anybody \nwho still thinks Dumbledore was white as his beard is in for a rude awakening! \nLet's just say that nobody hearing him rage against You-Know-Who would have \ndreamed that he dabbled in the Dark Arts himself in his youth! And for a wizard \nwho spent his later years pleading for tolerance, he wasn't exactly broad-minded \nwhen he was younger! Yes, Albus Dumbledore had an extremely murky past, not \nto mention that very fishy family, which he worked so hard to keep hushed up.\" \n\nI ask whether Skeeter is referring to Dumbledore's brother, Aberforth, whose \nconviction by the Wizengamot for misuse of magic caused a minor scandal fifteen \nyears ago. \n\n\"Oh, Aberforth is just the tip of the dung heap,\u201d laughs Skeeter. \"No, no, I'm \ntalking about much worse than a brother with a fondness for fiddling about with \ngoats, worse even than the Muggle-maiming father \u2013 Dumbledore couldn't keep \neither of them quiet anyway, they were both charged by the Wizengamot. No, it's \nthe mother and the sister that intrigued me, and a little digging uncovered a \n\n\f\npositive nest of nastiness \u2013 but, as I say, you'll have to wait for chapters nine to \ntwelve for full details. All I can say now is, it's no wonder Dumbledore never \ntalked about how his nose got broken.\" \n\nFamily skeletons notwithstanding, does Skeeter deny the brilliance that led to \nDumbledore's many magical discoveries? \n\n\"He had brains,\" she concedes, \"although many now question whether he \ncould really take full credit for all of his supposed achievements. As I reveal in \nchapter sixteen, Ivor Dillonsby claims he had already discovered eight uses of \ndragon's blood when Dumbledore 'borrowed' his papers.\" \n\nBut the importance of some of Dumbledore's achievements cannot, I venture, \nbe denied. What of his famous defeat of Grindelwald? \n\n\"Oh, now, I'm glad you mentioned Grindelwald,\" says Skeeter with such a \ntantalizing smile. \"I'm afraid those who go dewy-eyed over Dumbledore's \nspectacular victory must brace themselves for a bombshell \u2013 or perhaps a \nDungbomb. Very dirty business indeed. All I'll say is, don't be so sure that there \nreally was a spectacular duel of legend. After they've read my book, people may \nbe forced to conclude that Grindelwald simply conjured a white handkerchief \nfrom the end of his wand and came quietly!\" \n\nSkeeter refuses to give any more away on this intriguing subject, so we turn \ninstead to the relationship that will undoubtedly fascinate her readers more than \nany other. \n\n\"Oh yes,\" says Skeeter, nodding briskly, \"I devote an entire chapter to the \nwhole Potter-Dumbledore relationship. It's been called unhealthy, even sinister. \nAgain, your readers will have to buy my book for the whole story, but there is no \nquestion that Dumbledore took an unnatural interest in Potter from the word go. \nWhether that was really in the boy's best interests \u2013 well, we'll see. It's certainly \nan open secret that Potter has had a most troubled adolescence.\" \n\nI ask whether Skeeter is still in touch with Harry Potter, whom she so \nfamously interviewed last year: a breakthrough piece in which Potter spoke \nexclusively of his conviction that You-Know-Who had returned. \n\n\"Oh, yes, we've developed a closer bond,\" says Skeeter. \"Poor Potter has few \nreal friends, and we met at one of the most testing moments of his life \u2013 the \nTriwizard Tournament. I am probably one of the only people alive who can say \nthat they know the real Harry Potter.\" \n\nWhich leads us neatly to the many rumors still circulating about Dumbledore's \nfinal hours. Does Skeeter believe that Potter was there when Dumbledore died? \n\n\f\n\"Well, I don't want to say too much \u2013 it's all in the book \u2013 but eyewitnesses \ninside Hogwarts castle saw Potter running away from the scene moments after \nDumbledore fell, jumped, or was pushed. Potter later gave evidence against \nSeverus Snape, a man against whom he has a notorious grudge. Is everything as it \nseems? That is for the Wizarding community to decide \u2013 once they've read my \nbook.\" \n\nOn that intriguing note, I take my leave. There can be no doubt that Skeeter \nhas quilled an instant bestseller. Dumbledore's legion of admirers, meanwhile, \nmay well be trembling at what is soon to emerge about their hero. \n\n \n\n Harry reached the bottom of the article, but continued to stare blankly at the page. \nRevulsion and fury rose in him like vomit; he balled up the newspaper and threw it, with \nall his force, at the wall, where it joined the rest of the rubbish heaped around his \noverflowing bin. \n\n He began to stride blindly around the room, opening empty drawers and picking \nup books only to replace them on the same piles, barely conscious of what he was doing, \nas random phrases from Rita's article echoed in his head: An entire chapter to the whole \nPotter-Dumbledore relationship ... It's been called unhealthy, even sinister ... He dabbled \nin the Dark Arts himself in his youth ... I've had access to a source most journalists would \nswap their wands for... \n\n \"Lies!\" Harry bellowed, and through the window he saw the next-door neighbor, \nwho had paused to restart his lawn mower, look up nervously. \n\n Harry sat down hard on the bed. The broken bit of mirror danced away from him; \nhe picked it up and turned it over in his fingers, thinking, thinking of Dumbledore and the \nlies with which Rita Skeeter was defaming him ... \n\n A flash of brightest blue. Harry froze, his cut finger slipping on the jagged edge of \nthe mirror again. He had imagined it, he must have done. He glanced over his shoulder, \nbut the wall was a sickly peach color of Aunt Petunia's choosing: There was nothing blue \nthere for the mirror to reflect. He peered into the mirror fragment again, and saw nothing \nbut his own bright green eye looking back at him. \n\n He had imagined it, there was no other explanation; imagined it, because he had \nbeen thinking of his dead headmaster. If anything was certain, it was that the bright blue \neyes of Albus Dumbledore would never pierce him again. \n\n\f\nChapter Three \n\nThe Dursleys Departing \n\nThe sound of the front door slamming echoed up the stairs and a voice roared, \n\u201cOh! You!\u201d \n\nSixteen years of being addressed thus left Harry in no doubt when his uncle was \ncalling, nevertheless, he did not immediately respond. He was still at the narrow fragment \nin which, for a split second, he had thought he saw Dumbledore\u2019s eye. It was not until his \nuncle bellowed, \u201cBOY!\u201d that Harry got slowly out of bed and headed for the bedroom \ndoor, pausing to add the piece of broken mirror to the rucksack filled with things he \nwould be taking with him. \n\n\u201cYou took you time!\u201d roared Vernon Dursley when Harry appeared at the top of \nthe stairs, \u201cGet down here. I want a word!\u201d \n\nHarry strolled downstairs, his hands deep in his pants pockets. When he searched \nthe living room he found all three Dursleys. They were dressed for packing; Uncle \nVernon in an old ripped-up jacket and Dudley, Harry\u2019s, large, blond, muscular cousin, in \nhis leather jacket. \n\n \u201cYes?\u201d asked Harry. \n\n \u201cSit down!\u201d said Uncle Vernon. Harry raised his eyebrows. \u201cPlease!\u201d added \nUncle Vernon, wincing slightly as though the word was sharp in his throat. \n\nHarry sat. He though he knew what was coming. His uncle began to pace up and down, \nAunt Petunia and Dudley, following his movement with anxious expressions. Finally, his \nlarge purple face crumpled with concentration. Uncle Vernon stopped in front of Harry \nand spoke. \n\n \"I've changed my mind,\u201d he said. \n\n\"What a surprise,\" said Harry. \n\n\"Don't you take that tone\u2014\" began Aunt Petunia in a shrill voice, but Vernon \nDursley waved her down \n\n\"It's all a lot of claptrap,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, glaring at Harry with piggy little \neyes. \"I've decided I don't believe a word of it. We\u2019re staying put, we\u2019re not going \nanywhere.\u201d \n\nHarry looked up at his uncle and felt a mixture of exasperation and amusement. \nVernon Dursley had been changing his mind every twenty four hours for the past four \nweeks, packing and unpacking and repacking the car with every change of heart. Harry\u2019s \nfavorite moment had been the one when Uncle Vernon, unaware the Dudley had added \nhis dumbbells to his case since the last time it been repacked, had attempted to hoist it \nback into the boot and collapsed with a yelp of pain and much swearing. \n\n\u201cAccording to you,\u201d Vernon Dursley said, now resuming his pacing up and down \nthe living room, \u201cwe \u2013 Petunia, Dudley, and I \u2013 are in danger. From \u2013 from \u2013\u201c \n\n\u201cSome of \u2018my lot\u2019 right?\u201d said Harry \n\n\u201cWell I don\u2019t believe it,\u201d repeated Uncle Vernon, coming to a halt in front of \nHarry again. \"I was awake half the night thinking it all over, and I believe it's a plot to get \nthe house.\" \n\n \"The house?\" repeated Harry. \"What house?\" \n\n \"This house!\" shrieked Uncle Vernon, the vein his forehead starting to pulse. \n\"Our house! House prices are skyrocketing around here! You want us out of the way and \n\n\f\nthen you're going to do a bit of hocus pocus and before we know it the deeds will be in \nyour name and \u2013\" \n\n \u201cAre you out of your mind?\" demanded Harry. \"A plot to get this house? Are you \nactually as stupid as you look?\" \n\n \"Don't you dare --!\" squealed Aunt Petunia, but again Vernon waved her \ndown. Slights on his personal appearance were it seemed as nothing to the danger he had \nspotted. \n\n \"Just in case you've forgotten,\" said Harry, \"I've already got a house my godfather \nleft me one. So why would I want this one? All the happy memories?\" \n\n There was silence. Harry thought he had rather impressed his uncle with this \nargument. \n\n \"You claim,\" said Uncle Vernon, starting to pace yet again, \"that this Lord Thing \n\u2013\" \n\n \"\u2014Voldemort,\" said Harry impatiently, \"and we've been through this about a \nhundred times already. This isn't a claim, it's fact. Dumbledore told you last year, and \nKingsley and Mr. Weasley \u2013\" \n\nVernon Dursley hunched his shoulders angrily, and Harry guessed that his uncle \nwas attempting to ward off recollections of the unannounced visit, a few days into Harry's \nsummer holidays, of two fully grown wizards. The arrival on the doorstep of Kingsley \nShacklebolt and Arthur Weasley had come as a most unpleasant shock to the Dursleys. \nHarry had to admit, however that as Mr. Weasley had once demolished half of the living \nroom, his reappearance could not have been expected to delight Uncle Vernon. \n\n \"\u2014Kingsley and Mr. Weasley explained it all as well,\" Harry pressed on \nremorselessly, \"Once I'm seventeen, the protective charm that keeps me safe will break, \nand that exposes you as well as me. The Order is sure Voldemort will target you, \nwhether to torture you to try and find out where I am, or because he thinks by holding \nyou hostage I'd come and try to rescue you.\" \n\n Uncle Vernon's and Harry's eyes met. Harry was sure that in that instant they were \nboth wondering the same thing. Then Uncle Vernon walked on and Harry resumed, \n\"You've got to go into hiding and the Order wants to help. You're being offered serious \nprotection, the best there is.\" \n\n Uncle Vernon said nothing but continued to pace up and down. Outside the sun \nhung low over the privet hedges. The next door neighbor's lawn mower stalled again. \n\n \"I thought there was a Ministry of Magic?\" asked Vernon Dursley abruptly. \n\n \"There is,\" said Harry, surprised. \n\n\"Well, then, why can't they protect us? It seems to me that, as innocent victims, guilty of \nnothing more than harboring a marked man, we ought to qualify for government \nprotection!\" \n\nHarry laughed; he could not help himself. It was so very typical of his uncle to put \nhis hopes in the establishment, even within this world that he despised and mistrusted. \n\n\"You heard what Mr. Weasley and Kingsley said,\" Harry replied. \n\n\"We think the Ministry has been infiltrated.\" \n\n Uncle Vernon strode back to the fireplace and back breathing so strongly that his \ngreat black mustache rippled his face still purple with concentration. \n\n\f\n \"All right,\" he said. Stopping in front of Harry get again. \"All right, let's say for \nthe sake of argument we accept this protection. I still don't see why we can't have that \nKingsley bloke.\" \n\n Harry managed not to roll his eyes, but with difficulty. This question had also \nbeen addressed half a dozen times. \n\n \"As I've told you,\" he said through gritted teeth, \"Kingsley is protecting the Mug \n\u2013 I mean, your Prime Minister.\" \n\n \"Exactly \u2013 he's the best!\" said Uncle Vernon, pointing at the blank television \nscreen. The Dursleys had spotted Kingsley on the news, walking along the Muggle Prime \nMinister as he visited a hospital. This, and the fact that Kingsley had mastered the knack \nof dressing like a Muggle, not to mention a certain reassuring something in his slow, deep \nvoice, had caused the Dursleys to take to Kingsley in a way that they had certainly not \ndone with any other wizard, although it was true that they had never seen him with \nearring in. \n\n \"Well, he's taken,\u201d said Harry. \"But Hestia Jones and Dedalus Diggle are more \nthan up to the job \u2013\" \n\n \"If we'd even seen CVs\u2026\" began Uncle Vernon, but Harry lost patience. Getting \nto his feet, he advanced on his uncle, not pointing at the TV set himself. \n\n \"These accidents aren't accidents \u2013 the crashed and explosions and derailments \nand whatever else has happened since we last watched the news. People are disappearing \nand dying and he's behind it \u2013 Voldemort. I've told you this over and over again, he kills \nMuggles for fun. Even the fogs \u2013 they're caused by dementors, and if you can't remember \nwhat they are, ask your son!\" \n\n Dudley's hands jerked upward to tower his mouth. With his parents' and Harry's \neyes upon him, he slowly lowered them again and asked, \"There are\u2026 more of them?\" \n\n\"More?\" laughed Harry. \"More than the two that attacked us, you mean? Of course there \nare hundreds, maybe thousands by this time, seeing as they feed off fear and despair\u2014\" \n\n\"All right, all right blustered,\" blustered Vernon Dursley. \"You've made your \npoint \u2013\" \n\n\"I hope so,\" said Harry, \"because once I'm seventeen, all of them \u2013 Death Eaters, \nelementors, maybe even Inferi \u2013 which means dead bodies enchanted by a Dark wizard \u2013 \nwill be able to find you and will certainly attack you. And if you remember the last time \nyou tried to outrun wizards, I think you'll agree you need help.\" \n\nThere was a brief silence in which the distant echo of Hagrid smashing down a \nwooden front door seemed to reverberate through the intervening years. Aunt Petunia \nwas looking at Uncle Vernon; Dudley was staring at Harry. Finally Uncle Vernon \nblurted out, \"But what about my work? What about Dudley's school? I don't suppose \nthose things matter to a bunch of layabout wizards \u2013\" \n\n\"Don't you understand?\" shouted Harry. \"They will torture and kill you like they \ndid my parents!\" \n\n\"Dad,\" said Dudley in a loud voice, \"Dad \u2013 I'm going with these Order people.\" \n\n\"Dudley,\" said Harry, \"for the first time in your life, you're talking sense.\" \n\nHe knew the battle was won. If Dudley was frightened enough to accept the Order's help, \nhis parents would accompany him. There could be no question of being separated from \ntheir Duddykins. Harry glanced at the carriage clock on the mantelpiece. \n\n\f\n\"They'll be here in about five minutes, he said, and when one of the Dursleys \nreplied, he left the room. The prospect of parting\u2014probably forever \u2013 from his aunt, \nuncle, and cousin was one that he was able to contemplate quite cheerfully but there was \nnevertheless a certain awkwardness in the air. What did you say to one another at the end \nof sixteen years' solid dislike? \n\nBack in his bedroom, Harry fiddled aimlessly with his rucksack then poked a \ncouple of owl nuts through the bats of Hedwig's cage. They fell with dull thuds to the \nbottom where she ignored them. \n\n\"We're leaving soon, really soon,\" Harry told her. \"And then you'll be able to fly \nagain.\" \n\nThe doorbell rang. Harry hesitated, then headed back out of his room and \ndownstairs. It was too much to expect Hestia and Dedalus to cope with the Dursleys on \ntheir own. \n\n\"Harry Potter!\" squeaked an excited voice, the moment Harry had opened the \ndoor; a small man in a mauve top hat that was sweeping him a deep bow. \"An honor as \never!\" \n\n\"Thanks, Dedalus,\" said Harry, bestowing a small and embarrassed smile upon \nthe dark haired Hestia. \"It's really good of you to do this\u2026 They're through here, my aunt \nand uncle and cousin\u2026\" \n\n\"Good day to you, Harry Potter's relatives!\" said Dedalus happily striding into the \nliving room. The Dursleys did not look at all happy to be addressed thus; Harry half \nexpected another change of mind. Dudley shrank neared to his mother at the sight of the \nwitch and wizard. \n\n\"I see you are packed and ready. Excellent! The plan, as Harry has told you, is a \nsimple one,\" said Dedalus, pulling an immense pocket watch out of his waistcoat and \nexamining it. \"We shall be leaving before Harry does. Due to the danger of using magic \nin your house \u2013Harry being still underage it could provide the Ministry with an excuse to \narrest him \u2013 we shall be driving, say, ten miles or so before Disapparating to the safe \nlocation we have picked out for you. You know how to drive, I take it?\" He asked Uncle \nVernon politely. \n\n\"Know how to \u2013? Of course I ruddy well know how to drive!\" spluttered Uncle \nVernon. \n\n\"Very clever of you, sir, very clever. I personally would be utterly bamboozled by \nall those buttons and knobs,\" said Dedalus. He was clearly under the impression that he \nwas flattering Vernon Dursley, who was visibly losing confidence in the plan with every \nword Dedalus spoke. \n\n\"Can't even drive,\" he muttered under his breath, his mustache rippling \nindignantly, but fortunately neither Dedalus nor Hestia seemed to hear him. \n\n\"You, Harry,\" Dedalus continued, \"will wait here for your guard. There has been \na little change in the arrangements \u2013\" \n\n\u201cWhat d'you mean?\" said Harry at once. \"I thought Mad-Eye was going to come \nand take me by Side Along-Apparition?\" \n\n\"Can't do it,\" said Hestia tersely, \"Mad-Eye will explain.\" \n\nThe Dursleys, who had listened to all of this with looks of utter incomprehension \non their faces, jumped as a loud voice screeched, \"Hurry up!\" Harry looked all around the \nroom before realizing the voice had issued from Dedalus's pocket watch. \n\n\f\n\"Quite right, were operating to a very tight schedule,\" said Dedalus nodding at his \nwatch and tucking it back into his waist coat. \"We are attempting to time your departure \nfrom the house with your family's Disapparition, Harry thus the charm breaks the \nmoment you all head for safety.\" He turned to the Dursleys, \"Well, are we all packed and \nready to go?\" \n\nNone of them answered him. Uncle Vernon was still staring appalled at the bulge \nin Dedalus's waistcoat pocket. \n\n\"Perhaps we should wait outside in the hall, Dedalus,\" murmured Hestia. She \nclearly felt that it would be tactless for them to remain the room while Harry and the \nDursleys exchanged loving, possibly tearful farewells. \n\n\"There's no need,\" Harry muttered, but Uncle Vernon made any further \nexplanation unnecessary by saying loudly, \n\n\"Well, this is good-bye then boy.\" \n\nHe swung his right arm upward to shake Harry's hand, but at the last moment \nseemed unable to face it, and merely closed his fist and began swinging it backward and \nforward like a metronome. \n\n \"Ready, Duddy?\" asked Petunia, fussily checking the clasp of her handbag so as \nto avoid looking at Harry altogether. \n\n Dudley did not answer but stood there with his mouth slightly ajar, reminding \nHarry a little of the giant, Grawp. \n\n \"Come along, then,\" said Uncle Vernon. \n\nHe had already reached the living room door when Dudley mumbled, \"I don't \nunderstand.\" \n\n\"What don't you understand, popkin?\" asked Petunia looking up at her son. \n\nDudley raised a large, hamlike hand to point at Harry. \n\n\"Why isn't he coming with us? \n\nUncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia froze when they stood staring at Dudley as \nthough he had just expressed a desire to become a ballerina. \n\n\"What?\" said Uncle Vernon loudly. \n\n\"Why isn't he coming too?\" asked Dudley. \n\n\"Well, he\u2014doesn't want to,\" said Uncle Vernon, turning to glare at Harry and \nadding, \"You don't want to, do you?\" \n\n\"Not in the slightest,\" said Harry. \n\n\"There you are,\" Uncle Vernon told Dudley. \"Now come on we're off.\" \n\nHe marched out of the room. They heard the front door open, but Dudley did not \nmove and after a few faltering steps Aunt Petunia stopped too. \n\n\"What now?\" barked Uncle Vernon, reappearing in the doorway. \n\nIt seemed that Dudley was struggling with concepts too difficult to put into words. \nAfter several moments of apparently painful internal struggle he said, \"But where's he \ngoing to go?\" \n\nAunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon looked at each other. It was clear that Dudley \nwas frightening them. Hestia Jones broke the silence. \n\n\"But\u2026 surely you know where your nephew is going?\" she asked looking \nbewildered. \n\n\"Certainly we know,\" said Vernon Dursley. \"He's off with some of your lot, isn't \nhe? Right, Dudley, let's get in the car, you heard the man, we're in a hurry. \n\n\f\nAgain, Vernon Dursley marched as far as the front door, but Dudley did not \nfollow. \n\n \"Off with some of our lot?\" \n\n Hestia looked outraged. Harry had met this attitude before Witches and wizards \nseemed stunned that his closed living relatives took so little interest in the famous Harry \nPotter. \n\n\"It's fine,\" Harry assured her. \"It doesn't matter, honestly.\" \n\n\"Doesn't matter?\" repeated Hestia, her voice rising considerably. \n\n\"Don't these people realize what you've been through? What danger you are in? \nThe unique position you hold in the hearts of the anti Voldemort movement?\" \n\n \"Er \u2013no, they don't,\" said Harry. \"They think I'm a waste of space, actually but I'm \nused to \u2013\" \n\n \"I don't think you're a waste of space\" \n\n If Harry had not seen Dudley's lips move, he might not have believed it. As it was, \nhe stared at Dudley for several seconds before accepting that it must have been his cousin \nwho had spoken; for one thing, Dudley had turned red. Harry was embarrassed and \nastonished himself. \n\n \"Well... er\u2026 thanks, Dudley.\" \n\n Again, Dudley appeared to grapple with thoughts too unwieldy for expression \nbefore mumbling, \"You saved my life,\" \n\n \"Not really,\" said Harry. \"It was your soul the dementor would have taken\u2026\" \n\n He looked curiously at his cousin. They had had virtually no contact during this \nsummer or last, as Harry had come back to Privet Drive so briefly and kept to his room so \nmuch. It now dawned on Harry, however, that the cup of cold tea on which he had \ntrodden that morning might not have been a booby trap at all. Although rather touched he \nwas nevertheless quite relieved that Dudley appeared to have exhausted his ability to \nexpress his feelings. After opening his mouth once or twice more, Dudley subsided into \nscarlet-faced silence. \n\nAunt Petunia burst into tears. Hestia Jones gave her an approving look that \nchanged to outrage as Aunt Petunia ran forward and embraced Dudley rather than Harry. \n\n\"S-so sweet, Dudders\u2026\" she sobbed into his massive chest. \"S-such a lovely b-boy\u2026 s-\nsaying thank you\u2026\" \n\n \"But he hasn't said thank you at all!\" said Hestia indignantly. \"He only said he \ndidn't think Harry was a waste of space!\" \n\n\"Yea but coming from Dudley that's like 'I love you,'\" said Harry, torn between \nannoyance and a desire to laugh as Aunt Petunia continued to clutch at Dudley as if he \nhad just saved Harry from a burning building. \n\n\"Are we going or not?\" roared Uncle Vernon, reappearing yet again at the living \nroom door. \"I thought we were on a tight schedule!\" \n\n\"Yes \u2013yes, we are,\" said Dedalus Diggle, who had been watching these exchanged \nwith an air of bemusement and now seemed to pull himself together. \"We really must be \noff. Harry \u2013\" \n\nHe tripped forward and wrung Harry's hand with both of his own. \n\n\"\u2014good luck. I hope we meet again. The hopes of the Wizarding world rest upon \nyour shoulders.\" \n\n\"Oh,\" said Harry, \"right. Thanks.\" \n\n\f\n\"Farwell, Harry,\" said Hestia also clasping his hand. \"Our thoughts go with you.\" \n\n\"I hope everything's okay,\" said Harry with a glance toward Aunt Petunia and \nDudley. \n\n\"Oh I'm sure we shall end up the best of chums,\" said Diggle slightly, waving his \nhat as he left the room. Hestia followed him. \n\nDudley gently released himself from his mother's clutches and walked toward \nHarry who had to repress an urge to threaten him with magic. Then Dudley held out his \nlarge, pink hand. \n\n\"Blimey, Dudley,\" said Harry over Aunt Petunia's renewed sobs, \"did the \ndementors blow a different personality into you?\" \n\n\"Dunno,\" muttered Dudley, \"See you, Harry.\" \n\n\"Yea \u2026\" said Harry, raking Dudley's hand and shaking it. \"Maybe. Take care, \nBig D.\" \n\nDudley nearly smiled. They lumbered from the room. Harry heard his heavy \nfootfalls on the graveled drive, and then a car door slammed. \n\nAunt Petunia whose face had been buried in her handkerchief looked around at \nthe sound. She did not seem to have expected to find herself alone with Harry. Hastily \nstowing her wet handkerchief into her pocket, she said, \"Well \u2013 good-bye\" and marched \ntowards the door without looking at him. \n\n\"Good-bye\" said Harry. \n\nShe stopped and looked back. For a moment Harry had the strangest feeling that \nshe wanted to say something to him; She gave him an odd, tremulous look and seemed to \nteeter on the edge of speech, but then, with a little of her head, she hustled out of the \nroom after he husband and son. \n\n \n\nChapter Four \n\nThe Seven Potters \n\n \n\nHarry ran back upstairs to his bedroom, arriving at the window just in time to see \nthe Dursleys' car swinging out of the drive and off up the road. Dedalus\u2019s top hat was \nvisible between Aunt Petunia and Dudley in the backseat. The car turned right at the end \nof Privet Drive, its windows burned scarlet for a moment in the now setting sun, and then \nit was gone. \n\n Harry picked up Hedwig\u2019s cage, his Firebolt, and his rucksack, gave his \nunnaturally tidy bedroom one last sweeping look, and then made his ungainly way back \ndownstairs to the hall, where he deposited cage, broomstick, and bag near the foot of the \nstairs. The light was fading rapidly, the hall full of shadows in the evening light. It felt \nmost strange to stand here in the silence and know that he was about to leave the house \nfor the last time. Long ago, when he had been left alone while the Dursleys went out to \nenjoy themselves, the hours of solitude had been a rare treat. Pausing only to sneak \nsomething tasty from the fridge, he had rushed upstairs to play on Dudley\u2019s computer, or \nput on the television and flicked through the channels to his heart\u2019s content. It gave him \nan odd, empty feeling remembering those times; it was like remembering a younger \nbrother whom he had lost. \n\n\f\n \u201cDon\u2019t you want to take a last look at the place?\u201d he asked Hedwig, who was still \nsulking with her head under her wing. \u201cWe\u2019ll never be here again. Don\u2019t you want to \nremember all the good times? I mean, look at this doormat. What memories \u2026 Dudley \nsobbed on it after I saved him from the dementors \u2026 Turns out he was grateful after all, \ncan you believe it? \u2026 And last summer, Dumbledore walked through that front door \u2026 \u201c \n\n Harry lost the thread of his thoughts for a moment and Hedwig did nothing to \nhelp him retrieve it, but continued to sit with her head under her wing. Harry turned his \nback on the front door. \n\n \u201cAnd under here, Hedwig\u201d \u2013 Harry pulled open a door under the stairs \u2013 \u201cis where \nI used to sleep! You never knew me then \u2013 Blimey, it\u2019s small, I\u2019d forgotten \u2026 \u201c \n\n Harry looked around at the stacked shoes and umbrellas remembering how he \nused to wake every morning looking up at the underside of the staircase, which was more \noften than not adorned with a spider or two. Those had been the days before he had \nknown anything about his true identity; before he had found out how his parents had died \nor why such strange things often happened around him. But Harry could still remember \nthe dreams that had dogged him, even in those days: confused dreams involving flashes \nof green light and once \u2013 Uncle Vernon had nearly crashed the car when Harry had \nrecounted it \u2013 a flying motorbike \u2026 \n\n There was a sudden, deafening roar from somewhere nearby. Harry straightened \nup with a jerk and smacked the top of his head on the low door frame. Pausing only to \nemploy a few of Uncle Vernon\u2019s choicest swear words, he staggered back into the \nkitchen, clutching his head and staring out of the window into the back garden. \n\n The darkness seemed to be rippling, the air itself quivering. Then, one by one, \nfigures began to pop into sight as their Disillusionment Charms lifted. Dominating the \nscene was Hagrid, wearing a helmet and goggles and sitting astride an enormous \nmotorbike with a black sidecar attached. All around him other people were dismounting \nfrom brooms and, in two cases, skeletal, black winged horses. \n\n Wrenching open the back door, Harry hurtled into their midst. There was a \ngeneral cry of greeting as Hermione flung her arms around him, Ron clapped him on the \nback, and Hagrid said, \u201cAll righ\u2019, Harry? Ready fer the off?\u201d \n\n \u201cDefinitely,\u201d said Harry, beaming around at them all. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t expecting this \nmany of you!\u201d \n\n \u201cChange of plan,\u201d growled Mad-Eye, who was holding two enormous bulging \nsacks, and whose magical eye was spinning from darkening sky to house to garden with \ndizzying rapidity. \u201cLet\u2019s get undercover before we talk you through it.\u201d \n\n Harry led them all back into the kitchen where, laughing and chattering, they \nsettled on chairs, sat themselves upon Aunt Petunia\u2019s gleaming work surfaces, or leaned \nup against her spotless appliances; Ron, long and lanky; Hermione, her bushy hair tied \nback in a long plait; Fred and George, grinning identically; Bill, badly scarred and long-\nhaired; Mr. Weasley, kind-faced, balding, his spectacles a little awry; Mad-Eye, battle-\nworn, one-legged, his bright blue magical eye whizzing in its socket; Tonks, whose short \nhair was her favorite shade of bright pink; Lupin, grayer, more lined; Fleur, slender and \nbeautiful, with her long silvery blonde hair; Kingsley, bald and broad-shouldered; Hagrid, \nwith his wild hair and beard, standing hunchbacked to avoid hitting his head on the \nceiling; and Mundungus Fletcher, small, dirty, and hangdog, with his droopy beady \nhound\u2019s eyes and matted hair. Harry\u2019s heart seemed to expand and glow at the sight: He \n\n\f\nfelt incredibly fond of all of them, even Mundungus, whom he had tried to strangle the \nlast time they had met. \n\n \u201cKingsley, I thought you were looking after the Muggle Prime Minister?\u201d he \ncalled across the room. \n\n \u201cHe can get along without me for one night,\u201d said Kingsley, \u201cYou\u2019re more \nimportant.\u201d \n\n \u201cHarry, guess what?\u201d said Tonks from her perch on top of the washing machine, \nand she wiggled her left hand at him; a ring glistened there. \n\n \u201cYou got married?\u201d Harry yelped, looking from her to Lupin. \n\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry you couldn\u2019t be there, Harry, it was very quiet.\u201d \n\n \u201cThat\u2019s brilliant, congrat \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cAll right, all right, we\u2019ll have time for a cozy catch-up later,\u201d roared Moody over \nthe hubbub, and silence fell in the kitchen. Moody dropped his sacks at his feet and \nturned to Harry. \u201cAs Dedalus probably told you, we had to abandon Plan A. Pius \nThicknesse has gone over, which gives us a big problem. He\u2019s made it an imprisonable \noffense to connect this house to the Floo Network, place a Portkey here, or Apparate in or \nout. All done in the name of your protection, to prevent You-Know-Who getting in at you. \nAbsolutely pointless, seeing as your mother\u2019s charm does that already. What he\u2019s really \ndone is to stop you getting out of here safely.\u201d \n\n \u201cSecond problem: You\u2019re underage, which means you\u2019ve still got the Trace on \nyou.\u201d \n\n \u201cI don\u2019t \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cThe Trace, the Trace!\u201d said Mad-Eye impatiently. \u201cThe charm that detects \nmagical activity around under-seventeens, the way the Ministry finds out about underage \nmagic! If you, or anyone around you, casts a spell to get you out of here, Thicknesse is \ngoing to know about it, and so will the Death Eaters.\u201d \n\n \u201cWe can\u2019t wait for the Trace to break, because the moment you turn seventeen \nyou\u2019ll lose all the protection your mother gave you. In short, Pius Thicknesse thinks he\u2019s \ngot you cornered good and proper.\u201d \n\n Harry could not help but agree with the unknown Thicknesse. \n\n \u201cSo what are we going to do?\u201d \n\n \u201cWe\u2019re going to use the only means of transport left to us, the only ones the Trace \ncan\u2019t detect, because we don\u2019t need to cast spells to use them: brooms, thestrals, and \nHagrid\u2019s motorbike.\u201d \n\n Harry could see flaws in this plan; however, he held his tongue to give Mad-Eye \nthe chance to address them. \n\n \u201cNow, your mother\u2019s charm will only break under two conditions: when you \ncome of age, or\u201d \u2013 Moody gestured around the pristine kitchen \u2013 \u201cyou no longer call this \nplace home. You and your aunt and uncle are going your separate ways tonight, in the \nfull understanding that you\u2019re never going to live together again, correct?\u201d \n\n Harry nodded. \n\n \u201cSo this time, when you leave, there\u2019ll be no going back, and the charm will break \nthe moment you get outside its range. We\u2019re choosing to break it early, because the \nalternative is waiting for You-Know-Who to come and seize you the moment you turn \nseventeen. \n\n\f\n \u201cThe one thing we\u2019ve got on our side is that You-Know-Who doesn\u2019t know we\u2019re \nmoving you tonight. We\u2019ve leaked a fake trail to the Ministry: They think you\u2019re not \nleaving until the thirtieth. However, this is You-Know-Who we\u2019re dealing with, so we \ncan\u2019t rely on him getting the date wrong; he\u2019s bound to have a couple of Death Eaters \npatrolling the skies in this general area, just in case. So, we\u2019ve given a dozen different \nhouses every protection we can throw at them. They all look like they could be the place \nwe\u2019re going to hide you, they\u2019ve all got some connection with the Order: my house, \nKingsley\u2019s place, Molly\u2019s Auntie Muriel\u2019s \u2013 you get the idea.\u201d \n\n \u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry, not entirely truthfully, because he could still spot a gaping \nhole in the plan. \n\n \u201cYou\u2019ll be going to Tonks\u2019s parents. Once you\u2019re within the boundaries of the \nprotective enchantments we\u2019ve put on their house you\u2019ll be able to use a Portkey to the \nBurrow. Any questions?\u201d \n\n \u201cEr \u2013 yes,\u201d said Harry. \u201cMaybe they won\u2019t know which of the twelve secure \nhouses I\u2019m heading for at first, but won\u2019t it be sort of obvious once\u201d \u2013 he performed a \nquick headcount \u2013 \u201cfourteen of us fly off toward Tonks\u2019s parents?\u201d \n\n \u201cAh,\u201d said Moody, \u201cI forgot to mention the key point. Fourteen of us won\u2019t be \nflying to Tonks\u2019s parents. There will be seven Harry Potters moving through the skies \ntonight, each of them with a companion, each pair heading for a different safe house.\u201d \n\n From inside his cloak Moody now withdrew a flask of what looked like mud. \nThere was no need for him to say another word; Harry understood the rest of the plan \nimmediately. \n\n \u201cNo!\u201d he said loudly, his voice ringing through the kitchen. \u201cNo way!\u201d \n\n \u201cI told them you\u2019d take it like this,\u201d said Hermione with a hint of complacency. \n\n \u201cIf you think I\u2019m going to let six people risk their lives -- !\u201d \n\n \u201c\u2014because it\u2019s the first time for all of us,\u201d said Ron. \n\n \u201cThis is different, pretending to be me \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cWell, none of us really fancy it, Harry,\u201d said Fred earnestly. \u201cImagine if \nsomething went wrong and we were stuck as specky, scrawny gits forever.\u201d \n\n Harry did not smile. \n\n \u201cYou can\u2019t do it if I don\u2019t cooperate, you need me to give you some hair.\u201d \n\n \u201cWell, that\u2019s the plan scuppered,\u201d said George. \u201cObviously there\u2019s no chance at \nall of us getting a bit of your hair unless you cooperate.\u201d \n\n \u201cYeah, thirteen of us against one bloke who\u2019s not allowed to use magic; we\u2019ve \ngot no chance,\u201d said Fred. \n\n \u201cFunny,\u201d said Harry, \u201creally amusing.\u201d \n\n \u201cIf it has to come to force, then it will,\u201d growled Moody, his magical eye now \nquivering a little in its socket as he glared at Harry. \u201cEveryone here\u2019s overage, Potter, and \nthey\u2019re all prepared to take the risk.\u201d \n\n Mundungus shrugged and grimaced; the magical eye swerved sideways to glance \nat him out of the side of Moody\u2019s head. \n\n \u201cLet\u2019s have no more arguments. Time\u2019s wearing on. I want a few of your hairs, \nboy, now.\u201d \n\n \u201cBut this is mad, there\u2019s no need \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cNo need!\u201d snarled Moody. \u201cWith You-Know-Who out there and half the \nMinistry on his side? Potter, if we\u2019re lucky he\u2019ll have swallowed the fake bait and he\u2019ll \n\n\f\nbe planning to ambush you on the thirtieth, but he\u2019d be mad not to have a Death Eater or \ntwo keeping an eye out, it\u2019s what I\u2019d do. They might not be able to get at you or this \nhouse while your mother\u2019s charm holds, but it\u2019s about to break and they know the rough \nposition of the place. Our only chance is to use decoys. Even You-Know-Who can\u2019t split \nhimself into seven.\u201d \n\n Harry caught Hermione\u2019s eye and looked away at once. \n\n \u201cSo, Potter \u2013 some of your hair, if you please.\u201d \n\n Harry glanced at Ron, who grimaced at him in a just-do-it sort of way. \n\n \u201cNow!\u201d barked Moody. \n\n With all of their eyes upon him, Harry reached up to the top of his head, grabbed \na hank of hair, and pulled. \n\n \u201cGood,\u201d said Moody, limping forward as he pulled the stopper out of the flask of \npotion. \u201cStraight in here, if you please.\u201d \n\n Harry dropped the hair into the mudlike liquid. The moment it made contact with \nits surface, the potion began to froth and smoke, then, all at once, it turned a clear, bright \ngold. \n\n \u201cOoh, you look much tastier than Crabbe and Goyle, Harry,\u201d said Hermione, \nbefore catching sight of Ron\u2019s raised eyebrows, blushing slightly, and saying, \u201cOh, you \nknow what I mean \u2013 Goyle\u2019s potion tasted like bogies.\u201d \n\n \u201cRight then, fake Potters line up over here, please,\u201d said Moody. \n\n Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Fleur lined up in front of Aunt Petunia\u2019s \ngleaming sink. \n\n \u201cWe\u2019re one short,\u201d said Lupin. \n\n \u201cHere,\u201d said Hagrid gruffly, and he lifted Mundungus by the scruff of the neck \nand dropped him down beside Fleur, who wrinkled her nose pointedly and moved along \nto stand between Fred and George instead. \n\n \u201cI\u2019m a soldier, I\u2019d sooner be a protector,\u201d said Mundungus. \n\n \u201cShut it,\u201d growled Moody. \u201cAs I\u2019ve already told you, you spineless worm, any \nDeath Eaters we run into will be aiming to capture Potter, not kill him. Dumbledore \nalways said You-Know-Who would want to finish Potter in person. It\u2019ll be the protectors \nwho have got the most to worry about, the Death Eaters\u2019ll want to kill them.\u201d \n\n Mundungus did not look particularly reassured, but Moody was already pulling \nhalf a dozen eggcup-sized glasses from inside his cloak, which he handed out, before \npouring a little Polyjuice Potion into each one. \n\n \u201cAltogether, then \u2026 \u201c \n\n Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, Fleur, and Mundungus drank. All of them gasped \nand grimaced as the potion hit their throats; At once, their features began to bubble and \ndistort like hot wax. Hermione and Mundungus were shooting upward; Ron, Fred, and \nGeorge were shrinking; their hair was darkening, Hermione\u2019s and Fleur\u2019s appearing to \nshoot backward into their skulls. \n\n Moody, quite unconcerned, was now loosening the ties of the large sacks he had \nbrought with him. When he straightened up again, there were six Harry Potters gasping \nand panting in front of him. \n\n Fred and George turned to each other and said together, \u201cWow \u2013 we\u2019re identical!\u201d \n\n \u201cI dunno, though, I think I\u2019m still better-looking,\u201d said Fred, examining his \nreflection in the kettle. \n\n\f\n \u201cBah,\u201d said Fleur, checking herself in the microwave door, \u201cBill, don\u2019t look at me \n\u2013 I\u2019m \u2018ideous.\u201d \n\n \u201cThose whose clothes are a bit roomy, I\u2019ve got smaller here,\u201d said Moody, \nindicating the first sack, \u201cand vice versa. Don\u2019t forget the glasses, there\u2019s six pairs in the \nside pocket. And when you\u2019re dressed, there\u2019s luggage in the other sack.\u201d \n\n The real Harry thought that this might just be the most bizarre thing he had ever \nseen, and he had seen some extremely odd things. He watched as his six doppelgangers \nrummaged in the sacks, pulling out sets of clothes, putting on glasses, stuffing their own \nthings away. He felt like asking them to show a little more respect for privacy as they all \nbegan stripping off with impunity, clearly more at ease with displaying his body than \nthey would have been with their own. \n\n \u201cI knew Ginny was lying about that tattoo,\u201d said Ron, looking down at his bare \nchest. \n\n \u201cHarry, your eyesight really is awful,\u201d said Hermione, as she put on glasses. \n\n Once dressed, the fake Harrys took rucksacks and owl cages, each containing a \nstuffed snowy owl, from the second sack. \n\n \u201cGood,\u201d said Moody, as at last seven dressed, bespectacled, and luggage-laden \nHarrys faced him. \u201cThe pairs will be as follows: Mundungus will be traveling with me, \nby broom \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cWhy\u2019m I with you?\u201d grunted the Harry nearest the back door. \n\n \u201cBecause you\u2019re the one that needs watching,\u201d growled Moody, and sure enough, \nhis magical eye did not waver from Mundungus as he continued, \u201cArthur and Fred \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cI\u2019m George,\u201d said the twin at whom Moody was pointing. \u201cCan\u2019t you even tell \nus apart when we\u2019re Harry?\u201d \n\n \u201cSorry, George \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cI\u2019m only yanking your wand, I\u2019m Fred really \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cEnough messing around!\u201d snarled Moody. \u201cThe other one \u2013 George or Fred or \nwhoever you are \u2013 you\u2019re with Remus. Miss Delacour \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cI\u2019m taking Fleur on a thestral,\u201d said Bill. \u201cShe\u2019s not that fond of brooms.\u201d \n\n Fleur walked over to stand beside him, giving him a soppy, slavish look that \nHarry hoped with all his heart would never appear on his face again. \n\n \u201cMiss Granger with Kingsley, again by thestral \u2013\u201c \n\n Hermione looked reassured as she answered Kingsley\u2019s smile; Harry knew that \nHermione too lacked confidence on a broomstick. \n\n \u201cWhich leaves you and me, Ron!\u201d said Tonks brightly, knocking over a mug tree \nas she waved at him. \n\n Ron did not look quite as pleased as Hermione. \n\n \u201cAn\u2019 you\u2019re with me, Harry. That all righ\u2019?\u201d said Hagrid, looking a little anxious. \n\u201cWe\u2019ll be on the bike, brooms an\u2019 thestrals can\u2019t take me weight, see. Not a lot o\u2019 room \non the seat with me on it, though, so you\u2019ll be in the sidecar.\u201d \n\n \u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d said Harry, not altogether truthfully. \n\n \u201cWe think the Death Eaters will expect you to be on a broom,\u201d said Moody, who \nseemed to guess how Harry was feeling. \u201cSnape\u2019s had plenty of time to tell them \neverything about you he\u2019s never mentioned before, so if we do run into any Death Eaters, \nwe\u2019re betting they\u2019ll choose one of the Potters who looks at home on a broomstick. All \nright then,\u201d he went on, tying up the sack with the fake Potters\u2019 clothes in it and leading \n\n\f\nthe way back to the door, \u201cI make it three minutes until we\u2019re supposed to leave. No \npoint locking the back door, it won\u2019t keep the Death Eaters out when they come looking. \nCome on \u2026\u201d \n\n Harry hurried to gather his rucksack, Firebolt, and Hedwig\u2019s cage and followed \nthe group to the dark back garden. \n\n On every side broomsticks were leaping into hands; Hermione had already been \nhelped up onto a great black thestral by Kingsley, Fleur onto the other by Bill. Hagrid \nwas standing ready beside the motorbike, goggles on. \n\n \u201cIs this it? Is this Sirius\u2019s bike?\u201d \n\n \u201cThe very same,\u201d said Hagrid, beaming down at Harry. \u201cAn\u2019 the last time yeh \nwas on it, Harry, I could fit yeh in one hand!\u201d \n\n Harry could not help but feel a little humiliated as he got into the sidecar. It \nplaced him several feet below everybody else: Ron smirked at the sight of him sitting \nthere like a child in a bumper car. Harry stuffed his rucksack and broomstick down by his \nfeet and rammed Hedwig\u2019s cage between his knees. He was extremely uncomfortable. \n\n \u201cArthur\u2019s done a bit o\u2019 tinkerin\u2019,\u201d said Hagrid, quite oblivious to Harry\u2019s \ndiscomfort. He settled himself astride the motorcycle, which creaked slightly and sank \ninches into the ground. \u201cIt\u2019s got a few tricks up its sleeves now. Tha\u2019 one was my idea.\u201d \nHe pointed a thick finger at a purple button near the speedometer. \n\n\"Please be careful, Hagrid.\" said Mr. Weasley, who was standing beside them, \nholding his broomstick. \"I'm still not sure that was advisable and it's certainly only to be \nused in emergencies.\" \n\n\"All right, then.\" said Moody. \"Everyone ready, please. I want us all to leave at \nexactly the same time or the whole point of the diversion's lost.\" \n\nEverybody motioned their heads. \n\n\"Hold tight now, Ron,\" said Tonks, and Harry saw Ron throw a forcing, guilty look at \nLupin before placing his hands on each side of her waist. Hagrid kicked the motorbike \ninto life: It roared like a dragon, and the sidecar began to vibrate. \n\n \u201cGood luck, everyone,\u201d shouted Moody. \u201cSee you all in about an hour at the \nBurrow. On the count of three. One \u2026 two .. THREE.\u201d \n\n There was a great roar from the motorbike, and Harry felt the sidecar give a nasty \nlurch. He was rising through the air fast, his eyes watering slightly, hair whipped back off \nhis face. Around him brooms were soaring upward too; the long black tail of a thestral \nflicked past. His legs, jammed into the sidecar by Hedwig\u2019s cage and his rucksack, were \nalready sore and starting to go numb. So great was his discomfort that he almost forgot to \ntake a last glimpse of number four Privet Drive. By the time he looked over the edge of \nthe sidecar he could no longer tell which one it was. \n\nAnd then, out of nowhere, out of nothing, they were surrounded. At least thirty \nhooded figures, suspended in midair, formed a vast circle in the middle of which the \nOrder members had risen, oblivious \u2013 \n\nScreams, a blaze of green light on every side: Hagrid gave a yell and the \nmotorbike rolled over. Harry lost any sense of where they were. Streetlights above him, \nyells around him, he was clinging to the sidecar for dear life. Hedwig's cage, the Firebolt, \nand his rucksack slipped from beneath his knees \u2013 \n\n\"No \u2013 HELP!\" \n\n\f\nThe broomstick spun too, but he just managed to seize the strap of his rucksack \nand the top of the cage as the motorbike swung the right way up again. A second's relief, \nand then another burst of green light. The owl screeched and fell to the floor of the cage. \n\n\"No \u2013 NO!\" \n\nThe motorbike zoomed forward; Harry glimpsed hooded Death Eaters scattering \nas Hagrid blasted through their circle. \n\n\"Hedwig \u2013 Hedwig \u2013\" \n\nBut the owl lay motionless and pathetic as a toy on the floor of her cage. He could \nnot take it in, and his terror for the others was paramount. He glanced over his shoulder \nand saw a mass of people moving, flares of green light, two pairs of people on brooms \nsoaring off into the distance, but he could not tell who they were \u2013 \n\n\"Hagrid, we've got to go back, we've got to go back!\" he yelled over the \nthunderous roar of the engine, pulling out his wand, ramming Hedwig's cage into the \nfloor, refusing to believe that she was dead. \"Hagrid, TURN AROUND!\" \n\n\"My job's ter get you there safe, Harry!\" bellow Hagrid, and he opened the throttle. \n\n\"Stop \u2013 STOP!\" Harry shouted, but as he looked back again two jets of green light flew \npast his left ear: Four Death Eaters had broken away from the circle and were pursuing \nthem, aiming for Hagrid's broad back. Hagrid swerved, but the Death Eaters were \nkeeping up with the bike; more curses shot after them, and Harry had to sink low into the \nsidecar to avoid them. Wriggling around he cried, \"Stupefy!\" and a red bolt of light shot \nfrom his own wand, cleaving a gap between the four pursuing Death Eaters as they \nscattered to avoid it. \n\n\"Hold on, Harry, this'll do for 'em!\" roared Hagrid, and Harry looked up just in \ntime to see Hagrid slamming a thick finger into a green button near the fuel gauge. \n\nA wall, a solid black wall, erupted out of the exhaust pipe. Craning his neck, Harry saw it \nexpand into being in midair. Three of the Death Eaters swerved and avoided it, but the \nfourth was not so lucky; He vanished from view and then dropped like a boulder from \nbehind it, his broomstick broken into pieces. One of his fellows slowed up to save him, \nbut they and the airborne wall were swallowed by darkness as Hagrid leaned low over the \nhandlebars and sped up. \n\nMore Killing Curses flew past Harry's head from the two remaining Death Eaters' \nwands; they were aiming for Hagrid. Harry responded with further Stunning Spells: Red \nand green collided in midair in a shower of multicolored sparks, and Harry thought \nwildly of fireworks, and the Muggles below who would have no idea what was \nhappening \u2013 \n\n\"Here we go again, Harry, hold on!\" yelled Hagrid, and he jabbed at a second \nbutton. This time a great net burst from the bike's exhaust, but the Death Eaters were \nready for it. Not only did they swerve to avoid it, but the companion who had slowed to \nsave their unconscious friend had caught up. He bloomed suddenly out of the darkness \nand now three of them were pursuing the motorbike, all shooting curses after it. \n\n\"This'll do it, Harry, hold on tight!\" yelled Hagrid, and Harry saw him slam his \nwhole hand onto the purple button beside the speedometer. \n\nWith an unmistakable bellowing roar, dragon fire burst from the exhaust, white-\nhot and blue, and the motorbike shot forward like a bullet with a sound of wrenching \nmetal. Harry saw the Death Eaters swerve out of sight to avoid the deadly trail of flame, \n\n\f\nand at the same time felt the sidecar sway ominously: Its metal connections to the bike \nhad splintered with the force of acceleration. \n\n\"It's all righ', Harry!\" bellowed Hagrid, now thrown flat onto the back by the \nsurge of speed; nobody was steering now, and the sidecar was starting to twist violently \nin the bike's slipstream. \n\n\"I'm on it, Harry, don' worry!\" Hagrid yelled, and from inside his jacket pocket he \npulled his flowery pink umbrella. \n\n\"Hagrid! No! Let me!\" \n\n\"REPARO!\" \n\nThere was a deafening bang and the sidecar broke away from the bike completely. \nHarry sped forward, propelled by the impetus of the bike's flight, then the sidecar began \nto lose height \u2013 \n\nIn desperation Harry pointed his wand at the sidecar and shouted, \"Wingardium \nLeviosa!\" \n\nThe sidecar rose like a cork, unsteerable but at least still airborne. He had but a \nsplit second's relief, however, as more curses streaked past him: The three Death Eaters \nwere closing in. \n\n\"I'm comin', Harry!\" Hagrid yelled from out of the darkness, but Harry could feel \nthe sidecar beginning to sink again: Crouching as low as he could, he pointed at the \nmiddle of the oncoming figures and yelled, \"Impedimenta!\" \n\nThe jinx hit the middle Death Eater in the chest; For a moment the man was \nabsurdly spread-eagled in midair as though he had hit an invisible barrier: One of his \nfellows almost collided with him \u2013 \n\nThen the sidecar began to fall in earnest, and the remaining Death Eater shot a \ncurse so close to Harry that he had to duck below the rim of the car, knocking out a tooth \non the edge of his seat \u2013 \n\n\"I'm comin', Harry, I'm comin'!\" \n\nA huge hand seized the back of Harry's robes and hoisted him out of the \nplummeting sidecar; Harry pulled his rucksack with him as he dragged himself onto the \nmotorbike's seat and found himself back-to-back with Hagrid. As they soared upward, \naway from the two remaining Death Eaters, Harry spat blood out of his mouth, pointed \nhis wand at the falling sidecar, and yelled, \"Confringo!\" \n\nHe knew a dreadful, gut-wrenching pang for Hedwig as it exploded; the Death \nEater nearest it was blasted off his broom and fell from sight; his companion fell back \nand vanished. \n\n\"Harry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,\" moaned Hagrid, \"I shouldn'ta tried ter repair it \nmeself \u2013 yeh've got no room \u2013\" \n\n\"It's not a problem, just keep flying!\" Harry shouted back, as two more Death \nEaters emerged out of the darkness, drawing closer. \n\nAs the curses came shooting across the intervening space again, Hagrid swerved \nand zigzagged: Harry knew that Hagrid did not dare use the dragon-fire button again, \nwith Harry seated so insecurely. Harry sent Stunning Spell after Stunning Spell back at \ntheir pursuers, barely holding them off. He shot another blocking jinx at them: The \nclosest Death Eater swerved to avoid it and his hood slipped, and by the red light of his \nnext Stunning Spell, Harry saw the strangely blank face of Stanley Shunpike \u2013 Stan \u2013 \n\n\"Expelliarmus!\" Harry yelled. \n\n\f\n\"That's him, it's him, it's the real one!\" \n\nThe hooded Death Eater's shout reached Harry even above the thunder of the \nmotorbike's engine: Next moment, both pursuers had fallen back and disappeared from \nview. \n\n\"Harry, what's happened?\" bellowed Hagrid. \"Where've they gone?\" \n\n\"I don't know!\" \n\nBut Harry was afraid: The hooded Death Eater had shouted, \"It's the real one!\"; \nhow had he known? He gazed around at the apparently empty darkness and felt its \nmenace. Where were they? \n\nHe clambered around on the seat to face forward and seized hold of the back of \nHagrid's jacket. \n\n\"Hagrid, do the dragon-fire thing again, let's get out of here!\" \n\n\"Hold on tight, then, Harry!\" \n\nThere was a deafening, screeching roar again and the white-blue fire shot from the \nexhaust: Harry felt himself slipping backwards off what little of the seat he had. Hagrid \nflung backward upon him, barely maintaining his grip on the handlebars \u2013 \n\n\"I think we've lost 'em Harry, I think we've done it!\" yelled Hagrid. \n\nBut Harry was not convinced; Fear lapped at him as he looked left and right for \npursuers he was sure would come. . . . Why had they fallen back? One of them had still \nhad a wand. . . . It's him. . . it's the real one. . . . They had said it right after he had tried to \nDisarm Stan. . . . \n\n\"We're nearly there, Harry, we've nearly made it!\" shouted Hagrid. \n\nHarry felt the bike drop a little, though the lights down on the ground still seemed \nremote as stars. \n\nThen the scar on his forehead burned like fire: as a Death Eater appeared on either \nside of the bike, two Killing Curses missed Harry by millimeters, cast from behind \u2013 \n\nAnd then Harry saw him. Voldemort was flying like smoke on the wind, without \nbroomstick or thestral to hold him, his snake-like face gleaming out of the blackness, his \nwhite fingers raising his wand again \u2013 \n\nHagrid let out a bellow of fear and steered the motorbike into a vertical dive. \nClinging on for dear life, Harry sent Stunning Spells flying at random into the whirling \nnight. He saw a body fly past him and knew he had hit one of them, but then he heard a \nbang and saw sparks from the engine; the motorbike spiraled through the air, completely \nout of control \u2013 \n\nGreen jets of light shot past them again. Harry had no idea which way was up, \nwhich down: His scar was still burning; he expected to die at any second. A hooded \nfigure on a broomstick was feet from him, he saw it raise its arm \u2013 \n\n\"NO!\" \n\nWith a shout of fury Hagrid launched himself off the bike at the Death Eater; to \nhis horror, Harry saw both Hagrid and the Death Eater, falling out of sight, their \ncombined weight too much for the broomstick \u2013 \n\nBarely gripping the plummeting bike with his knees, Harry heard Voldemort \nscream, \"Mine!\" \n\nIt was over: He could not see or hear where Voldemort was; he glimpsed another \nDeath Eater swooping out of the way and heard, \"Avada \u2013\" \n\n\f\nAs the pain from Harry's scar forced his eyes shut, his wand acted of its own \naccord. He felt it drag his hand around like some great magnet, saw a spurt of golden fire \nthrough his half-closed eyelids, heard a crack and a scream of fury. The remaining Death \nEater yelled; Voldemort screamed, \"NO!\" Somehow, Harry found his nose an inch from \nthe dragon-fire button. He punched it with his wand-free hand and the bike shot more \nflames into the air, hurtling straight toward the ground. \n\n\"Hagrid!\" Harry called, holding on to the bike for dear life. \"Hagrid \u2013 Accio \nHagrid!\" \n\nThe motorbike sped up, sucked towards the earth. Face level with the handlebars, \nHarry could see nothing but distant lights growing nearer and nearer: He was going to \ncrash and there was nothing he could do about it. Behind him came another scream, \n\"Your wand, Selwyn, give me your wand!\" \n\nHe felt Voldemort before he saw him. Looking sideways, he stared into the red \neyes and was sure they would be the last thing he ever saw: Voldemort preparing to curse \nhim once more \u2013 \n\nAnd then Voldemort vanished. Harry looked down and saw Hagrid spread-eagled \non the ground below him. He pulled hard at the handlebars to avoid hitting him, groped \nfor the brake, but with an earsplitting, ground trembling crash, he smashed into a muddy \npond. \n\n \n\nChapter Five \n\nFallen Warrior \n\n \n\n\"Hagrid?\" \n\n Harry struggled to raise himself out of the debris of metal and leather that \nsurrounded him; his hands sank into inches of muddy water as he tried to stand. He could \nnot understand where Voldemort had gone and expected him to swoop out of the \ndarkness at any moment. Something hot and wet was trickling down his chin and from \nhis forehead. He crawled out of the pond and stumbled toward the great dark mass on the \nground that was Hagrid. \n\n \"Hagrid? Hagrid, talk to me \u2013\" \n\n But the dark mass did not stir. \n\n \"Who's there? Is it Potter? Are you Harry Potter?\" \n\n Harry did not recognize the man's voice. Then a woman shouted. \"They've \ncrashed. Ted! Crashed in the garden!\" \n\n Harry's head was swimming. \n\n \"Hagrid,\" he repeated stupidly, and his knees buckled. \n\n The next thing he knew, he was lying on his back on what felt like cushions, with \na burning sensation in his ribs and right arm. His missing tooth had been regrown. The \nscar on his forehead was still throbbing. \n\n \"Hagrid?\" \n\n He opened his eyes and saw that he was lying on a sofa in an unfamiliar, lamplit \nsitting room. His rucksack lay on the floor a short distance away, wet and muddy. A fair-\nhaired, big-bellied man was watching Harry anxiously. \n\n\f\n \"Hagrid's fine, son,\" said the man, \"the wife's seeing to him now. How are you \nfeeling? Anything else broken? I've fixed your ribs, your tooth, and your arm. I'm Ted, by \nthe way, Ted Tonks \u2013 Dora's father.\" \n\n Harry sat up too quickly. Lights popped in front of his eyes and he felt sick and \ngiddy. \n\n \"Voldemort \u2013\" \n\n \"Easy, now,\" said Ted Tonks, placing a hand on Harry's shoulder and pushing him \nback against the cushions. \"That was a nasty crash you just had. What happened, \nanyway? Something go wrong with the bike? Arthur Weasley overstretch himself again, \nhim and his Muggle contraptions?\" \n\n \"No,\" said Harry, as his scar pulsed like an open wound. \"Death Eaters, loads of \nthem \u2013 we were chased \u2013\" \n\n \"Death Eaters?\" said Ted sharply. \"What d'you mean, Death Eaters? I thought \nthey didn't know you were being moved tonight, I thought \u2013\" \n\n \"They knew,\" said Harry. \n\n Ted Tonks looked up at the ceiling as though he could see through it to the sky \nabove. \n\n \"Well, we know our protective charms hold, then, don't we? They shouldn't be \nable to get within a hundred yards of the place in any direction.\" \n\n Now Harry understood why Voldemort had vanished; it had been at the point \nwhen the motorbike crossed the barrier of the Order's charms. He only hoped they would \ncontinue to work: He imagined Voldemort, a hundred yards above them as they spoke, \nlooking for a way to penetrate what Harry visualized as a great transparent bubble. \n\n He swung his legs off the sofa; he needed to see Hagrid with his own eyes before \nhe would believe that he was alive. He had barely stood up, however, when a door \nopened and Hagrid squeezed through it, his face covered in mud and blood, limping a \nlittle but miraculously alive. \n\n \"Harry!\" \n\n Knocking over two delicate tables and an aspidistra, he covered the floor between \nthem in two strides and pulled Harry into a hug that nearly cracked his newly repaired \nribs. \"Blimey, Harry, how did yeh get out o' that? I thought we were both goners.\" \n\n \"Yeah, me too. I can't believe \u2013\" \n\n Harry broke off. He had just noticed the woman who had entered the room behind \nHagrid. \n\n \"You!\" he shouted, and he thrust his hand into his pocket, but it was empty. \n\n \"Your wand's here, son,\" said Ted, tapping it on Harry's arm. \"It fell right beside \nyou, I picked it up\u2026And that's my wife you're shouting at.\" \n\n \"Oh, I'm \u2013 I'm sorry.\" \n\n As she moved forward into the room, Mrs. Tonks's resemblance to her sister \nBellatrix became much less pronounced: Her hair was a light\u2019s oft brown and her eyes \nwere wider and kinder. Nevertheless, she looked a little haughty after Harry's \nexclamation. \n\n \"What happened to our daughter?\" she asked. \"Hagrid said you were ambushed; \nwhere is Nymphadora?\" \n\n \"I don't know,\" said Harry. \"We don't know what happened to anyone else.\" \n\n\f\n She and Ted exchanged looks. A mixture of fear and guilt gripped Harry at the \nsight of their expressions, if any of the others had died, it was his fault, all his fault. He \nhad consented to the plan, given them his hair . . . \n\n \"The Portkey,\" he said, remembering all of a sudden. \"We've got to get back to \nthe Burrow and find out \u2013 then we'll be able to send you word, or \u2013 or Tonks will, once \nshe's \u2013\" \n\n \"Dora'll be ok, 'Dromeda,\" said Ted. \"She knows her stuff, she's been in plenty of \ntight spots with the Aurors. The Portkey's through here,\" he added to Harry. \"It's \nsupposed to leave in three minutes, if you want to take it.\" \n\n \"Yeah, we do,\" said Harry. He seized his rucksack, swung it onto his shoulders. \"I \n\u2013\" \n\n He looked at Mrs. Tonks, wanting to apologize for the state of fear in which he \nleft her and for which he felt so terribly responsible, but no words occurred to him that he \ndid not seem hollow and insincere. \n\n \"I'll tell Tonks \u2013 Dora \u2013 to send word, when she . . . Thanks for patching us up, \nthanks for everything, I \u2013\" \n\n He was glad to leave the room and follow Ted Tonks along a short hallway and \ninto a bedroom. Hagrid came after them, bending low to avoid hitting his head on the \ndoor lintel. \n\n \"There you go, son. That's the Portkey.\" \n\n Mr. Tonks was pointing to a small, silver-backed hairbrush lying on the dressing \ntable. \n\n \"Thanks,\" said Harry, reaching out to place a finger on it, ready to leave. \n\n \"Wait a moment,\" said Hagrid, looking around. \"Harry, where's Hedwig?\" \n\n \"She . . . she got hit,\" said Harry. \n\n The realization crashed over him: He felt ashamed of himself as the tears stung \nhis eyes. The owl had been his companion, his one great link with the magical world \nwhenever he had been forced to return to the Dursleys. \n\n Hagrid reached out a great hand and patted him painfully on the shoulder. \n\n \"Never mind,\" he said gruffly, \"Never mind. She had a great old life \u2013\" \n\n \"Hagrid!\" said Ted Tonks warningly, as the hairbrush glowed bright blue, and \nHagrid only just got his forefinger to it in time. \n\n With a jerk behind the navel as though an invisible hook and line had dragged \nhim forward, Harry was pulled into nothingness, spinning uncontrollably, his finger glued \nto the Portkey as he and Hagrid hurtled away from Mr. Tonks. Second later, Harry's feet \nslammed onto hard ground and he fell onto his hands and knees in the yard of the Burrow. \nHe heard screams. Throwing aside the no longer glowing hairbrush, Harry stood up, \nswaying slightly, and saw Mrs. Weasley and Ginny running down the steps by the back \ndoor as Hagrid, who had also collapsed on landing, clambered laboriously to his feet. \n\n \"Harry? You are the real Harry? What happened? Where are the others?\" cried \nMrs. Weasley. \n\n \"What d'you mean? Isn't anyone else back?\" Harry panted. \n\n The answer was clearly etched in Mrs. Weasley's pale face. \n\n \"The Death Eaters were waiting for us,\" Harry told her, \"We were surrounded the \nmoment we took off \u2013 they knew it was tonight \u2013 I don't know what happened to anyone \n\n\f\nelse, four of them chased us, it was all we could do to get away, and then Voldemort \ncaught up with us \u2013\" \n\n He could hear the self-justifying note in his voice, the plea for her to understand \nwhy he did not know what had happened to her sons, but \u2013 \n\n \"Thank goodness you're all right,\" she said, pulling him into a hug he did not feel \nhe deserved. \n\n \"Haven't go' any brandy, have yeh, Molly?\" asked Hagrid a little shakily, \"Fer \nmedicinal purposes?\" \n\n She could have summoned it by magic, but as she hurried back toward the \ncrooked house, Harry knew that she wanted to hide her face. He turned to Ginny and she \nanswered his unspoken plea for information at once. \n\n \"Ron and Tonks should have been back first, but they missed their Portkey, it \ncame back without them,\" she said, pointing at a rusty oil can lying on the ground nearby. \n\"And that one,\" she pointed at an ancient sneaker, \"should have been Dad and Fred's, \nthey were supposed to be second. You and Hagrid were third and,\" she checked her \nwatch, \"if they made it, George and Lupin aught to be back in about a minute.\" \n\n Mrs. Weasley reappeared carrying a bottle of brandy, which she handed to Hagrid. \nHe uncorked it and drank it straight down in one. \n\n \"Mum!\" shouted Ginny pointing to a spot several feet away. \n\n A blue light had appeared in the darkness: It grew larger and brighter, and Lupin \nand George appeared, spinning and then falling. Harry knew immediately that there was \nsomething wrong: Lupin was supporting George, who was unconscious and whose face \nwas covered in blood. \n\n Harry ran forward and seized George's legs. Together, he and Lupin carried \nGeorge into the house and through the kitchen to the living room, where they laid him on \nthe sofa. As the lamplight fell across George's head, Ginny gasped and Harry's stomach \nlurched: One of George's ears was missing. The side of his head and neck were drenched \nin wet, shockingly scarlet blood. \n\n No sooner had Mrs. Weasley bent over her son that Lupin grabbed Harry by the \nupper arm and dragged him, none too gently, back into the kitchen, where Hagrid was \nstill attempting to ease his bulk through the back door. \n\n \"Oi!\" said Hagrid indignantly, \"Le' go of him! Le' go of Harry!\" \n\n Lupin ignored him. \n\n \"What creature sat in the corner the first time that Harry Potter visited my office \nat Hogwarts?\" he said, giving Harry a small shake. \"Answer me!\" \n\n \"A \u2013 a grindylow in a tank, wasn't it?\" \n\n Lupin released Harry and fell back against a kitchen cupboard. \n\n \"Wha' was tha' about?\" roared Hagrid. \n\n \"I'm sorry, Harry, but I had to check,\" said Lupin tersely. \"We've been betrayed. \nVoldemort knew that you were being moved tonight and the only people who could have \ntold him were directly involved in the plan. You might have been an impostor.\" \n\n \"So why aren' you checkin' me?\" panted Hagrid, still struggling with the door. \n\n \"You're half-giant,\" said Lupin, looking up at Hagrid. \"The Polyjuice Potion is \ndesigned for human use only.\" \n\n \"None of the Order would have told Voldemort we were moving tonight,\" said \nHarry. The idea was dreadful to him, he could not believe it of any of them. \"Voldemort \n\n\f\nonly caught up with me toward the end, he didn't know which one I was in the beginning. \nIf he'd been in on the plan he'd have known from the start I was the one with Hagrid.\" \n\n \"Voldemort caught up with you?\" said Lupin sharply. \"What happened? How did \nyou escape?\" \n\n Harry explained how the Death Eaters pursuing them had seemed to recognize \nhim as the true Harry, how they had abandoned the chase, how they must have \nsummoned Voldemort, who had appeared just before he and Hagrid had reached the \nsanctuary of Tonks's parents. \n\n \"They recognized you? But how? What had you done?\" \n\n \"I . . .\" Harry tried to remember; the whole journey seemed like a blur of panic \nand confusion. \"I saw Stan Shunpike . . . . You know, the bloke who was the conductor \non the Knight Bus? And I tried to Disarm him instead of \u2013 well, he doesn't know what \nhe's doing, does he? He must be Imperiused!\" \n\n Lupin looked aghast. \n\n \"Harry, the time for Disarming is past! These people are trying to capture and kill \nyou! At least Stun if you aren't prepared to kill!\" \n\n \"We were hundreds of feet up! Stan's not himself, and if I Stunned him and he'd \nfallen, he'd have died the same as if I'd used Avada Kedavra! Expelliarmus saved me \nfrom Voldemort two years ago,\" Harry added defiantly. Lupin was reminding him of the \nsneering Hufflepuff Zacharias Smith, who had jeered at Harry for wanting to teach \nDumbledore's Army how to Disarm. \n\n \"Yes, Harry,\" said Lupin with painful restraint, \"and a great number of Death \nEaters witnessed that happening! Forgive me, but it was a very unusual move then, under \nthe imminent threat of death. Repeating it tonight in front of Death Eaters who either \nwitnessed or heard about the first occasion was close to suicidal!\" \n\n \"So you think I should have killed Stan Shunpike?\" said Harry angrily. \n\n \"Of course not,\" said Lupin, \"but the Death Eaters \u2013 frankly, most people! \u2013 \nwould have expected you to attack back! Expelliarmus is a useful spell, Harry, but the \nDeath Eaters seem to think it is your signature move, and I urge you not to let it become \nso!\" \n\n Lupin was making Harry feel idiotic, and yet there was still a grain of defiance \ninside him. \n\n \"I won't blast people out of my way just because they're there,\" said Harry, \"That's \nVoldemort's job.\" \n\n Lupin's retort was lost: Finally succeeding in squeezing through the door, Hagrid \nstaggered to a chair and sat down; it collapsed beneath him. Ignoring his mingled oaths \nand apologies, Harry addressed Lupin again. \n\n \"Will George be okay?\" \n\n All Lupin's frustration with Harry seemed to drain away at the question. \n\n \"I think so, although there's no chance of replacing his ear, not when it's been \ncursed off \u2013\" \n\n There was a scuffling from outside. Lupin dived for the back door; Harry leapt \nover Hagrid's legs and sprinted into the yard. \n\n Two figures had appeared in the yard, and as Harry ran toward them he realized \nthey were Hermione, now returning to her normal appearance, and Kingsley, both \nclutching a bent coat hanger, Hermione flung herself into Harry's arms, but Kingsley \n\n\f\nshowed no pleasure at the sight of any of them. Over Hermione's shoulder Harry saw him \nraise his wand and point it at Lupin's chest. \n\n \"The last words Albus Dumbledore spoke to the pair of us!\" \n\n \"'Harry is the best hope we have. Trust him,'\" said Lupin calmly. \n\n Kingsley turned his wand on Harry, but Lupin said, \"It's him, I've checked!\" \n\n \"All right, all right!\" said Kingsley, stowing his wand back beneath his cloak, \n\"But somebody betrayed us! They knew, they knew it was tonight!\" \n\n \"So it seems,\" replied Lupin, \"but apparently they did not realize that there would \nbe seven Harrys.\" \n\n \"Small comfort!\" snarled Kingsley. \"Who else is back?\" \n\n \"Only Harry, Hagrid, George, and me.\" \n\n Hermione stifled a little moan behind her hand. \n\n \"What happened to you?\" Lupin asked Kingsley. \n\n \"Followed by five, injured two, might've killed one,\" Kingsley reeled off, \"and we \nsaw You-Know-Who as well, he joined the chase halfway through but vanished pretty \nquickly. Remus, he can \u2013\" \n\n \"Fly,\" supplied Harry. \"I saw him too, he came after Hagrid and me.\" \n\n \"So that's why he left, to follow you!\" said Kingsley, \"I couldn't understand why \nhe'd vanished. But what made him change targets?\" \n\n \"Harry behaved a little too kindly to Stan Shunpike,\" said Lupin. \n\n \"Stan?\" repeated Hermione. \"But I thought he was in Azkaban?\" \n\n Kingsley let out a mirthless laugh. \n\n \"Hermione, there's obviously been a mass breakout which the Ministry has \nhushed up. Travers's hood fell off when I cursed him, he's supposed to be inside too. But \nwhat happened to you, Remus? Where's George?\" \n\n \"He lost an ear,\" said Lupin. \n\n \"lost an -- ?\" repeated Hermione in a high voice. \n\n \"Snape's work,\" said Lupin. \n\n \"Snape?\" shouted Harry. \"You didn't say \u2013\" \n\n \"He lost his hood during the chase. Sectumsempra was always a specialty of \nSnape's. I wish I could say I'd paid him back in kind, but it was all I could do to keep \nGeorge on the broom after he was injured, he was losing so much blood.\" \n\n Silence fell between the four of them as they looked up at the sky. There was no \nsign of movement; the stars stared back, unblinking, indifferent, unobscured by flying \nfriends. Where was Ron? Where were Fred and Mr. Weasley? Where were Bill, Fleur, \nTonks, Mad-Eye, and Mundungus? \n\n \"Harry, give us a hand!\" called Hagrid hoarsely from the door, in which he was \nstuck again. Glad of something to do, Harry pulled him free, the headed through the \nempty kitchen and back into the sitting room, where Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were still \ntending to George. Mrs. Weasley had staunched his bleeding now, and by the lamplight \nHarry saw a clean gaping hole where George's ear had been. \n\n \"How is he?\" \n\n Mrs. Weasley looked around and said, \"I can't make it grow back, not when it's \nbeen removed by Dark Magic. But it could've been so much worse . . . . He's alive.\" \n\n \"Yeah,\" said Harry. \"Thank God.\" \n\n \"Did I hear someone else in the yard?\" Ginny asked. \n\n\f\n \"Hermione and Kingsley,\" said Harry. \n\n \"Thank goodness,\" Ginny whispered. They looked at each other; Harry wanted to \nhug her, hold on to her; he did not even care much that Mrs. Weasley was there, but \nbefore he could act on the impulse, there was a great crash from the kitchen. \n\n \"I'll prove who I am, Kingsley, after I've seen my son, now back off if you know \nwhat's good for you!\" \n\n Harry had never heard Mr. Weasley shout like that before. He burst into the living \nroom, his bald patch gleaming with sweat, his spectacles askew, Fred right behind him, \nboth pale but uninjured. \n\n \"Arthur!\" sobbed Mrs. Weasley. \"Oh thank goodness!\" \n\n \"How is he?\" \n\n Mr. Weasley dropped to his knees beside George. For the first time since Harry \nhad known him, Fred seemed to be lost for words. He gaped over the back of the sofa at \nhis twin's wound as if he could not believe what he was seeing. \n\n Perhaps roused by the sound of Fred and their father's arrival, George stirred. \n\n \"How do you feel, Georgie?\" whispered Mrs. Weasley. \n\n George's fingers groped for the side of his head. \n\n \"Saintlike,\" he murmured. \n\n \"What's wrong with him?\" croaked Fred, looking terrified. \"Is his mind affected?\" \n\n \"Saintlike,\" repeated George, opening his eyes and looking up at his brother. \n\"You see. . . I'm holy. Holey, Fred, geddit?\" \n\n Mrs. Weasley sobbed harder than ever. Color flooded Fred's pale face. \n\n \"Pathetic,\" he told George. \"Pathetic! With the whole wide world of ear-related \nhumor before you, you go for holey?\" \n\n \"Ah well,\" said George, grinning at his tear-soaked mother. \"You'll be able to tell \nus apart now, anyway, Mum.\" \n\n He looked around. \n\n \"Hi, Harry \u2013 you are Harry, right?\" \n\n \"Yeah, I am,\" said Harry, moving closer to the sofa. \n\n \"Well, at least we got you back okay,\" said George. \"Why aren't Ron and Bill \nhuddled round my sickbed?\" \n\n \"They're not back yet, George,\" said Mrs. Weasley. George's grin faded. Harry \nglanced at Ginny and motioned to her to accompany him back outside. As they walked \nthrough the kitchen she said in a low voice. \n\n \"Ron and Tonks should be back by now. They didn't have a long journey; Auntie \nMuriel's not that far from here.\" \n\n Harry said nothing. He had been trying to keep fear at bay ever since reaching the \nBurrow, but now it enveloped him, seeming to crawl over his skin, throbbing in his chest, \nclogging his throat. As they walked down the back steps into the dark yard, Ginny took \nhis hand. \n\n Kingsley was striding backward and forward, glancing up at the sky every time he \nturned. Harry was reminded of Uncle Vernon pacing the living room a million years ago. \nHagrid, Hermione, and Lupin stood shoulder to shoulder, gazing upward in silence. None \nof them looked around when Harry and Ginny joined their silent vigil. \n\n\f\n The minutes stretched into what might as well have been years. The slightest \nbreath of wind made them all jump and turn toward the whispering bush or tree in the \nhope that one of the missing Order members might leap unscathed from its leaves \u2013 \n\n And then a broom materialized directly above them and streaked toward the \nground \u2013 \n\n \"It's them!\" screamed Hermione. \n\n Tonks landed in a long skid that sent earth and pebbles everywhere. \n\n \"Remus!\" Tonks cried as she staggered off the broom into Lupin's arms. His face \nwas set and white: He seemed unable to speak, Ron tripped dazedly toward Harry and \nHermione. \n\n \"You're okay,\" he mumbled, before Hermione flew at him and hugged him tightly. \n\n \"I thought \u2013 I thought \u2013\" \n\n \"'M all right,\" said Ron, patting her on the back. \"'M fine.\" \n\n \"Ron was great,\" said Tonks warmly, relinquishing her hold on Lupin. \n\"Wonderful. Stunned one of the Death Eaters, straight to the head, and when you're \naiming at a moving target from a flying broom \u2013\" \n\n \"You did?\" said Hermione, gazing up at Ron with her arms still around his neck. \n\n \"Always the tone of surprise,\" he said a little grumpily, breaking free. \"Are we the \nlast back?\" \n\n \"No,\" said Ginny, \"we're still waiting for Bill and Fleur and Mad-Eye and \nMundungus. I'm going to tell Mum and Dad you're okay, Ron \u2013\" \n\n She ran back inside. \n\n \"So what kept you? What happened?\" Lupin sounded almost angry at Tonks. \n\n \"Bellatrix,\" said Tonks. \"She wants me quite as much as she wants Harry, Remus, \nShe tried very hard to kill me. I just wish I'd got her, I owe Bellatrix. But we definitely \ninjured Rodolphus . . . . Then we got to Ron's Auntie Muriel's and we missed our Portkey \nand she was fussing over us \u2013\" \n\n A muscle was jumping in Lupin's jaw. He nodded, but seemed unable to say \nanything else. \n\n \"So what happened to you lot?\" Tonks asked, turning to Harry, Hermione, and \nKingsley. \n\n They recounted the stories of their own journeys, but all the time the continued \nabsence of Bill, Fleur, Mad-Eye, and Mundungus seemed to lie upon them like a frost, its \nicy bite harder and harder to ignore. \n\n \"I'm going to have to get back to Downing Street, I should have been there an \nhour ago,\" said Kingsley finally, after a last sweeping gaze at the sky. \"Let me know \nwhen they're back,.\" \n\n Lupin nodded. With a wave to the others, Kingsley walked away into the darkness \ntoward the gate. Harry thought he heard the faintest pop as Kingsley Disapparated just \nbeyond the Burrow's boundaries. \n\n Mr. And Mrs. Weasley came racing down the back steps, Ginny behind them. \nBoth parents hugged Ron before turning to Lupin and Tonks. \n\n \"Thank you,\" said Mrs. Weasley, \"for our sons.\" \n\n \"Don't be silly, Molly,\" said Tonks at once. \n\n \"How's George?\" asked Lupin. \n\n \"What's wrong with him?\" piped up Ron. \n\n\f\n \"He's lost \u2013\" \n\n But the end of Mrs. Weasley's sentence was drowned in a general outcry. A \nthestral had just soared into sight and landed a few feet from them. Bill and Fleur slid \nfrom its back, windswept but unhurt. \n\n \"Bill! Thank God, thank God \u2013\" \n\n Mrs. Weasley ran forward, but the hug Bill bestowed upon her was perfunctory. \nLooking directly at his father, he said, \"Mad-Eye's dead.\" \n\n Nobody spoke, nobody moved. Harry felt as though something inside him was \nfalling, falling through the earth, leaving him forever. \n\n \"We saw it,\" said Bill; Fleur nodded, tear tracks glittering on her cheeks in the \nlight from the kitchen window. \"It happened just after we broke out of the circle: Mad-\nEye and Dung were close by us, they were heading north too. Voldemort \u2013 he can fly \u2013 \nwent straight for them. Dung panicked, I heard him cry out, Mad-Eye tried to stop him, \nbut he Disapparated. Voldemort's curse hit Mad-Eye full in the face, he fell backward off \nhis broom and \u2013 there was nothing we could do, nothing, we had half a dozen of them on \nour own tail \u2013\" \n\n Bill's voice broke. \n\n \"Of course you couldn't have done anything,\" said Lupin. \n\n They all stood looking at each other. Harry could not quite comprehend it. Mad-\nEye dead; it could not be . . . . Mad-Eye, so tough, so brave, the consummate survivor . . . \n\n At last it seemed to dawn on everyone, though nobody said it, that there was no \npoint of waiting in the yard anymore, and in silence they followed Mr. And Mrs. Weasley \nback into the Burrow, and into the living room, where Fred and George were laughing \ntogether. \n\n \"What's wrong?\" said Fred, scanning their faces as they entered, \"What's \nhappened? Who's --?\" \n\n \"Mad-Eye,\" said Mr. Weasley, \"Dead.\" \n\n The twins' grins turned to grimaces of shock. Nobody seemed to know what to do. \nTonks was crying silently into a handkerchief: She had been close to Mad-Eye, Harry \nknew, his favorite and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9e at the Ministry of Magic. Hagrid, who had sat down \non the floor in the corner where he had most space, was dabbing at his eyes with his \ntablecloth-sized handkerchief. \n\n Bill walked over to the sideboard and pulled out a bottle of fire-whisky and some \nglasses. \n\n \"Here,\" he said, and with a wave of his wand, eh sent twelve full glasses soaring \nthrough the room to each of them, holding the thirteenth aloft. \"Mad-Eye.\" \n\n \"Mad-Eye,\" they all said, and drank. \n\n \"Mad-Eye,\" echoed Hagrid, a little late, with a hiccup. The firewhisky seared \nHarry's throat. It seemed to burn feeling back into him, dispelling the numbness and \nsense of unreality firing him with something that was like courage. \n\n \"So Mundungus disappeared?\" said Lupin, who had drained his own glass in one. \n\n The atmosphere changed at once. Everybody looked tense, watching Lupin, both \nwanting him to go on, it seemed to Harry, and slightly afraid of what they might hear. \n\n \"I know what you're thinking,\" said Bill, \"and I wondered that too, on the way \nback here, because they seemed to be expecting us, didn't they? But Mundungus can't \nhave betrayed us. They didn't know there would be seven Harrys, that confused them the \n\n\f\nmoment we appeared, and in case you've forgotten, it was Mundungus who suggested \nthat little bit of skullduggery. Why wouldn't he have told them the essential point? I think \nDung panicked, it's as simple as that. He didn't want to come in the first place, but Mad-\nEye made him, and You-Know-Who went straight for them. It was enough to make \nanyone panic.\" \n\n \"You-Know-Who acted exactly as Mad-Eye expected him to,\" sniffed Tonks. \n\"Mad-Eye said he'd expect the real Harry to be with the toughest, most skilled Aurors. He \nchased Mad-Eye first, and when Mundungus gave them away he switched to \nKingsley. . . . \" \n\n \"Yes, and zat eez all very good,\" snapped Fleur, \"but still eet does not explain 'ow \nzey know we were moving 'Arry tonight, does eet? Somebody must 'ave been careless. \nSomebody let slip ze date to an outsider. It is ze only explanation for zem knowing ze \ndate but not ze 'ole plan.\" \n\n She glared around at them all, tear tracks still etched on her beautiful face, silently \ndaring any of them to contradict her. Nobody did. The only sound to break the silence \nwas that of Hagrid hiccupping from behind his handkerchief. Harry glanced at Hagrid, \nwho had just risked his own life to save Harry's \u2013 Hagrid, whom he loved, whom he \ntrusted, who had once been tricked into giving Voldemort crucial information in \nexchange for a dragon's egg. . . . \n\n \"No,\" Harry said aloud, and they all looked at him, surprised: The firewhisky \nseemed to have amplified his voice. \"I mean . . . if somebody made a mistake,\" Harry \nwent on, \"and let something slip, I know they didn't mean to do it. It's not their fault,\" he \nrepeated, again a little louder than he would usually have spoken. \"We've got to trust each \nother. I trust all of you, I don't think anyone in this room would ever sell me to \nVoldemort.\" \n\n More silence followed his words. They were all looking at him; Harry felt a little \nhot again, and drank some more firewhisky for something to do. As he drank, he thought \nof Mad-Eye. Mad-Eye had always been scathing about Dumbledore's willingness to trust \npeople. \n\n \"Well said, Harry,\" said Fred unexpectedly. \n\n \"Year, 'ear, 'ear,\" said George, with half a glance at Fred, the corner of whose \nmouth twitched. \n\n Lupin was wearing an odd expression as he looked at Harry. It was close to \npitying. \n\n \"You think I'm a fool?\" demanded Harry. \n\n \"No, I think you're like James,\" said Lupin, \"who would have regarded it as the \nheight of dishonor to mistrust his friends.\" \n\n Harry knew what Lupin was getting at: that his father had been betrayed by his \nfriend Peter Pettigrew. He felt irrationally angry. He wanted to argue, but Lupin had \nturned away from him, set down his glass upon a side table, and addressed Bill, \"There's \nwork to do. I can ask Kingsley whether \u2013\" \n\n \"No,\" said Bill at once, \"I'll do it, I'll come.\" \n\n \"Where are you going?\" said Tonks and Fleur together. \n\n \"Mad-Eye's body,\" said Lupin. \"We need to recover it.\" \n\n \"Can't it -- ?\" began Mrs. Weasley with an appealing look at Bill. \n\n \"Wait?\" said Bill, \"Not unless you'd rather the Death Eaters took it?\" \n\n\f\n Nobody spoke. Lupin and Bill said good bye and left. \n\n The rest of them now dropped into chairs, all except for Harry, who remained \nstanding. The suddenness and completeness of death was with them like a presence. \n\n \"I've got to go too,\" said Harry. \n\n Ten pairs of startled eyes looked at him. \n\n \"Don't be silly, Harry,\" said Mrs. Weasley, \"What are you talking about?\" \n\n \"I can't stay here.\" \n\n He rubbed his forehead; it was prickling again, he had not hurt like this for more \nthan a year. \n\n \"You're all in danger while I'm here. I don't want \u2013\" \n\n \"But don't be so silly!\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"The whole point of tonight was to get \nyou here safely, and thank goodness it worked. And Fleur's agreed to get married here \nrather than in France, we've arranged everything so that we can all stay together and look \nafter you \u2013\" \n\n She did not understand; she was making him feel worse, not better. \n\n \"If Voldemort finds out I'm here \u2013\" \n\n \"But why should he?\" asked Mrs. Weasley. \n\n \"There are a dozen places you might be now, Harry,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"He's got \nno way of knowing which safe house you're in.\" \n\n \"It's not me I'm worried for!\" said Harry. \n\n \"We know that,\" said Mr. Weasley quietly, but it would make our efforts tonight \nseem rather pointless if you left.\" \n\n \"Yer not goin' anywhere,\" growled Hagrid. \"Blimey, Harry, after all we wen' \nthrough ter get you here?\" \n\n \"Yeah, what about my bleeding ear?\" said George, hoisting himself up on his \ncushions. \n\n \"I know that \u2013\" \n\n \"Mad-Eye wouldn't want \u2013\" \n\n \"I KNOW!\" Harry bellowed. \n\n He felt beleaguered and blackmailed: Did they think he did not know what they \nhad done for him, didn't they understand that it was for precisely that reason that he \nwanted to go now, before they had to suffer any more on his behalf? There was a long \nand awkward silence in which his scar continued to prickle and throb, and which was \nbroken at last by Mrs. Weasley. \n\n \"Where's Hedwig, Harry?\" she said coaxingly. \"We can put her up with \nPidwidgeon and give her something to eat.\" \n\n His insides clenched like a fist. He could not tell her the truth. He drank the last of \nhis firewhisky to avoid answering. \n\n \"Wait till it gets out yeh did it again, Harry,\" said Hagrid. \"Escaped him, fought \nhim off when he was right on top of yeh!\" \n\n \"It wasn't me,\" said Harry flatly. \"It was my wand. My wand acted of its own \naccord.\" \n\n After a few moments, Hermione said gently, \"But that's impossible, Harry. You \nmean that you did magic without meaning to; you reacted instinctively.\" \n\n\f\n \"No,\" said Harry. \"The bike was falling, I couldn't have told you where \nVoldemort was, but my wand spun in my hand and found him and shot a spell at him, and \nit wasn't even a spell I recognized. I've never made gold flames appear before.\" \n\n \"Often,\" said Mr. Weasley, \"when you're in a pressured situation you can produce \nmagic you never dreamed of. Small children often find, before they're trained \u2013\" \n\n \"It wasn't like that,\" said Harry through gritted teeth. His scar was burning. He felt \nangry and frustrated; he hated the idea that they were all imagining him to have power to \nmatch Voldemort's. \n\n No one said anything. He knew that they did not believe him. Now that he came \nto think of it, he had never heard of a wand performing magic on its own before. \n\n His scar seared with pain, it was all he could do not to moan aloud. Muttering \nabout fresh air, he set down his glass and left the room. \n\n As he crossed the yard, the great skeletal thestral looked up \u2013 rustled its enormous \nbatlike wings, then resumed its grazing. Harry stopped at the gate into the garden, staring \nout at its overgrown plants, rubbing his pounding forehead and thinking of Dumbledore. \n\n Dumbledore would have believed him, he knew it. Dumbledore would have \nknown how and why Harry's wand had acted independently, because Dumbledore always \nhad the answers; he had known about wands, had explained to Harry the strange \nconnection that existed between his wand and Voldemort's . . . . But Dumbledore, like \nMad-Eye, like Sirius, like his parents, like his poor owl, all were gone where Harry could \nnever talk to them again. He felt a burning in his throat that had nothing to do with \nfirewhisky. . . . \n\n And then, out of nowhere, the pain in his scar peaked. As he clutched his forehead \nand closed his eyes, a voice screamed inside his head. \n\n \"You told me the problem would be solved by using another's wand!\" \n\n And into his mind burst the vision of an emaciated old man lying in rags upon a \nstone floor, screaming, a horrible drawn-out scream, a scream of unendurable agony. . . . \n\n \"No! No! I beg you, I beg you. . . .\" \n\n \"You lied to Lord Voldemort, Ollivander!\" \n\n \"I did not. . . . I swear I did not. . . .\" \n\n \"You sought to help Potter, to help him escape me!\" \n\n \"I swear I did not. . . . I believed a different wand would work. . . .\" \n\n \"Explain, then, what happened. Lucius's wand is destroyed!\" \n\n \"I cannot understand. . . . The connection . . . exists only . . between your two \nwands. . . .\" \n\n \"Lies!\" \n\n \"Please . . . I beg you. . . .\" \n\n And Harry saw the white hand raise its wand and felt Voldemort's surge of \nvicious anger, saw the frail old main on the floor writhe in agony \u2013 \n\n \"Harry?\" \n\n It was over as quickly as it had come: Harry stood shaking in the darkness, \nclutching the gate into the garden, his heart racing, his scar still tingling. It was several \nmoments before he realized that Ron and Hermione were at his side. \n\n \"Harry, come back in the house,\" Hermione whispered, \"You aren't still thinking \nof leaving?\" \n\n \"Yeah, you've got to stay, mate,\" said Ron, thumping Harry on the back. \n\n\f\n \"Are you all right?\" Hermione asked, close enough now to look into Harry's face. \n\"You look awful!\" \n\n \"Well,\" said Harry shakily, \"I probably look better than Ollivander. . . .\" \n\n When he had finished telling them what he had seen, Ron looked appalled, but \nHermione downright terrified. \n\n \"But it was supposed to have stopped! Your scar \u2013 it wasn't supposed to do this \nanymore! You mustn't let that connection open up again \u2013 Dumbledore wanted you to \nclose your mind!\" \n\n When he did not reply, she gripped his arm. \n\n \"Harry, he's taking over the Ministry and the newspapers and half the Wizarding \nworld! Don't let him inside your head too!\" \n\n \n\nChapter Six \n\nThe Ghoul in Pajamas \n\n \n\nThe shock of losing Mad-Eye hung over the house in the days that followed; \nHarry kept expecting to see him stumping in through the back door like the other Order \nmembers, who passed in and out to relay news. Harry felt that nothing but action would \nassuage his feelings of guilt and grief and that he ought to set out on his mission to find \nand destroy Horcruxes as soon as possible. \n\n\u201cWell, you can\u2019t do anything about the\u201d \u2013 Ron mouthed the word Horcruxes \u2013 \n\u201ctill you\u2019re seventeen. You\u2019ve still got the Trace on you. And we can plan here as well as \nanywhere, can\u2019t we? Or,\u201d he dropped his voice to a whisper, \u201cd\u2019you reckon you already \nknow where the You-Know-Whats are?\u201d \n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Harry admitted. \n\n\u201cI think Hermione\u2019s been doing a bit of research,\u201d said Ron. \u201cShe said she was \nsaving it for when you got here.\u201d \n\nThey were sitting at the breakfast table; Mr. Weasley and Bill had just left for \nwork. Mrs. Weasley had gone upstairs to wake Hermione and Ginny, while Fleur had \ndrifted off to take a bath. \n\n\u201cThe Trace\u2019ll break on the thirty-first,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThat means I only need to \nstay here four days. Then I can \u2013\u201c \n\n\u201cFive days,\u201d Ron corrected him firmly. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to stay for the wedding. \nThey\u2019ll kill us if we miss it.\u201d \n\nHarry understood \u201cthey\u201d to mean Fleur and Mrs. Weasley. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one extra day,\u201d said Ron, when Harry looked mutinous. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t they realize how important \u2013?\u201d \n\n\u201c\u2019Course they don\u2019t,\u201d said Ron. \u201cThey haven\u2019t got a clue. And now you mention \nit, I wanted to talk to you about that.\u201d \n\nRon glanced toward the door into the hall to check that Mrs. Weasley was not \nreturning yet, then leaned in closer to Harry. \n\n\u201cMum\u2019s been trying to get it out of Hermione and me. What we\u2019re off to do. \nShe\u2019ll try you next, so brace yourself. Dad and Lupin\u2019ve both asked as well, but when we \n\n\f\nsaid Dumbledore told you not to tell anyone except us, they dropped it. Not Mum, though. \nShe\u2019s determined.\u201d \n\nRon\u2019s prediction came true within hours. Shortly before lunch, Mrs. Weasley \ndetached Harry from the others by asking him to help identify a lone man\u2019s sock that she \nthought might have come out of his rucksack. Once she had him cornered in the tiny \nscullery off the kitchen, she started. \n\n\u201cRon and Hermione seem to think that the three of you are dropping out of \nHogwarts,\u201d she began in a light, casual tone. \n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWell, yeah. We are.\u201d \n\nThe mangle turned of its own accord in a corner, wringing out what looked like \none of Mr. Weasley\u2019s vests. \n\n\u201cMay I ask why you are abandoning your education?\u201d said Mrs. Weasley. \n\n\u201cWell, Dumbledore left me . . . stuff to do,\u201d mumbled Harry. \u201cRon and Hermione \nknow about it, and they want to come too.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat sort of \u2018stuff\u2019?\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t \u2013\u201c \n\n\u201cWell, frankly, I think Arthur and I have a right to know, and I\u2019m sure Mr. And \nMrs. Granger would agree!\u201d said Mrs. Weasley. Harry had been afraid of the \u201cconcerned \nparent\u201d attack. He forced himself to look directly into her eyes, noticing as he did so that \nthey were precisely the same shade of brown as Ginny\u2019s. This did not help. \n\n\u201cDumbledore didn\u2019t want anyone else to know, Mrs. Weasley. I\u2019m sorry. Ron and \nHermione don\u2019t have to come, it\u2019s their choice \u2013\u201c \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see that you have to go either!\u201d she snapped, dropping all pretense now. \n\u201cYou\u2019re barely of age, any of you! It\u2019s utter nonsense, if Dumbledore needed work doing, \nhe had the whole Order at his command! Harry, you must have misunderstood him. \nProbably he was telling you something he wanted done, and you took it to mean that he \nwanted you\u2013\u201c \n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t misunderstand,\u201d said Harry flatly. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be me.\u201d \n\nHe handed her back the single sock he was supposed to be identifying, which was \npatterned with golden bulrushes. \n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s not mine. I don\u2019t support Puddlemere United.\u201d \n\n\u201cOh, of course not,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley with a sudden and rather unnerving return \nto her casual tone. \u201cI should have realized. Well, Harry, while we\u2019ve still got you here, \nyou won\u2019t mind helping with the preparations for Bill and Fleur\u2019s wedding, will you? \nThere\u2019s still so much to do.\u201d \n\n\u201cNo \u2013 I \u2013 of course not,\u201d said Harry, disconcerted by this sudden change of \nsubject. \n\n\u201cSweet of you,\u201d she replied, and she smiled as she left the scullery. \n\nFrom that moment on, Mrs. Weasley kept Harry, Ron and Hermione so busy with \npreparations for the wedding that they hardly had any time to think. The kindest \nexplanation of this behavior would have been that Mrs. Weasley wanted to distract them \nall from thoughts of Mad-Eye and the terrors of their recent journey. After two days of \nnonstop cutlery cleaning, of color-matching favors, ribbons, and flowers, of de-gnoming \nthe garden and helping Mrs. Weasley cook vast batches of canap\u00e9s, however, Harry \nstarted to suspect her of a different motive. All the jobs she handed out seemed to keep \nhim, Ron, and Hermione away from one another; he had not had a chance to speak to the \n\n\f\ntwo of them alone since the first night, when he had told them about Voldemort torturing \nOllivander. \n\n\u201cI think Mum thinks that if she can stop the three of you getting together and \nplanning, she\u2019ll be able to delay you leaving,\u201d Ginny told Harry in an undertone, as they \nlaid the table for dinner on the third night of his stay. \n\n\u201cAnd then what does she think\u2019s going to happen?\u201d Harry muttered. \u201cSomeone \nelse might kill off Voldemort while she\u2019s holding us here making vol-au-vents?\u201d \n\nHe had spoken without thinking, and saw Ginny\u2019s face whiten. \n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s true?\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re trying to do?\u201d \n\n\u201cI \u2013 not \u2013 I was joking,\u201d said Harry evasively. \n\nThey stared at each other, and there was something more than shock in Ginny\u2019s \nexpression. Suddenly Harry became aware that this was the first time that he had been \nalone with her since those stolen hours in secluded corners of the Hogwarts grounds. He \nwas sure she was remembering them too. Both of them jumped as the door opened, and \nMr. Weasley, Kingsley, and Bill walked in. \n\nThey were often joined by other Order members for dinner now, because the \nBurrow had replaced number twelve, Grimmauld Place as the headquarters. Mr. Weasley \nhad explained that after the death of Dumbledore, their Secret-Keeper, each of the people \nto whom Dumbledore had confided Grimmauld Place\u2019s location had become a Secret-\nKeeper in turn. \n\n\u201cAnd as there are around twenty of us, that greatly dilutes the power of the \nFidelius Charm. Twenty times as many opportunities for the Death Eaters to get the \nsecret out of somebody. We can\u2019t expect it to hold much longer.\u201d \n\n\u201cBut surely Snape will have told the Death Eaters the address by now?\u201d asked \nHarry. \n\n\u201cWell, Mad-Eye set up a couple of curses against Snape in case he turns up there \nagain. We hope they\u2019ll be strong enough both to keep him out and to bind his tongue if he \ntries to talk about the place, but we can\u2019t be sure. It would have been insane to keep using \nthe place as headquarters now that its protection has become so shaky.\u201d \n\nThe kitchen was so crowded that evening it was difficult to maneuver knives and \nforks. Harry found himself crammed beside Ginny; the unsaid things that had just passed \nbetween them made him wish they had been separated by a few more people. He was \ntrying so hard to avoid brushing her arm he could barely cut his chicken. \n\n\u201cNo news about Mad-Eye?\u201d Harry asked Bill. \n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d replied Bill. \n\nThey had not been able to hold a funeral for Moody, because Bill and Lupin had \nfailed to recover his body. It had been difficult to know where he might have fallen, given \nthe darkness and the confusion of the battle. \n\n\u201cThe Daily Prophet hasn\u2019t said a word about him dying or about finding the \nbody,\u201d Bill went on. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean much. It\u2019s keeping a lot quiet these days.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd they still haven\u2019t called a hearing about all the underage magic I used \nescaping the Death Eaters?\u201d Harry called across the table to Mr. Weasley, who shook his \nhead. \n\n\u201cBecause they know I had no choice or because they don\u2019t want me to tell the \nworld Voldemort attacked me?\u201d \n\n\f\n\u201cThe latter, I think. Scrimgeour doesn\u2019t want to admit that You-Know-Who is as \npowerful as he is, nor that Azkaban\u2019s seen a mass breakout.\u201d \n\n\u201cYeah, why tell the public the truth?\u201d said Harry, clenching his knife so tightly \nthat the faint scars on the back of his right hand stood out, white against his skin: I must \nnot tell lies. \n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t anyone at the Ministry prepared to stand up to him?\u201d asked Ron angrily. \n\n\u201cOf course, Ron, but people are terrified,\u201d Mr. Weasley replied, \u201cterrified that \nthey will be next to disappear, their children the next to be attacked! There are nasty \nrumors going around; I for one don\u2019t believe the Muggle Studies professor at Hogwarts \nresigned. She hasn\u2019t been seen for weeks now. Meanwhile Scrimgeour remains shut up in \nhis office all day; I just hope he\u2019s working on a plan.\u201d \n\nThere was a pause in which Mrs. Weasley magicked the empty plates onto the \nwork surface and served apple tart. \n\n\u201cWe must decide \u2018ow you will be disguised, \u2018Arry,\u201d said Fleur, once everyone \nhad pudding. \u201cFor ze wedding,\u201d she added, when he looked confused. \u201cOf course, none \nof our guests are Death Eaters, but we cannot guarantee zat zey will not let something \nslip after zey \u2018ave \u2018ad champagne.\u201d \n\nFrom this, Harry gathered that she still suspected Hagrid. \n\n\u201cYes, good point,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley from the top of the table where she sat, \nspectacles perched on the end of her nose, scanning an immense list of jobs that she had \nscribbled on a very long piece of parchment. \u201cNow, Ron, have you cleaned out your \nroom yet?\u201d \n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d exclaimed Ron, slamming his spoon down and glaring at his mother. \n\u201cWhy does my room have to be cleaned out? Harry and I are fine with it the way it is!\u201d \n\n\u201cWe are holding your brother\u2019s wedding here in a few days\u2019 time, young man \u2013\u201c \n\n\u201cAnd are they getting married in my bedroom?\u201d asked Ron furiously. \u201cNo! So \nwhy in the name of Merlin\u2019s saggy left \u2013\u201c \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk to your mother like that,\u201d said Mr. Weasley firmly. \u201cAnd do as you\u2019re \ntold.\u201d \n\nRon scowled at both his parents, then picked up his spoon and attacked the last \nfew mouthfuls of his apple tart. \n\n\u201cI can help, some of it\u2019s my mess.\u201d Harry told Ron, but Mrs. Weasley cut across \nhim. \n\n\u201cNo, Harry, dear, I\u2019d much rather you helped Arthur much out the chickens, and \nHermione, I\u2019d be ever so grateful if you\u2019d change the sheets for Monsieur and Madame \nDelacour; you know they\u2019re arriving at eleven tomorrow morning.\u201d \n\nBut as it turned out, there was very little to do for the chickens. \u201cThere\u2019s no need \nto, er, mention it to Molly,\u201d Mr. Weasley told Harry, blocking his access to the coop, \u201cbut, \ner, Ted Tonks sent me most of what was left of Sirius\u2019s bike and, er, I\u2019m hiding \u2013 that\u2019s \nto say, keeping \u2013 it in here. Fantastic stuff: There\u2019s an exhaust gaskin, as I believe it\u2019s \ncalled, the most magnificent battery, and it\u2019ll be a great opportunity to find out how \nbrakes work. I\u2019m going to try and put it all back together again when Molly\u2019s not \u2013 I \nmean, when I\u2019ve got time.\u201d \n\nWhen they returned to the house, Mrs. Weasley was nowhere to be seen, so Harry \nslipped upstairs to Ron\u2019s attic bedroom. \n\n\f\n\u201cI\u2019m doing it, I\u2019m doing \u2013 ! Oh, it\u2019s you,\u201d said Ron in relief, as Harry entered the \nroom. Ron lay back down on the bed, which he had evidently just vacated. The room was \njust as messy as it had been all week; the only chance was that Hermione was now sitting \nin the far corner, her fluffy ginger cat, Crookshanks, at her feet, sorting books, some of \nwhich Harry recognized as his own, into two enormous piles. \n\n\u201cHi, Harry,\u201d she said, as he sat down on his camp bed. \n\n\u201cAnd how did you manage to get away?\u201d \n\n\u201cOh, Ron\u2019s mum forgot that she asked Ginny and me to change the sheets \nyesterday,\u201d said Hermione. She threw Numerology and Grammatica onto one pile and \nThe Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts onto the other. \n\n\u201cWe were just talking about Mad-Eye,\u201d Ron told Harry. \u201cI reckon he might have \nsurvived.\u201d \n\n\u201cBut Bill saw him hit by the Killing Curse,\u201d said Harry. \n\n\u201cYeah, but Bill was under attack too,\u201d said Ron. \u201cHow can he be sure what he \nsaw?\u201d \n\n\u201cEven if the Killing Curse missed, Mad-Eye still fell about a thousand feet,\u201d said \nHermione, now weight Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland in her hand. \n\n\u201cHe could have used a Shield Charm \u2013\u201c \n\n\u201cFleur said his wand was blasted out of his hand,\u201d said Harry. \n\n\u201cWell, all right, if you want him to be dead,\u201d said Ron grumpily, punching his \npillow into a more comfortable shape. \n\n\u201cOf course we don\u2019t want him to be dead!\u201d said Hermione, looking shocked. \u201cIt\u2019s \ndreadful that he\u2019s dead! But we\u2019re being realistic!\u201d \n\nFor the first time, Harry imagined Mad-Eye\u2019s body, broken as Dumbledore\u2019s had \nbeen, yet with that one eye still whizzing in its socket. He felt a stab of revulsion mixed \nwith a bizarre desire to laugh. \n\n\u201cThe Death Eaters probably tidied up after themselves, that\u2019s why no one\u2019s found \nhim,\u201d said Ron wisely. \n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry. \u201cLike Barty Crouch, turned into a bone and buried in \nHagrid\u2019s front garden. They probably transfigured Moody and stuffed him \u2013\u201c \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d squealed Hermione. Startled, Harry looked over just in time to see her \nburst into tears over her copy of Spellman\u2019s Syllabary. \n\n\u201cOh no,\u201d said Harry, struggling to get up from the old camp bed. \u201cHermione, I \nwasn\u2019t trying to upset \u2013\u201c \n\nBut with a great creaking of rusty bedsprings, Ron bounded off the bed and got \nthere first. One arm around Hermione, he fished in his jeans pocket and withdrew a \nrevolting-looking handkerchief that he had used to clean out the oven earlier. Hastily \npulling out his wand, he pointed it at the rag and said, \u201cTergeo.\u201d \n\nThe wand siphoned off most of the grease. Looking rather pleased with himself, \nRon handed the slightly smoking handkerchief to Hermione. \n\n\u201cOh . . . thanks, Ron. . . . I\u2019m sorry. . . .\u201d She blew her nose and hiccupped. \u201cIt\u2019s \njust so awf-ful, isn\u2019t it? R-right after Dumbledore . . . I j-just n-never imagined Mad-Eye \ndying, somehow, he seemed so tough!\u201d \n\n\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d said Ron, giving her a squeeze. \u201cBut you know what he\u2019d say to \nus if he was here?\u201d \n\n\u201c\u2019C-constant vigilance,\u2019\u201d said Hermione, mopping her eyes. \n\n\f\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said Ron, nodding. \u201cHe\u2019d tell us to learn from what happened to \nhim. And what I\u2019ve learned is not to trust that cowardly little squit, Mundungus.\u201d \n\nHermione gave a shaky laugh and leaned forward to pick up two more books. A \nsecond later, Ron had snatched his arm back from around her shoulders; she had dropped \nThe Monster of Monsters on his foot. The book had broken free from its restraining belt \nand snapped viciously at Ron\u2019s ankle. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d Hermione cried as Harry wrenched the book from Ron\u2019s \nleg and retied it shit. \n\n\u201cWhat are you doing with all those books anyway?\u201d Ron asked, limping back to \nhis bed. \n\n\u201cJust trying to decide which ones to take with us,\u201d said Hermione, \u201cWhen we\u2019re \nlooking for the Horcruxes.\u201d \n\n\u201cOh, of course,\u201d said Ron, clapping a hand to his forehead. \u201cI forgot we\u2019ll be \nhunting down Voldemort in a mobile library.\u201d \n\n\u201cHa ha,\u201d said Hermione, looking down at Spellman\u2019s Syllabary. \u201cI wonder . . . \nwill we need to translate runes? It\u2019s possible. . . . I think we\u2019d better take it, to be safe.\u201d \n\nShe dropped the syllabary onto the larger of the two piles and picked up Hogwarts, \nA History. \n\n\u201cListen,\u201d said Harry. \n\nHe had sat up straight. Ron and Hermione looked at him with similar mixtures of \nresignation and defiance. \n\n\u201cI know you said after Dumbledore\u2019s funeral that you wanted to come with me,\u201d \nHarry began. \n\n\u201cHere he goes,\u201d Ron said to Hermione, rolling his eyes. \n\n\u201cAs we knew he would,\u201d he sighed, turning back to the books. \u201cYou know, I \nthink I will take Hogwarts, A History. Even if we\u2019re not going back there, I don\u2019t think \nI\u2019d feel right if I didn\u2019t have it with \u2013\u201c \n\n\u201cListen!\u201d said Harry again. \n\n\u201cNo, Harry, you listen,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cWe\u2019re coming with you. That was \ndecided months ago \u2013 years, really.\u201d \n\n\u201cBut \u2013\u201c \n\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Ron advised him. \n\n\u201c\u2013 are you sure you\u2019ve thought this through?\u201d Harry persisted. \n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d said Hermione, slamming Travels with Trolls onto the discarded pile \nwith a rather fierce look. \u201cI\u2019ve been packing for days, so we\u2019re ready to leave at a \nmoment\u2019s notice, which for your information has included doing some pretty difficult \nmagic, not to mention smuggling Mad-Eye\u2019s whole stock of Polyjuice Potion right under \nRon\u2019s mum\u2019s nose. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve also modified my parents\u2019 memories so that they\u2019re convinced they\u2019re really \ncalled Wendell and Monica Wilkins, and that their life\u2019s ambition is to move to Australia, \nwhich they have now done. That\u2019s to make it more difficult for Voldemort to track them \ndown and interrogate them about me \u2013 or you, because unfortunately, I\u2019ve told them quite \na bit about you. \n\n\u201cAssuming I survive our hunt for the Horcruxes, I\u2019ll find Mum and Dad and lift \nthe enchantment. If I don\u2019t \u2013 well, I think I\u2019ve cast a good enough charm to keep them \n\n\f\nsafe and happy. Wendell and Monica Wilkins don\u2019t know that they\u2019ve got a daughter, \nyou see.\u201d \n\nHermione\u2019s eyes were swimming with tears again. Ron got back off the bed, put \nhis arm around her once more, and frowned at Harry as though reproaching him for lack \nof tact. Harry could not think of anything to say, not least because it was highly unusual \nfor Ron to be teaching anyone else tact. \n\n\u201cI \u2013 Hermione, I\u2019m sorry \u2013 I didn\u2019t \u2013\u201c \n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t realize that Ron and I know perfectly well what might happen if we come \nwith you? Well, we do. Ron, show Harry what you\u2019ve done.\u201d \n\n\u201cNah, he\u2019s just eaten,\u201d said Ron. \n\n\u201cGo on, he needs to know!\u201d \n\n\u201cOh, all right. Harry, come here.\u201d \n\nFor the second time Ron withdrew his arm from around Hermione and stumped \nover to the door. \n\n\u201cC\u2019mon.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Harry asked, following Ron out of the room onto the tiny landing. \n\n\u201cDescendo,\u201d muttered Ron, pointing his wand at the low ceiling. A hatch opened \nright over their heads and a ladder slid down to their feet. A horrible, half-sucking, half-\nmoaning sound came out of the square hole, along with an unpleasant smell like open \ndrains. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s your ghoul, isn\u2019t it?\u201d asked Harry, who had never actually met the \ncreature that sometimes disrupted the nightly silence. \n\n\u201cYeah, it is,\u201d said Ron, climbing the ladder. \u201cCome and have a look at him.\u201d \n\nHarry followed Ron up the few short steps into the tiny attic space. His head and \nshoulders were in the room before he caught sight of the creature curled up a few feet \nfrom him, fast asleep in the gloom with its large mouth wide open. \n\n\u201cBut it . . . it looks . . . do ghouls normally wear pajamas?\u201d \n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Ron. \u201cNor have they usually got red hair or that number of pustules.\u201d \n\nHarry contemplated the thing, slightly revolted. It was human in shape and size, \nand was wearing what, now that Harry\u2019s eyes became used to the darkness, was clearly \nan old pair of Ron\u2019s pajamas. He was also sure that ghouls were generally rather slimy \nand bald, rather than distinctly hairy and covered in angry purple blisters. \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s me, see?\u201d said Ron. \n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll explain it back in my room, the smell\u2019s getting to me,\u201d said Ron. They \nclimbed back down the ladder, which Ron returned to the ceiling, and rejoined Hermione, \nwho was still sorting books. \n\n\u201cOnce we\u2019ve left, the ghoul\u2019s going to come and live down here in my room,\u201d \nsaid Ron. \u201cI think he\u2019s really looking forward to it \u2013 well, it\u2019s hard to tell, because all he \ncan do is moan and drool \u2013 but he nods a lot when you mention it. Anyway, he\u2019s going to \nbe me with spattergroit. Good, eh?\u201d \n\nHarry merely looked his confusion. \n\n\u201cIt is!\u201d said Ron, clearly frustrated that Harry had not grasped the brilliance of the \nplan. \u201cLook, when we three don\u2019t turn up at Hogwarts again, everyone\u2019s going to think \nHermione and I must be with you, right? Which means the Death Eaters will go straight \nfor our families to see if they\u2019ve got information on where you are.\u201d \n\n\f\n\u201cBut hopefully it\u2019ll look like I\u2019ve gone away with Mum and Dad; a lot of Muggle-\nborns are talking about going into hiding at the moment,\u201d said Hermione. \n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t hide my whole family, it\u2019ll look too fishy and they can\u2019t all leave their \njobs,\u201d said Ron. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to put out the story that I\u2019m seriously ill with \nspattergroit, which is why I can\u2019t go back to school. If anyone comes calling to \ninvestigate, Mum or Dad can show them the ghoul in my bed, covered in pustules. \nSpattergroit\u2019s really contagious, so they\u2019re not going to want to go near him. It won\u2019t \nmatter that he can\u2019t say anything, either, because apparently you can\u2019t once the fungus \nhas spread to your uvula.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd your mum and dad are in on this plan?\u201d asked Harry. \n\n\u201cDad is. He helped Fred and George transform the ghoul. Mum . . . well, you\u2019ve \nseen what she\u2019s like. She won\u2019t accept we\u2019re going till we\u2019re gone.\u201d \n\nThere was silence in the room, broken only by gentle thuds as Hermione \ncontinued to throw books onto one pile or the other. Ron sat watching her, and Harry \nlooked from one to the other, unable to say anything. The measure they had taken to \nprotect their families made him realize, more than anything else could have done, that \nthey really were going to come with him and that they knew exactly how dangerous that \nwould be. He wanted to tell them what that meant to him, but he simply could not find \nwords important enough. \n\nThrough the silence came the muffled sounds of Mrs. Weasley shouting from four \nfloors below. \n\n\u201cGinny\u2019s probably left a speck of dust on a poxy napkin ring,\u201d said Ron. \u201cI dunno \nwhy the Delacours have got to come two days before the wedding.\u201d \n\n\u201cFleur\u2019s sister\u2019s a bridesmaid, she needs to be here for the rehearsal, and she\u2019s too \nyoung to come on her own,\u201d said Hermione, as she pored indecisively over Break with a \nBanshee. \n\n\u201cWell, guests aren\u2019t going to help Mum\u2019s stress levels,\u201d said Ron. \n\n\u201cWhat we really need to decide,\u201d said Hermione, tossing Defensive Magical \nTheory into the bin without a second glance and picking up An Appraisal of Magical \nEducation in Europe, \u201cis where we\u2019re going after we leave here. I know you said you \nwanted to go to Godric\u2019s Hollow first, Harry, and I understand why, but . . . well . . . \nshouldn\u2019t we make the Horcruxes our priority?\u201d \n\n\u201cIf we knew where any of the Horcruxes were, I\u2019d agree with you,\u201d said Harry, \nwho did not believe that Hermione really understood his desire to return to Godric\u2019s \nHollow. His parents\u2019 graves were only part of the attraction: He had a strong, though \ninexplicable, feeling that the place held answers for him. Perhaps it was simply because it \nwas there that he had survived Voldemort\u2019s Killing Curse; now that he was facing the \nchallenge of repeating the feat, Harry was drawn to the place where it had happened, \nwanting to understand. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think there\u2019s a possibility that Voldemort\u2019s keeping a watch on \nGodric\u2019s Hollow?\u201d Hermione asked. \u201cHe might expect you to go back and visit your \nparents\u2019 graves once you\u2019re free to go wherever you like?\u201d \n\nThis had not occurred to Harry. While he struggled to find a counterargument, \nRon spoke up, evidently following his own train of thought. \n\n\u201cThis R.A.B. person,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, the one who stole the real locket?\u201d \n\nHermione nodded. \n\n\f\n\u201cHe said in his note he was going to destroy it, didn\u2019t he?\u201d \n\nHarry dragged his rucksack toward him and pulled out the fake Horcrux in which \nR.A.B.\u2019s note was still folded. \n\n\u201c\u2019I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can.\u2019\u201d Harry \nread out. \n\n\u201cWell, what if he did finish it off?\u201d said Ron. \n\n\u201cOr she.\u201d Interposed Hermione. \n\n\u201cWhichever,\u201d said Ron. \u201cit\u2019d be one less for us to do!\u201d \n\n\u201cYes, but we\u2019re still going to have to try and trace the real locket, aren\u2019t we?\u201d said \nHermione, \u201cto find out whether or not it\u2019s destroyed.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd once we get hold of it, how do you destroy a Horcrux?\u201d asked Ron. \n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Hermione, \u201cI\u2019ve been researching that.\u201d \n\n\u201cHow?\u201d asked Harry. \u201cI didn\u2019t think there were any books on Horcruxes in the \nlibrary?\u201d \n\n\u201cThere weren\u2019t,\u201d said Hermione, who had turned pink. \u201cDumbledore removed \nthem all, but he \u2013 he didn\u2019t destroy them.\u201d \nRon sat up straight, wide-eyed. \n\n\u201cHow in the name of Merlin\u2019s pants have you managed to get your hands on those \nHorcrux books?\u201d \n\n\u201cIt \u2013 it wasn\u2019t stealing!\u201d said Hermione, looking from Harry to Ron with a kind of \ndesperation. \u201cThey were still library books, even if Dumbledore had taken them off the \nshelves. Anyway, if he really didn\u2019t want anyone to get at them, I\u2019m sure he would have \nmade it much harder to \u2013\u201c \n\n\u201cGet to the point!\u201d said Ron. \n\n\u201cWell . . . it was easy,\u201d said Hermione in a small voice. \u201cI just did a Summoning \nCharm. You know \u2013 Accio. And \u2013 they zoomed out of Dumbledore\u2019s study window right \ninto the girls\u2019 dormitory.\u201d \n\n\u201cBut when did you do this?\u201d Harry asked, regarding Hermione with a mixture of \nadmiration and incredulity. \n\n\u201cJust after his \u2013 Dumbledore\u2019s \u2013 funeral,\u201d said Hermione in an even smaller voice. \n\u201cRight after we agreed we\u2019d leave school and go and look for the Horcruxes. When I \nwent back upstairs to get my things it \u2013 it just occurred to me that the more we knew \nabout them, the better it would be . . . and I was alone in there . . . so I tried . . . and it \nworked. They flew straight in through the open window and I \u2013 I packed them.\u201d \n\nShe swallowed and then said imploringly, \u201cI can\u2019t believe Dumbledore would \nhave been angry, it\u2019s not as though we\u2019re going to use the information to make a Horcrux, \nis it?\u201d \n\n\u201cCan you hear us complaining?\u201d said Ron. \u201cWhere are these books anyway?\u201d \n\nHermione rummaged for a moment and then extracted from the pile a large \nvolume, bound in faded black leather. She looked a little nauseated and held it as gingerly \nas if it were something recently dead. \n\n\u201cThis is the one that gives explicit instructions on how to make a Horcrux. Secrets \nof the Darkest Art \u2013 it\u2019s a horrible book, really awful, full of evil magic. I wonder when \nDumbledore removed it from the library. . . . if he didn\u2019t do it until he was headmaster, I \nbet Voldemort got all the instruction he needed from here.\u201d \n\n\f\n\u201cWhy did he have to ask Slughorn how to make a Horcrux, then, if he\u2019d already \nread that?\u201d asked Ron. \n\n\u201cHe only approached Slughorn to find out what would happen if you split your \nsoul into seven,\u201d said Harry. \u201cDumbledore was sure Riddle already knew how to make a \nHorcrux by the time he asked Slughorn about them. I think you\u2019re right, Hermione, that \ncould easily have been where he got the information.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd the more I\u2019ve read about them,\u201d said Hermione, \u201cthe more horrible they \nseem, and the less I can believe that he actually made six. It warns in this book how \nunstable you make the rest of your soul by ripping it, and that\u2019s just by making one \nHorcrux!\u201d \n\nHarry remembered what Dumbledore had said about Voldemort moving beyond \n\u201cusual evil.\u201d \n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t there any way of putting yourself back together?\u201d Ron asked. \n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Hermione with a hollow smile, \u201cbut it would be excruciatingly \npainful.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhy? How do you do it?\u201d asked Harry. \n\n\u201cRemorse,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to really feel what you\u2019ve done. There\u2019s \na footnote. Apparently the pain of it can destroy you. I can\u2019t see Voldemort attempting it \nsomehow, can you?\u201d \n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Ron, before Harry could answer. \u201cSo does it say how to destroy \nHorcruxes in that book?\u201d \n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Hermione, now turning the fragile pages as if examining rotting \nentrails, \u201cbecause it warns Dark wizards how strong they have to make the enchantments \non them. From all that I\u2019ve read, what Harry did to Riddle\u2019s diary was one of the few \nreally foolproof ways of destroying a Horcrux.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat, stabbing it with a basilisk fang?\u201d asked Harry. \n\n\u201cOh well, lucky we\u2019ve got such a large supply of basilisk fangs, then,\u201d said Ron. \n\u201cI was wondering what we were going to do with them.\u201d \n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be a basilisk fang,\u201d said Hermione patiently. \u201cIt has to be \nsomething so destructive that the Horcrux can\u2019t repair itself. Basilisk venom only has one \nantidote, and it\u2019s incredibly rare \u2013\u201c \n\n\u201c\u2013 phoenix tears,\u201d said Harry, nodding. \n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cOur problem is that there are very few substances as \ndestructive as basilisk venom, and they\u2019re all dangerous to carry around with you. That\u2019s \na problem we\u2019re going to have to solve, though, because ripping, smashing, or crushing a \nHorcrux won\u2019t do the trick. You\u2019ve got to put it beyond magical repair.\u201d \n\n\u201cBut even if we wreck the thing it lives in,\u201d said Ron, \u201cwhy can\u2019t the bit of soul in \nit just go and live in something else?\u201d \n\n\u201cBecause a Horcrux is the complete opposite of a human being.\u201d \n\nSeeing that Harry and Ron looked thoroughly confused, Hermione hurried on. \n\u201cLook, if I picked up a sword right now, Ron, and ran you through with it, I wouldn\u2019t \ndamage your soul at all.\u201d \n\n\u201dWhich would be a real comfort to me, I\u2019m sure,\u201d said Ron. Harry laughed. \n\n\u201cIt should be, actually! But my point is that whatever happens to your body, your \nsoul will survive, untouched,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cBut it\u2019s the other way round with a \n\n\f\nHorcrux. The fragment of soul inside it depends on its container, its enchanted body, for \nsurvival. It can\u2019t exist without it.\u201d \n\n\u201cThat diary sort of died when I stabbed it,\u201d said Harry, remembering ink pouring \nlike blood from the punctured pages, and the screams of the piece of Voldemort\u2019s soul as \nit vanished. \n\n\u201cAnd once the diary was properly destroyed, the bit of soul trapped in it could no \nlonger exist. Ginny tried to get rid of the diary before you did, flushing it away, but \nobviously it came back good as new.\u201d \n\n\u201cHang on,\u201d said Ron, frowning. \u201cThe bit of soul in that diary was possessing \nGinny, wasn\u2019t it? How does that work, then?\u201d \n\n\u201cWhile the magical container is still intact, the bit of soul inside it can flit in and \nout of someone if they get too close to the object. I don\u2019t mean holding it for too long, it\u2019s \nnothing to do with touching it,\u201d she added before Ron could speak. \u201cI mean close \nemotionally. Ginny poured her heart out into that diary, she made herself incredibly \nvulnerable. You\u2019re in trouble if you get too fond of or dependent on the Horcrux.\u201d \n\n\u201cI wonder how Dumbledore destroyed the ring?\u201d said Harry. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I ask \nhim? I never really . . .\u201d \n\nHis voice trailed away: He was thinking of all the things he should have asked \nDumbledore, and of how, since the headmaster had died, it seemed to Harry that he had \nwasted so many opportunities when Dumbledore had been alive, to find out more . . . to \nfind out everything. . . . \n\nThe silence was shattered as the bedroom door flew open with a wall-shaking \ncrash. Hermione shrieked and dropped Secrets of the Darkest Art; Crookshanks streaked \nunder the bed, hissing indignantly; Ron jumped off the bed, skidded on a discarded \nChocolate Frog wrapper, and smacked his head on the opposite wall; and Harry \ninstinctively dived for his wand before realizing that he was looking up at Mrs. Weasley, \nwhose hair was disheveled and whose face was contorted with rage. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry to break up this cozy little gathering,\u201d she said, her voice trembling. \n\u201cI\u2019m sure you all need your rest . . . but there are wedding presents stacked in my room \nthat need sorting out and I was under the impression that you had agreed to help.\u201d \n\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d said Hermione, looking terrified as she leapt to her feet, sending books \nflying in every direction. \u201cwe will . . . we\u2019re sorry . . .\u201d \n\nWith an anguished look at Harry and Ron, Hermione hurried out of the room after \nMrs. Weasley. \n\n\u201cit\u2019s like being a house-elf,\u201d complained Ron in an undertone, still massaging his \nhead as he and Harry followed. \u201cExcept without the job satisfaction. The sooner this \nwedding\u2019s over, the happier, I\u2019ll be.\u201d \n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry, \u201cthen we\u2019ll have nothing to do except find Horcruxes. . . . \nIt\u2019ll be like a holiday, won\u2019t it?\u201d \n\nRon started to laugh, but at the sight of the enormous pile of wedding presents \nwaiting for them in Mrs. Weasley\u2019s room, stopped quite abruptly. \n\nThe Delacours arrived the following morning at eleven o\u2019 clock. Harry, Ron, \nHermione and Ginny were feeling quite resentful toward Fleur\u2019s family by this time; and \nit was with ill grace that Ron stumped back upstairs to put on matching socks, and Harry \nattempted to flatten his hair. Once they had all been deemed smart enough, they trooped \nout into the sunny backyard to await the visitors. \n\n\f\nHarry had never seen the place looking so tidy. The rusty cauldrons and old \nWellington boots that usually littered the steps by the back door were gone, replaced by \ntwo new Flutterby bushes standing either side of the door in large pots; though there was \nno breeze, the leaves waved lazily, giving an attractive rippling effect. The chickens had \nbeen shut away, the yard had been swept, and the nearby garden had been pruned, \nplucked, and generally spruced up, although Harry, who liked it in its overgrown state, \nthought that it looked rather forlorn without its usual contingent of capering gnomes. \n\nHe had lost track of how many security enchantments had been placed upon the \nBurrow by both the Order and the Ministry; all he knew was that it was no longer \npossible for anybody to travel by magic directly into the place. Mr. Weasley had \ntherefore gone to meet the Delacours on top of a nearby hill, where they were to arrive by \nPortkey. The first sound of their approach was an unusually high-pitched laugh, which \nturned out to be coming from Mr. Weasley, who appeared at the gate moments later, \nladen with luggage and leading a beautiful blonde woman in long, leaf green robes, who \ncould be Fleur\u2019s mother. \n\n\u201cMaman!\u201d cried Fleur, rushing forward to embrace her. \u201cPapa!\u201d \n\nMonsieur Delacour was nowhere near as attractive as his wife; he was a head \nshorter and extremely plumb, with a little, pointed black beard. However, he looked \ngood-natured. Bouncing towards Mrs. Weasley on high-heeled boots, he kissed her twice \non each cheek, leaving her flustered. \n\n\u201cYou \u2018ave been so much trouble,\u201d he said in a deep voice. \u201cFleur tells us you \u2018ave \nbeen working very \u2018ard.\u201d \n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s been nothing, nothing!\u201d trilled Mrs. Weasley. \u201cNo trouble at all!\u201d \n\nRon relieved his feelings by aiming a kick at a gnome who was peering out from \nbehind one of the new Flutterby bushes. \n\n\u201cDear lady!\u201d said Monsieur Delacour, still holding Mrs. Weasley\u2019s hand between \nhis own two plump ones and beaming. \u201cWe are most honored at the approaching union of \nour two families! Let me present my wife, Apolline.\u201d \n\nMadame Delacour glided forward and stooped to kiss Mrs. Weasley too. \n\n\u201cEnchant\u00e9e,\u201d she said. \u201cYour \u2018usband \u2018as been telling us such amusing stories!\u201d \n\nMr. Weasley gave a maniacal laugh; Mrs. Weasley threw him a look, upon which \nhe became immediately silent and assumed an expression appropriate to the sickbed of a \nclose friend. \n\n\u201cAnd, of course, you \u2018ave met my leetle daughter, Gabrielle!\u201d said Monsieur \nDelacour. Gabrielle was Fleur in miniature; eleven years old, with waist-length hair of \npure, silvery blonde, she gave Mrs. Weasley a dazzling smile and hugged her, then threw \nHarry a glowing look, batting her eyelashes. Ginny cleared her throat loudly. \n\n\u201cWell, come in, do!\u201d said Mrs. Weasley brightly, and she ushered the Delacours \ninto the house, with many \u201cNo, please!\u201ds and \u201cAfter you!\u201ds and \u201cNot at all!\u201ds. \n\nThe Delacours, it soon transpired, were helpful, pleasant guests. They were \npleased with everything and keen to assist with the preparations for the wedding. \nMonsieur Delacour pronounced everything from the seating plan to the bridesmaids\u2019 \nshoes \u201cCharmant!\u201d Madame Delacour was most accomplished at household spells and \nhad the oven properly cleaned in a trice; Gabrielle followed her elder sister around, trying \nto assist in any way she could and jabbering away in rapid French. \n\n\f\nOn the downside, the Burrow was not built to accommodate so many people. Mr. \nand Mrs. Weasley were now sleeping in the sitting room, having shouted down Monsieur \nand Madame Delacour\u2019s protests and insisted they take their bedroom. Gabrielle was \nsleeping with Fleur in Percy\u2019s old room, and Bill would be sharing with Charlie, his best \nman, once Charlie arrived from Romania. Opportunities to make plans together became \nvirtually nonexistent, and it was in desperation that Harry, Ron and Hermione took to \nvolunteering to feed the chickens just to escape the overcrowded house. \n\n\u201cBut she still won\u2019t leave us alone!\u201d snarled Ron, and their second attempt at a \nmeeting in the yard was foiled by the appearance of Mrs. Weasley carrying a large basket \nof laundry in her arms. \n\n\u201cOh, good, you\u2019ve fed the chickens,\u201d she called as she approached them. \u201cWe\u2019d \nbetter shut them away again before the men arrive tomorrow . . . to put up the tent for the \nwedding,\u201d she explained, pausing to lean against the henhouse. She looked exhausted. \n\u201cMillamant\u2019s Magic Marquees . . . they\u2019re very good. Bill\u2019s escorting them. . . . You\u2019d \nbetter stay inside while they\u2019re here, Harry. I must say it does complicate organizing a \nwedding, having all these security spells around the place.\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d said Harry humbly. \n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t be silly, dear!\u201d said Mrs. Weasley at once. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean \u2013 well, your \nsafety\u2019s much more important! Actually, I\u2019ve been wanting to ask you how you want to \ncelebrate your birthday, Harry. Seventeen, after all, it\u2019s an important day. . . .\u201d \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want a fuss,\u201d said Harry quickly, envisaging the additional strain this \nwould put on them all. \u201cReally, Mrs. Weasley, just a normal dinner would be fine. . . . It\u2019s \nthe day before the wedding. . . .\u201d \n\n\u201cOh, well, if you\u2019re sure, dear. I\u2019ll invite Remus and Tonks, shall I? And how \nabout Hagrid?\u201d \n\n\u201cThat\u2019d be great,\u201d said Harry. \u201cBut please, don\u2019t go to loads of trouble.\u201d \n\n\u201cNot at all, not at all . . . It\u2019s no trouble. . . .\u201d \n\nShe looked at him, a long, searching look, then smiled a little sadly, straightened \nup, and walked away. Harry watched as she waved her wand near the washing line, and \nthe damp clothes rose into the air to hang themselves up, and suddenly he felt a great \nwave of remorse for the inconvenience and the pain he was giving her. \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter Seven \n\n The Will of Albus Dumbledore \n\n \n\nHe was walking along a mountain road in the cool blue light of dawn. Far below, \nswathed in mist, was the shadow of a small town. Was the man he sought down there, the \nman he needed so badly he could think of little else, the man who held the answer, the \nanswer to his problem...? \n\n\"Oi, wake up.\" \n\nHarry opened his eyes. He was lying again on the camp bed in Ron's dingy attic \nroom. The sun had not yet risen and the room was still shadowy. Pigwidgeon was asleep \nwith his head under his tiny wing. The scar on Harry's forehead was prickling. \n\n\f\n\"You were muttering in your sleep.\" \n\n\"Was I?\" \n\n\"Yeah. 'Gregorovitch.' You kept saying 'Gregorovitch.'\" \n\nHarry was not wearing his glasses; Ron's face appeared slightly blurred. \n\n\"Who's Gregorovitch?\" \n\n \n\n\"I dunno, do I?\" You were the one saying it.\" \n\nHarry rubbed his forehead, thinking. He had a vague idea he had heard the name \nbefore, but he could not think where. \n\n\"I think Voldemort's looking for him.\" \n\n\"Poor bloke,\" said Ron fervently. \n\nHarry sat up, still rubbing his scar, now wide awake. He tried to remember \nexactly what he had seen in the dream, but all that came back was a mountainous horizon \nand the outline of the little village cradled in a deep valley. \n\n\"I think he's abroad.\" \n\n\"Who, Gregorovitch?\" \n\n\"Voldemort. I think he's somewhere abroad, looking for Gregorovitch. It didn't \nlook like anywhere in Britain.\" \n\n\"You reckon you were seeing into his mind again?\" \n\nRon sounded worried. \n\n\"Do me a favor and don't tell Hermione,\" said Harry. \"Although how she expects \nme to stop seeing stuff in my sleep...\" \n\nHe gazed up at little Pigwidgeon's cage, thinking...Why was the name \n\"Gregorovitch\" familiar? \n\n\"I think,\" he said slowly, \"he's got something to do with Quidditch. There's some \nconnection, but I can't--I can't think what it is.\" \n\n\"Quidditch?\" said Ron. \"Sure you're not thinking of Gorgovitch?\" \n\n\"Who?\" \n\n\"Dragomir Gorgovitch, Chaser, transferred to the Chudley Cannons for a record \nfee two years ago. Record holder for most Quaffle drops in a season.\" \n\n\"No,\" said Harry. \"I'm definitely not thinking of Gorgovitch.\" \n\n \n\n\"I try not to either,\" said Ron. \"Well, happy birthday anyway.\" \n\n\"Wow -- that's right, I forgot! I'm seventeen!\" \n\nHarry seized the wand lying beside his camp bed, pointed it at the cluttered desk \nwhere he had left his glasses, and said, \"Accio Glasses!\" Although they were only around \na foot away, there was something immensely satisfying about seeing them zoom toward \nhim, at least until they poked him in the eye. \n\n\"Slick,\" snorted Ron. \n\nReveling in the removal of his Trace, Harry sent Ron's possessions flying around \nthe room, causing Pigwidgeon to wake up and flutter excitedly around his cage. Harry \nalso tried tying the laces of his trainers by magic (the resultant knot took several minutes \nto untie by hand) and, purely for the pleasure of it, turned the orange robes on Ron's \nChudley Cannons posters bright blue. \n\n\f\n\"I'd do your fly by hand, though,\" Ron advised Harry, sniggering when Harry \nimmediately checked it. \"Here's your present. Unwrap it up here, it's not for my mother's \neyes.\" \n\n\"A book?\" said Harry as he took the rectangular parcel. \"Bit of a departure from \ntradition, isn't it?\" \n\n\"This isn't your average book,\" said Ron. \"It'd pure gold: Twelve Fail-Safe Ways \nto Charm Witches. Explains everything you need to know about girls. If only I'd had this \nlast year I'd have known exactly how to get rid of Lavender and I would've known how to \nget going with... Well, Fred and George gave me a copy, and I've learned a lot. You'd be \nsurprised, it's not all about wandwork, either.\" \n\nWhen they arrived in the kitchen they found a pile of presents waiting on the table. \nBill and Monsieur Delacour were finishing their breakfasts, while Mrs. Weasley stood \nchatting to them over the frying pan. \n\n \n\n\"Arthur told me to wish you a happy seventeenth, Harry,\" said Mrs. Weasley, \nbeaming at him. \"He had to leave early for work, but he'll be back for dinner. That's our \npresent on top.\" \n\nHarry sat down, took the square parcel she had indicated, and unwrapped it. \nInside was a watch very like the one Mr. and Mrs. Weasley had given Ron for his \nseventeenth; it was gold, with stars circling around the race instead of hands. \n\n\"It's traditional to give a wizard a watch when he comes of age,\" said Mrs. \nWeasley, watching him anxiously from beside the cooker. \"I'm afraid that one isn't new \nlike Ron's, it was actually my brother Fabian's and he wasn't terribly careful with his \npossessions, it's a bit dented on the back, but--\" \n\nThe rest of her speech was lost; Harry had got up and hugged her. He tried to put \na lot of unsaid things into the hug and perhaps she understood them, because she patted \nhis cheek clumsily when he released her, then waved her wand in a slightly random way, \ncausing half a pack of bacon to flop out of the frying pan onto the floor. \n\n\"Happy birthday, Harry!\" said Hermione, hurrying into the kitchen and adding her \nown present to the top of the pile. \"It's not much, but I hope you like it. What did you get \nhim?\" she added to Ron, who seemed not to hear her. \n\n\"Come on, then, open Hermione's!\" said Ron. \n\nShe had bought him a new Sneakoscope. The other packages contained an \nenchanted razor from Bill and Fleur (\"Ah yes, zis will give you ze smoothest shave you \nwill ever 'ave,\" Monsieur Delacour assured him, \"but you must tell it clearly what you \nwant...ozzerwise you might find you 'ave a leetle less hair zan you would like...\"), \nchocolates from the Delacours, and an enormous box of the latest Weasleys' Wizard \nWheezes merchandise from Fred and George. \n\n \n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione did not linger at the table, as the arrival of Madame \nDelacour, Fleur, and Gabrielle made the kitchen uncomfortably crowded. \n\n\"I'll pack these for you,\" Hermione said brightly, taking Harry's presents out of his \narms as the three of them headed back upstairs. \"I'm nearly done, I'm just waiting for the \nrest of your underpants to come out of the wash, Ron--\" \n\nRon's splutter was interrupted by the opening of a door on the first-floor landing. \n\n\"Harry, will you come in here a moment?\" \n\n\f\nIt was Ginny. Ron came to an abrupt halt, but Hermione took him by the elbow \nand tugged him on up the stairs. Feeling nervous, Harry followed Ginny into her room. \n\nHe had never been inside it before. It was small, but bright. There was a large \nposter of the Wizarding band the Weird Sisters on one wall, and a picture of Gwenog \nJones, Captain of the all-witch Quidditch team the Holyhead Harpies, on the other. A \ndesk stood facing the open window, which looked out over the orchard where he and \nGinny had once played a two-a-side Quidditch with Ron and Hermione, and which now \nhoused a large, pearly white marquee. The golden flag on top was level with Ginny's \nwindow. \n\nGinny looked up into Harry's face, took a deep breath, and said, \"Happy \nseventeenth.\" \n\n\"Yeah...thanks.\" \n\nShe was looking at him steadily; he however, found it difficult to look back at her; \nit was like gazing into a brilliant light. \n\n\"Nice view,\" he said feebly, pointing toward with window. \n\nShe ignored this. He could not blame her. \n\n\"I couldn't think what to get you,\" she said. \n\n \n\n\"You didn't have to get me anything.\" \n\nShe disregarded this too. \n\n\"I didn't know what would be useful. Nothing too big, because you wouldn't be \nable to take it with you.\" \n\nHe chanced a glance at her. She was not tearful; that was one of the many \nwonderful things about Ginny, she was rarely weepy. He had sometimes thought that \nhaving six brothers must have toughened her up. \n\nShe took a step closer to him. \n\n\"So then I thought, I'd like you to have something to remember me by, you know, \nif you meet some veela when you're off doing whatever you're doing.\" \n\n\"I think dating opportunities are going to be pretty thin on the ground, to be \nhonest.\" \n\n\"There's the silver lining I've been looking for,\" she whispered, and then she was \nkissing him as she had never kissed him before, and Harry was kissing her back, and it \nwas blissful oblivion better than firewhisky; she was the only real thing in the world, \nGinny, the feel of her, one hand at her back and one in her long, sweet-smelling hair-- \n\nThe door banged open behind them and they jumped apart. \n\n\"Oh,\" said Ron pointedly. \"Sorry.\" \n\n\"Ron!\" Hermione was just behind him, slight out of breath. There was a strained \nsilence, then Ginny had said in a flat little voice, \n\n\"Well, happy birthday anyway, Harry.\" \n\nRon's ears were scarlet; Hermione looked nervous. Harry wanted to slam the door \nin their faces, but it felt as though a cold draft had entered the room when the door \nopened, and his shining moment had popped like a soap bubble. All the reasons for \nending his relationship with Ginny, for staying well away from her, seemed to have slunk \ninside the room with Ron, and all happy forgetfulness was gone. \n\n\f\nHe looked at Ginny, wanting to say something, though he hardly knew what, but \nshe had turned her back on him. He thought that she might have succumbed, for once, to \ntears. He could not do anything to comfort her in front of Ron. \n\n\"I'll see you later,\" he said, and followed the other two out of the bedroom. \n\nRon marched downstairs, though the still-crowded kitchen and into the yard, and \nHarry kept pace with him all the way, Hermione trotting along behind them looking \nscared. \n\nOnce he reached the seclusion of the freshly mown lawn, Ron rounded on Harry. \n\n\"You ditched her. What are you doing now, messing her around?\" \n\n\"I'm not messing her around,\" said Harry, as Hermione caught up with them. \n\n\"Ron--\" \n\nBut Ron held up a hand to silence her. \n\n\"She was really cut up when you ended it--\" \n\n\"So was I. You know why I stopped it, and it wasn't because I wanted to.\" \n\n\"Yeah, but you go snogging her now and she's just going to get her hopes up \nagain--\" \n\n\"She's not an idiot, she knows it can't happen, she's not expecting us to--to end up \nmarried, or--\" \n\nAs he said it, a vivid picture formed in Harry's mind of Ginny in a white dress, \nmarrying a tall, faceless, and unpleasant stranger. \n\n \n\nIn one spiraling moment it seemed to hit him: Her future was free and \nunencumbered, whereas his...he could see nothing but Voldemort ahead. \n\n\"If you keep groping her every chance you get--\" \n\n\"It won't happen again,\" said Harry harshly. The day was cloudless, but he felt as \nthough the sun had gone in. \"Okay?\" \n\nRon looked half resentful, half sheepish; he rocked backward and forward on his \nfeet for a moment, then said, \"Right then, well, that's...yeah.\" \n\nGinny did not seek another one-to-one meeting with Harry for the rest of the day, \nnor by any look or gesture did she show that they had shared more than polite \nconversation in her room. Nevertheless, Charlie's arrival came as a relief to Harry. It \nprovided a distraction, watching Mrs. Weasley force Charlie into a chair, raise her wand \nthreateningly, and announce that he was about to get a proper haircut. \n\nAs Harry's birthday dinner would have stretched the Burrow's kitchen to breaking \npoint even before the arrival of Charlie, Lupin, Tonks, and Hagrid, several tables were \nplaced end to end in the garden. Fred and George bewitched a number of purple lanterns \nall emblazoned with a large number 17, to hang in midair over the guests. Thanks to Mrs. \nWeasley's ministrations, George's wound was neat and clean, but Harry was not yet used \nto the dark hole in the side of his head, despite the twins' many jokes about it. \n\nHermione made purple and gold streamers erupt from the end of her wand and \ndrape themselves artistically over the trees and bushes. \n\n\"Nice,\" said Ron, as with one final flourish of her wand, Hermione \n\n \n\nturned the leaves on the crabapple tree to gold. \"You've really got an eye for that sort of \nthing.\" \n\n\f\n\"Thank you, Ron!\" said Hermione, looking both pleased and a little confused. \nHarry turned away, smiling to himself. He had a funny notion that he would find a \nchapter on compliments when he found time to peruse his copy of Twelve Fail-Safe \nWays to Charm Witches; he caught Ginny's eye and grinned at her before remembering \nhis promise to Ron and hurriedly striking up a conversation with Monsieur Delacour. \n\n\"Out of the way, out of the way!\" sang Mrs. Weasley, coming through the gate \nwith what appeared to be a giant, beach-ball-sized Snitch floating in front of her. Seconds \nlater Harry realized that it was his birthday cake, which Mrs. Weasley was suspending \nwith her wand, rather than risk carrying it over the uneven ground. When the cake had \nfinally landed in the middle of the table, Harry said, \n\n\"That looks amazing, Mrs. Weasley.\" \n\n\"Oh, it's nothing, dear,\" she said fondly. Over her shoulder, Ron gave Harry the \nthumbs-up and mouthed, Good one. \n\nBy seven o'clock all the guests had arrived, led into the house by Fred and George, \nwho had waited for them at the end of the lane. Hagrid had honored the occasion by \nwearing his best, and horrible, hairy brown suit. Although Lupin smiled as he shook \nHarry's hand, Harry thought he looked rather unhappy. It was all very odd; Tonks, beside \nhim, looked simply radiant. \n\n\"Happy birthday, Harry,\" she said, hugging him tightly. \n\n\"Seventeen, eh!\" said Hagrid as he accepted a bucket-sized glass of wine from \nFred. \"Six years ter the day since we met, Harry, d'yeh remember it?\" \n\n \n\n\"Vaguely,\" said Harry, grinning up at him. \"Didn't you smash down the front door, \ngive Dudley a pig's tail, and tell me I was a wizard?\" \n\n\"I forge' the details,\" Hagrid chortled. \"All righ', Ron, Hermione?\" \n\n\"We're fine,\" said Hermione. \"How are you?\" \n\n\"Ar, not bad. Bin busy, we got some newborn unicorns. I'll show yeh when yeh \nget back--\" Harry avoided Ron's and Hermione's gazes as Hagrid rummaged in his pocket. \n\"Here. Harry -- couldn't think what ter get teh, but then I remembered this.\" He pulled out \na small, slightly furry drawstring pouch with a long string, evidently intended to be worn \naround the neck. \"Mokeskin. Hide anythin' in there an' no one but the owner can get it out. \nThey're rare, them.\" \n\n\"Hagrid, thanks!\" \n\n\"'S'nothin',\" said Hagrid with a wave of a dustbin-lid-sized hand. \"An' there's \nCharlie! Always liked him -- hey! Charlie!\" \n\nCharlie approached, running his hand slightly ruefully over his new, brutally short \nhaircut. He was shorter than Ron, thickset, with a number of burns and scratches up his \nmuscley arms. \n\n\"Hi, Hagrid, how's it going?\" \n\n\"Bin meanin' ter write fer ages. How's Norbert doin'?\" \n\n\"Norbert?\" Charlie laughed. \"The Norwegian Ridgeback? We call her Norberta \nnow.\" \n\n\"Wha -- Norbert's a girl?\" \n\n\"Oh yeah,\" said Charlie. \n\n\"How can you tell?\" asked Hermione. \n\n\f\n\"They're a lot more vicious,\" said Charlie. He looked over his shoulder and \ndropped his voice. \"Wish Dad would hurry up and get here. Mum's getting edgy.\" \n\n \n\nThey all looked over at Mrs. Weasley. She was trying to talk to Madame Delacour \nwhile glancing repeatedly at the gate. \n\n\"I think we'd better start without Arthur,\" she called to the garden at large after a \nmoment or two. \"He must have been held up at -- oh!\" \n\nThey all saw it at the same time: a streak of light that came flying across the yard \nand onto the table, where it resolved itself into a bright silver weasel, which stood on its \nhind legs and spoke with Mr. Weasley's voice. \n\n\"Minister of Magic coming with me.\" \n\nThe Patronus dissolved into thin air, leaving Fleur's family peering in \nastonishment at the place where it had vanished. \n\n\"We shouldn't be here,\" said Lupin at once. \"Harry -- I'm sorry -- I'll explain some \nother time--\" \n\nHe seized Tonks\u2019s wrist and pulled her away; they reached the fence, climbed \nover it, and vanished from sight. Mrs. Weasley looked bewildered. \n\n\"The Minister -- but why--? I don't understand--\" \n\nBut there was no time to discuss the matter; a second later, Mr. Weasley had \nappeared out of thin air at the gate, accompanied by Rufus Scrimgeour, instantly \nrecognizable by his mane of grizzled hair. \n\nThe two newcomers marched across the yard toward the garden and the lantern-lit \ntable, where everybody sat in silence, watching them draw closer. As Scrimgeour came \nwithin range of the lantern light. Harry saw that he looked much older than the last time \nthat had met, scraggy and grim. \n\n\"Sorry to intrude,\" said Scrimgeour, as he limped to a halt before the table. \n\"Especially as I can see that I am gate-crashing a party.\" \n\n \n\nHis eyes lingered for a moment on the giant Snitch cake. \n\n\"Many happy returns.\" \n\n\"Thanks,\" said Harry. \n\n\"I require a private word with you,\" Scrimgeour went on. \"Also with Mr. Ronald \nWeasley and Miss Hermione Granger.\" \n\n\"Us?\" said Ron, sounding surprised. \"Why us?\" \n\n\"I shall tell you that when we are somewhere more private,\" said Scrimgeour. \"Is \nthere such a place?' he demanded of Mr. Weasley. \n\n\"Yes, of course,\" said Mr. Weasley, who looked nervous. \"The, er, sitting room, \nwhy don't you use that?\" \n\n\"You can lead the way,\" Scrimgeour said to Ron. \"There will be no need for you \nto accompany us, Arthur.\" \n\nHarry saw Mr. Weasley exchange a worried look with Mrs. Weasley as he, Ron, \nand Hermione stood up. As they led the way back to the house in silence, Harry knew \nthat the other two were thinking the same as he was; Scrimgeour must, somehow, had \nlearned that the three of them were planning to drop out of Hogwarts. \n\nScrimgeour did not speak as they all passed through the messed kitchen and into \nthe Burrow's sitting room. Although the garden had been full of soft golden evening light, \n\n\f\nit was already dark in here; Harry flicked his wand at the oil lamps as he entered and they \nilluminated the shabby but cozy room. Scrimgeour sat himself in the sagging armchair \nthat Mr. Weasley normally occupied, leaving Harry, Ron, and Hermione to squeeze side \nby side onto the sofa. Once they had done so, Scrimgeour spoke. \n\n\"I have some questions for the three of you, and I think it will be best if we do it \nindividually. If you two\" -- he pointed at Harry and Hermione -- \"can wait upstairs, I will \nstart with Ronald.\" \n\n \n\n\"We're not going anywhere,\" said Harry, while Hermione nodded vigorously. \n\"You can speak to us together, or not at all.\" \n\nScrimgeour gave Harry a cold, appraising look. Harry had the impression that the \nMinister was wondering whether it was worthwhile opening hostilities this early. \n\n\"Very well then, together,\" he said, shrugging. He cleared his throat. \"I am here, \nas I'm sure you know, because of Albus Dumbledore's will.\" \n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another. \n\n\"A surprise, apparently! You were not aware then that Dumbledore had left you \nanything?\" \n\n\"A-all of us?\" said Ron, \"Me and Hermione too?\" \n\n\"Yes, all of --\" \n\nBut Harry interrupted. \n\n\"Dumbledore died over a month ago. Why has it taken this long to give us what \nhe left us?\" \n\n\"Isn't it obvious?\" said Hermione, before Scrimgeour could answer. \"They wanted \nto examine whatever he's left us. You had no right to do that!\" she said, and her voice \ntrembled slightly. \n\n\"I had every right,\" said Scrimgeour dismissively. \"The Decree for Justifiable \nConfiscation gives the Ministry the power the confiscate the contents of a will--\" \n\n\"That law was created to stop wizards passing on Dark artifacts,\" said Hermione, \n\"and the Ministry is supposed to have powerful evidence that the deceased's possessions \nare illegal before seizing them! Are you telling me that you thought Dumbledore was \ntrying to pass us something cursed?\" \n\n\"Are you planning to follow a career in Magical Law, Miss Granger?\" asked \nScrimgeour. \n\n\"No, I'm not,\" retorted Hermione. \"I'm hoping to do some good in the world!\" \n\nRon laughed. Scrimgeour's eyes flickered toward him and away again as Harry \nspoke. \n\n\"So why have you decided to let us have our things now? Can't think of a pretext \nto keep them?\" \n\n\"No, it'll be because thirty-one days are up,\" said Hermione at once. \"They can't \nkeep the objects longer than that unless they can prove they're dangerous. Right?\" \n\n\"Would you say you were close to Dumbledore, Ronald?\" asked Scrimgeour, \nignoring Hermione. Ron looked startled. \n\n\"Me? Not -- not really... It was always Harry who...\" \n\nRon looked around at Harry and Hermione, to see Hermione giving him a stop-\ntalking-now! sort of look, but the damage was done; Scrimgeour looked as though he had \n\n\f\nheard exactly what he had expected, and wanted, to hear. He swooped like a bird of prey \nupon Ron's answer. \n\n\"If you were not very close to Dumbledore, how do you account for the fact that \nhe remembered you in his will? He made exceptionally few personal bequests. The vast \nmajority of his possessions -- his private library, his magical instruments, and other \npersonal effects -- were left to Hogwarts. Why do you think you were singled out?\" \n\n\"I...dunno,\" said Ron. \"I...when I say we weren't close...I mean, I think he liked \nme...\" \n\n\"You're being modest, Ron,\" said Hermione. \"Dumbledore was very fond of you.\" \n\nThis was stretching the truth to breaking point; as far as Harry knew, Ron and \nDumbledore had never been alone together, and direct contact between them had been \nnegligible. However, Scrimgeour did not seem to be listening. He put his hand inside his \ncloak and drew out a drawstring pouch much larger than the one Hagrid had given Harry. \nFrom it, he removed a scroll of parchment which he unrolled and read aloud. \n\n\"'The Last Will and Testament of Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore'... \nYes, here we are... 'To Ronald Bilius Weasley, I leave my Deluminator, in the hope that \nhe will remember me when he uses it.'\" \n\nScrimgeour took from the bag an object that Harry had seen before: It looked \nsomething like a silver cigarette lighter, but it had, he knew, the power to suck all light \nfrom a place, and restore it, with a simple click. Scrimgeour leaned forward and passed \nthe Deluminator to Ron, who took it and turned it over in the fingers looking stunned. \n\n\"That is a valuable object,\" said Scrimgeour, watching Ron. \"It may even be \nunique. Certainly it is of Dumbledore's own design. Why would he have left you and item \nso rare?\" \n\nRon shook his head, looking bewildered. \n\n\"Dumbledore must have taught thousands of students,\" Scrimgeour persevered. \n\"Yet the only ones he remembered in his will are you three. Why is that? To what use did \nhe think you would put to the Deluminator, Mr. Weasley?\" \n\n\"Put out lights, I s'pose,\" mumbled Ron. \"What else could I do with it?\" \n\nEvidently Scrimgeour had no suggestions. After squinting at Ron for a moment or \ntow, he turned back to Dumbledore's will. \n\n\"'To Miss Hermione Jean Granger, I leave my copy of The Tales of Beedle the \nBard, in the hope that she will find it entertaining and instructive.'\" \n\nScrimgeour now pulled out of the bag a small book that looked as ancient as the \ncopy of Secrets of the Darkest Art upstairs. Its binding was stained and peeling in places. \nHermione took it from Scrimgeour without a word. She held the book in her lap and \ngazed at it. Harry saw that the title was in runes; he had never learned to read them. As he \nlooked, a tear splashed onto the embossed symbols. \n\n\"Why do you think Dumbledore left you that book, Miss Granger?\" asked \nScrimgeour. \n\n\"He... he knew I liked books,\" said Hermione in a thick voice, mopping her eyes \nwith her sleeve. \n\n\"But why that particular book?\" \n\n\"I don't know. He must have thought I'd enjoy it.\" \n\n\"Did you ever discuss codes, or any means of passing secret messages, with \nDumbledore?\" \n\n\f\n\"No, I didn't,\" said Hermione, still wiping her eyes on her sleeve. \"And if the \nMinistry hasn't found any hidden codes in this book in thirty-one days, I doubt that I \nwill.\" \n\nShe suppressed a sob. They were wedged together so tightly that Ron had \ndifficulty extracting his arm to put it around Hermione's shoulders. Scrimgeour turned \nback to the will. \n\n\"'To Harry James Potter,'\" he read, and Harry's insides contracted with a sudden \nexcitement, \"'I leave the Snitch he caught in his first Quidditch match at Hogwarts, as a \nreminder of the rewards of perseverance and skill.'\" \n\nAs Scrimgeour pulled out the tiny, walnut-sized golden ball, its silver wings \nfluttered rather feebly, and Harry could not help feeling a definite sense of anticlimax. \n\n\"Why did Dumbledore leave you this Snitch?\" asked Scrimgeour. \n\n\"No idea,\" said Harry. \"For the reasons you just read out, I suppose... to remind \nme what you can get if you... persevere and whatever it was.\" \n\n\"You think this a mere symbolic keepsake, then?\" \n\n\"I suppose so,\" said Harry. \"What else could it be?\" \n\n\"I'm asking the questions,\" said Scrimgeour, shifting his chair a little closer to the \nsofa. Dusk was really falling outside now; the marquee beyond the windows towered \nghostly white over the hedge. \n\n\"I notice that your birthday cake is in the shape of a Snitch,\" Scrimgeour said to \nHarry. \"Why is that?\" \n\nHermione laughed derisively. \n\n\"Oh, it can't be a reference to the fact Harry's a great Seeker, that's way too \nobvious,\" she said. \"There must be a secret message from Dumbledore hidden in the \nicing!\" \n\n\"I don't think there's anything hidden in the icing,\" said Scrimgeour, \"but a Snitch \nwould be a very good hiding place for a small object. You know why, I'm sure?\" \n\nHarry shrugged, Hermione, however, answered: Harry thought that answering \nquestions correctly was such a deeply ingrained habit she could not suppress the urge. \n\n\"Because Snitches have flesh memories,\" she said. \n\n\"What?\" said Harry and Ron together; both considered Hermione's Quidditch \nknowledge negligible. \n\n\"Correct,\" said Scrimgeour. \"A Snitch is not touched by bare skin before it is \nreleased, not even by the maker, who wears gloves. It carries an enchantment by which it \ncan identify the first human to lay hands upon it, in case of a disputed capture. This \nSnitch\" -- he held up the tiny golden ball -- \"will remember your touch, Potter. \n\nIt occurs to me that Dumbledore, who had prodigious magical skill, whatever his \nother faults, might have enchanted this Snitch so that it will open only for you.\" \n\nHarry's heart was beating rather fast. He was sure that Scrimgeour was right. How \ncould he avoid taking the Snitch with his bare hand in front of the Minister? \n\n\"You don't say anything,\" said Scrimgeour. \"Perhaps you already know what the \nSnitch contains?\" \n\n\"No,\" said Harry, still wondering how he could appear to touch the Snitch without \nreally doing so. If only he knew Legilimency, really knew it, and could read Hermione's \nmind; he could practically hear her brain whizzing beside him. \n\n\"Take it,\" said Scrimgeour quietly. \n\n\f\nHarry met the Minister's yellow eyes and knew he had no option but to obey. He \nheld out his hand, and Scrimgeour leaned forward again and place the Snitch, slowly and \ndeliberately, into Harry's palm. \n\nNothing happened. As Harry's fingers closed around the Snitch, its tired wings \nfluttered and were still. Scrimgeour, Ron, and Hermione continued to gaze avidly at the \nnow partially concealed ball, as if still hoping it might transform in some way. \n\n\"That was dramatic,\" said Harry coolly. Both Ron and Hermione laughed. \n\n\"That's all, then, is it?\" asked Hermione, making to raise herself off the sofa. \n\n\"Not quite,\" said Scrimgeour, who looked bad tempered now. \"Dumbledore left \nyou a second bequest, Potter.\" \n\n\"What is it?\" asked Harry, excitement rekindling. \n\nScrimgeour did not bother to read from the will this time. \n\n\"The sword of Godric Gryffindor,\" he said. Hermione and Ron both stiffened. \nHarry looked around for a sign of the ruby-encrusted hilt, but Scrimgeour did not pull the \nsword from the leather pouch, which in any case looked much too small to contain it. \n\n\"So where is it?\" Harry asked suspiciously. \n\n\"Unfortunately,\" said Scrimgeour, \"that sword was not Dumbledore's to give \naway. The sword of Godric Gryffindor is an important historical artifact, and as such, \nbelongs--\" \n\n\"It belongs to Harry!\" said Hermione hotly. \"It chose him, he was the one who \nfound it, it came to him out of the Sorting Hat--\" \n\n\"According to reliable historical sources, the sword may present itself to any \nworthy Gryffindor,\" said Scrimgeour. \"That does not make it the exclusive property of \nMr. Potter, whatever Dumbledore may have decided.\" Scrimgeour scratched his badly \nshaven cheek, scrutinizing Harry. \"Why do you think--?\" \n\n\"--Dumbledore wanted to give me the sword?\" said Harry, struggling to keep his \ntemper. \"Maybe he thought it would look nice on my wall.\" \n\n\"This is not a joke, Potter!\" growled Scrimgeour. \"Was it because Dumbledore \nbelieved that only the sword of Godric Gryffindor could defeat the Heir of Slytherin? Did \nhe wish to give you that sword, Potter, because he believed, as do many, that you are the \none destined to destroy He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named?\" \n\n\"Interesting theory,\" said Harry. \"Has anyone ever tried sticking a sword in \nVoldemort? Maybe the Ministry should put some people onto that, instead of wasting \ntheir time stripping down Deluminators or covering up breakouts from Azkaban. So this \nis what you've been doing, Minister, shut up in your office, trying to break open a Snitch? \nPeople are dying \u2013 I was nearly one of them \u2013 Voldemort chased me across three \ncountries, he killed Mad-Eye Moody, but there's no word about any of that from the \nMinistry, has there? And you still expect us to cooperate with you!\" \n\n\"You go too far!\" shouted Scrimgeour, standing up: Harry jumped to his feet too. \nScrimgeour limped toward Harry and jabbed him hard in the chest with the point of his \nwand; It singed a hole in Harry's T-shirt like a lit cigarette. \n\n\"Oi!\" said Ron, jumping up and raising his own wand, but Harry said, \n\n\"No! D'you want to give him an excuse to arrest us?\" \n\n\"Remembered you're not at school, have you?\" said Scrimgeour breathing hard \ninto Harry's face. \"Remembered that I am not Dumbledore, who forgave your insolence \n\n\f\nand insubordination? You may wear that scar like a crown, Potter, but it is not up to a \nseventeen-year-old boy to tell me how to do my job! It's time you learned some respect!\" \n\n\"It's time you earned it.\" said Harry. \n\nThe floor trembled; there was a sound of running footsteps, then the door to the \nsitting room burst open and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley ran in. \n\n\"We --- we thought we heard --\" began Mr. Weasley, looking thoroughly alarmed \nat the sight of Harry and the Minister virtually nose to nose. \n\n\"\u2014raised voices,\" panted Mrs. Weasley. \n\nScrimgeour took a couple of steps back from Harry, glancing at the hole he had \nmade in Harry's T-shirt. He seemed to regret his loss of temper. \n\n\"It \u2013 it was nothing,\" he growled. \"I \u2026 regret your attitude,\" he said, looking \nHarry full in the face once more. \"You seem to think that the Ministry does not desire \nwhat you \u2013 what Dumbledore \u2013 desired. We ought to work together.\" \n\n\"I don't like your methods, Minister,\" said Harry. \"Remember?\" \n\nFor the second time, he raised his right fist and displayed to Scrimgeour the scar \nthat still showed white on the back of it, spelling I must not tell lies . Scrimgeour's \nexpression hardened. He turned away without another word and limped from the room. \nMrs. Weasley hurried after him; Harry heard her stop at the back door. After a minute or \nso she called, \"He's gone!\" \n\nWhat did he want?\" Mr. Weasley asked, looking around at Harry, Ron, and \nHermione as Mrs. Weasley came hurrying back to them. \n\n\"To give us what Dumbledore left us,\" said Harry. \"They've only just released the \ncontent of his will.\" \n\nOutside in the garden, over the dinner tables, the three objects Scrimgeour had \ngiven them were passed from hand to hand. Everyone exclaimed over the Deluminator \nand The Tales of Beedle the Bard and lamented the fact that Scrimgeour had refused to \npass on the sword, but none of them could offer any suggestion as to why Dumbledore \nwould have left Harry an old Snitch. As Mr. Weasley examined the Deluminator for the \nthird of fourth time, Mrs. Weasley said tentatively, \"Harry, dear, everyone's awfully \nhungry we didn't like to start without you\u2026 Shall I serve dinner now?\" \n\nThey all ate rather hurriedly and then after a hasty chorus of \"Happy Birthday\" \nand much gulping of cake, the party broke up. Hagrid, who was invited to the wedding \nthe following day, but was far too bulky to sleep in the overstretched Burrow, left to set \nup a tent for himself in a neighboring field. \n\n\"Meet us upstairs,\" Harry whispered to Hermione, while they helped Mrs. \nWeasley restore the garden to its normal state. \"After everyone's gone to bed.\" \n\nUp in the attic room, Ron examined his Deluminator, and Harry filled Hagrid's \nmokeskin purse, not with gold, but with those items he most prized, apparently worthless \nthough some of them were the Marauder's Map, the shard of Sirius's enchanted mirror, \nand R.A.B.'s locket. He pulled the string tight and slipped the purse around his neck, then \nsat holding the old Snitch and watching its wings flutter feebly. At last, Hermione tapped \non the door and tiptoed inside. \n\n\"Muffiato,\" she whispered, waving her wand in the direction of the stairs. \n\n\"Thought you didn't approve of that spell?\" said Ron. \n\n\"Times change,\" said Hermione. \"Now, show us that Deluminator.\" \n\n\f\nRon obliged at once. Holding I up in front of him, he clicked it. The solitary lamp \nthey had lit went out at once. \n\n\"The thing is,\" whispered Hermione through the dark, \"we could have achieved \nthat with Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.\" \n\nThere was a small click, and the ball of light from the lamp flew back to the \nceiling and illuminated them all once more. \n\n\"Still, it's cool,\" said Ron, a little defensively. \"And from what they said, \nDumbledore invented it himself!\" \n\n\"I know but, surely he wouldn't have singled you out in his will just to help us \nturn out the lights!\" \n\n\"D'you think he knew the Ministry would confiscate his will and examine \neverything he'd left us?\" asked Harry. \n\n\"Definitely,\" said Hermione. \"He couldn't tell us in the will why he was leaving \nus these things, but that will doesn't explain\u2026\" \n\n\"\u2026 why he couldn't have given us a hint when he was alive?\" asked Ron. \n\n\"Well, exactly,\" said Hermione, now flicking through The Tales of Beedle the \nBard. \"If these things are important enough to pass on right under the nose of the \nMinistry, you'd think he'd have left us know why\u2026 unless he thought it was obvious?\" \n\n\"Thought wrong, then, didn't he?\" said Ron. \"I always said he was mental. \nBrilliant and everything, but cracked. Leaving Harry an old Snitch \u2013 what the hell was \nthat about?\" \n\n\"I've no idea,\" said Hermione. \"When Scrimgeour made you take it, Harry, I was \nso sure that something was going to happen!\" \n\n\"Yeah, well,\" said Harry, his pulse quickened as he raised the Snitch in his fingers. \n\"I wasn't going to try too hard in front of Scrimgeour was I?\" \n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Hermione. \n\n\"The Snitch I caught in my first ever Quidditch match?\" said Harry. \"Don't you \nremember?\" \n\nHermione looked simply bemused. Ron, however, gasped, pointing frantically \nfrom Harry to the Snitch and back again until he found his voice. \n\n\"That was the one you nearly swallowed!\" \n\n\"Exactly,\" said Harry, and with his heart beating fast, he pressed his mouth to the \nSnitch. \n\nIt did not open. Frustration and bitter disappointment welled up inside him: He \nlowered the golden sphere, but then Hermione cried out. \n\n\"Writing! There's writing on it, quick, look!\" \nHe nearly dropped the Snitch in surprise and excitement. Hermione was quite right. \nEngraved upon the smooth golden surface, where seconds before there had been nothing, \nwere five words written in the thin, slanted handwriting that Harry recognized as \nDumbledore's \n\nI open at the close. \n\nHe had barely read them when the words vanished again. \n\n\"I open at the close\u2026.\" What's that supposed to mean?\" \n\nHermione and Ron shook their heads, looking blank. \n\n\"I open at the close\u2026 at the close\u2026 I open at the close\u2026\" \n\n\f\nBut no matter how often they repeated the words, with many different inflections, \nthey were unable to wring any more meaning from them. \n\n\"And the sword,\" said Ron finally, when they had at last abandoned their attempts \nto divine meaning in the Snitch's inscription. \n\n\"Why did he want Harry to have the sword?\" \n\n\"And why couldn't he just have told me?\" Harry said quietly. \"I was there, it was \nright there on the wall of his office during all our talks last year! If he wanted me to have \nit, why didn't he just give it to me then?\" \n\nHe felt as thought he were sitting in an examination with a question he ought to \nhave been able to answer in front of him, his brain slow and unresponsive. Was there \nsomething he had missed in the long talks with Dumbledore last year? Ought he to know \nwhat it all meant? Had Dumbledore expected him to understand? \n\n\"And as for this book.\" Said Hermione, \"The Tales of Beedle the Bard \u2026 I've \nnever even heard of them!\" \n\n\"You've never heard of The Tales of Beedle the Bard?\" said Ron incredulously. \n\"You're kidding, right?\" \n\n\"No, I'm not,\" said Hermione in surprise. \"Do you know them then?\" \n\n\"Well, of course I do!\" \n\nHarry looked up, diverted. The circumstance of Ron having read a book that \nHermione had not was unprecedented. Ron, however, looked bemused by their surprise. \n\n\"Oh come on! All the old kids' stories are supposed to be Beedle's aren't they? \n'The Fountain of Fair Fortune' \u2026 'The Wizard and the Hopping Pot'\u2026 'Babbitty Rabbitty \nand her Cackling Stump'\u2026\" \n\n\"Excuse me?\" said Hermione giggling. \"What was the last one?\" \n\n\"Come off it!\" said Ron, looking in disbelief from Harry to Hermione. \"You \nmust've heard of Babbitty Rabbitty \u2013\" \n\n\"Ron, you know full well Harry and I were brought up by Muggles!\" said \nHermione. \"We didn't hear stories like that when we were little, we heard 'Snow White \nand the Seven Dwarves' and 'Cinderella' \u2013\" \n\n\"What's that, an illness?\" asked Ron. \n\n\"So these are children's stories?\" asked Hermione, bending against over the runes. \n\n\"Yeah.\" Said Ron uncertainly. \"I mean, just what you hear, you know, that all \nthese old stories came from Beedle. I dunno what they're like in the original versions.\" \n\n\"But I wonder why Dumbledore thought I should read them?\" \n\nSomething cracked downstairs. \n\n\"Probably just Charlie, now Mum's asleep, sneaking off to regrow his hair,\" said \nRon nervously. \n\n\"All the same, we should get to bed,\" whispered Hermione. \"It wouldn't do to \noversleep tomorrow.\" \n\n\"No,\" agreed Ron. \"A brutal triple murder by the bridegroom's mother might put a \nbit of damper on the wedding. I'll get the light.\" \n\nAnd he clicked the Deluminator once more as Hermione left the room. \n\n\f\nChapter Eight \n\nThe Wedding \n\nThree o\u2019clock on the following afternoon found Harry, Ron, Fred and George \nstanding outside the great white marquee in the orchard, awaiting the arrival of the \nwedding guests. Harry had taken a large dose of Polyjuice Potion and was now the \ndouble of a redheaded Muggle boy from the local village, Ottery St. Catchpole, from \nwhom Fred had stolen hairs using a Summoning Charm. The plan was to introduce \nHarry as \u201cCousin Barny\u201d and trust to the great number of Weasley relatives to \ncamouflage him. \n\n All four of them were clutching seating plans, so that they could help show people \nto the right seats. A host of white-robed waiters had arrived an hour earlier, along with a \ngolden jacketed band, and all of these wizards were currently sitting a short distance \naway under a tree. Harry could see a blue haze of pipe smoke issuing from the spot. \nBehind Harry, the entrance to the marquee revealed rows and rows of fragile golden \nchairs set on either side of a long purple carpet. The supporting poles were entwined with \nwhite and gold flowers. Fred and George had fastened an enormous bunch of golden \nballoons over the exact point where Bill and Fleur would shortly become husband and \nwife. Outside, butterflies and bees were hovering lazily over the grass and hedgerow. \nHarry was rather uncomfortable. The Muggle boy whose appearance he was affecting \nwas slightly fatter than him and his dress robes felt hot and tight in the full glare of a \nsummer\u2019s day. \n\n\u201cWhen I get married,\u201d said Fred, tugging at the collar of his own robes, \u201cI won\u2019t \nbe bothering with any of this nonsense. You can all wear what you like, and I\u2019ll put a full \nBody Bird Curse on Mum until it\u2019s all over.\u201d \n\n \u201cShe wasn\u2019t too bad this morning, considering,\u201d said George. \u201cCried a bit about \nPercy not being here, but who wants him. Oh blimey, brace yourselves, here they come, \nlook.\u201d \n\n Brightly colored figures were appearing, one by one out of nowhere at the distant \nboundary of the yard. Within minutes a procession had formed, which began to snake its \nway up through the garden toward the marquee. Exotic flowers and bewitched birds \nfluttered on the witches\u2019 hats, while precious gems glittered from many of the wizards\u2019 \ncravats; a hum of excited chatter grew louder and louder, drowning the sound of the bees \nas the crowd approached the tent. \n\n \u201cExcellent, I think I see a few veela cousins,\u201d said George, craning his neck for a \nbetter look. \u201cThey\u2019ll need help understanding our English customs, I\u2019ll look after \nthem\u2026.\u201d \n\n \u201cNot so fast, Your Holeyness,\u201d said Fred, and darting past the gaggle of middle-\naged witches heading for the procession, he said, \u201cHere \u2013 permetiez moi to assister \nvous,\u201d to a pair of pretty French girls, who giggled and allowed him to escort them inside. \nGeorge was left to deal with the middle-aged witches and Ron took charge of Mr. \nWeasley\u2019s old Ministry-colleague Perkins, while a rather deaf old couple fell to Harry\u2019s \nlot. \n\n \u201cWotcher,\u201d said a familiar voice as he came out of the marquee again and found \nTonks and Lupin at the front of the queue. She had turned blonde for the occasion. \n\u201cArthur told us you were the one with the curly hair. Sorry about last night,\u201d she added \n\n\f\nin a whisper as Harry led them up the aisle. \u201cThe Ministry\u2019s being very anti-werewolf at \nthe museum and we thought our presence might not do you any favors.\u201d \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s fine, I understand,\u201d said Harry, speaking more to Lupin than Tonks. Lupin \ngave him a swift smile, but as they turned away Harry saw Lupin\u2019s face fall again into \nlines of misery. He did not understand it, but there was no time to dwell on the matter. \nHagrid was causing a certain amount of disruption. Having misunderstood Fred\u2019s \ndirections as he had sat himself, not upon the magically enlarged and reinforced seat set \naside for him in the back row, but on five sets that now resembled a large pile of golden \nmatchsticks. \n\n While Mr. Weasley repaired the damage and Hagrid shouted apologies to \nanybody who would listen, Harry hurried back to the entrance to find Ron face-to-face \nwith a most eccentric-looking wizard. Slightly cross-eyed, with shoulder-length white \nhair the texture of candyfloss, he wore a cap whose tassel dangled in front of his nose and \nrobes of an eye-watering shade of egg-yolk yellow. An odd symbol, rather like a \ntriangular eye, glistened from a golden chain around his neck. \n\n \u201cXenophilius Lovegood,\u201d he said, extending a hand to Harry, \u201cmy daughter and I \nlive just over the hill, so kind of the good Weasleys to invite us. But I think you know \nmy Luna?\u201d he added to Ron. \n\n \u201cYes,\u201d said Ron. \u201cIsn\u2019t she with you?\u201d \n\n \u201cShe lingered in that charming little garden to say hello to the gnomes, such a \nglorious infestation! How few wizards realize just how much we can learn from the wise \nlittle gnomes \u2013 or, to give them their correct name, the Gernumbli gardensi.\u201d \n\n \u201cOurs do know a lot of excellent swear words,\u201d said Ron, \u201cbut I think Fred and \nGeorge taught them those.\u201d \n\n He led a party of warlocks into the marquee as Luna rushed up. \n\n \u201cHello, Harry!\u201d she said. \n\n \u201cEr \u2013 my name\u2019s Barry,\u201d said Harry, flummoxed. \n\n \u201cOh, have you changed that too?\u201d she asked brightly. \n\n \u201cHow did you know -?\u201d \n\n \u201cOh, just your expression,\u201d she said. \n\n Like her father, Luna was wearing bright yellow robes, which she had \naccessorized with a large sunflower in her hair. Once you get over the brightness of it all, \nthe general effect was quite pleasant. At least there were no radishes dangling from her \nears. \n\n Xenophilius, who was deep in conversation with an acquaintance, had missed the \nexchange between Luna and Harry. Biding the wizard farewell, he turned to his daughter, \nwho held up her finger and said, \u201cDaddy, look \u2013 one of the gnomes actually bit me.\u201d \n\n \u201cHow wonderful! Gnome saliva is enormously beneficial.\u201d Said Mr. Lovegood, \nseizing Luna\u2019s outstretched fingers and examining the bleeding puncture marks. \u201cLuna, \nmy love, if you should feel any burgeoning talent today \u2013 perhaps an unexpected urge to \nsing opera or to declaims in Mermish \u2013 do not repress it! You may have been gifted by \nthe Gernumblies!\u201d \n\n Ron, passing them in the opposite direction let out a loud snort. \n\n \u201cRon can laugh,\u201d said Luna serenely as Harry led her and Xenophilius toward \ntheir seats, \u201cbut my father has done a lot of research on Gernumbli magic.\u201d \n\n\f\n \u201cReally?\u201d said Harry, who had long since decided not to challenge Luna or her \nfather\u2019s peculiar views. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to put anything on that bite, \nthough?\u201d \n\n \u201cOh, it\u2019s fine,\u201d said Luna, sucking her finger in a dreamy fashion and looking \nHarry up and down. \u201cYou look smart. I told Daddy most people would probably wear \ndress robes, but he believes you ought to wear sun colors to a wedding, for luck, you \nknow.\u201d \n\n As she drifted off after her father, Ron reappeared with an elderly witch clutching \nhis arm. Her beaky nose, red-rimmed eyes, and leathery pink hat gave her the look of a \nbad-tempered flamingo. \n\n \u201c\u2026and your hair\u2019s much too long, Ronald, for a moment I thought you were \nGinevra. Merlin\u2019s beard, what is Xenophilius Lovegood wearing? He looks like an \nomelet. And who are you?\u201d she barked at Harry. \n\n \u201cOh yeah, Auntie Muriel, this is our cousin Barny.\u201d \n\n \u201cAnother Weasley? You breed like gnomes. Isn\u2019t Harry Potter here? I was \nhoping to meet him. I thought he was a friend of yours, Ronald, or have you merely been \nboasting?\u201d \n\n \u201cNo \u2013 he couldn\u2019t come \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cHmm. Made an excuse, did he? Not as gormless as he looks in press \nphotographs, then. I\u2019ve just been instructing the bride on how best to wear my tiara,\u201d she \nshouted at Harry. \u201cGoblin-made, you know, and been in my family for centuries. She\u2019s a \ngood-looking girl, but still \u2013 French. Well, well, find me a good seat, Ronald, I am a \nhundred and seven and I ought not to be on my feet too long.\u201d \n\n Ron gave Harry a meaningful look as he passed and did not reappear for some \ntime. When next they met at the entrance, Harry had shown a dozen more people to their \nplaces. The Marquee was nearly full now and for the first time there was no queue \noutside. \n\n \u201cNightmare, Muriel is,\u201d said Ron, mopping his forehead on his sleeve. \u201cShe used \nto come for Christmas every year, then, thank God, she took offense because Fred and \nGeorge set off a Dungbomb under her chair at diner. Dad always says she\u2019ll have written \nthem out of her will \u2013 like they care, they\u2019re going to end up richer than anyone in the \nfamily, rate they\u2019re going\u2026 Wow,\u201d he added, blinking rather rapidly as Hermione came \nhurrying toward them. \u201cYou look great!\u201d \n\n \u201cAlways the tone of surprise,\u201d said Hermione, though she smiled. She was \nwearing a floaty, lilac-colored dress with matching high heels; her hair was sleek and \nshiny. \u201cYour Great-Aunt Muriel doesn\u2019t agree, I just met her upstairs while she was \ngiving Fleur the tiara. She said, \u2018Oh dear, is this the Muggle-born?\u2019 and then, \u2018Bad \nposture and skinny ankles.\u2019\u201d \n\n \u201cDon\u2019t take it personally, she\u2019s rude to everyone,\u201d said Ron. \n\n \u201cTalking about Muriel?\u201d inquired George, reemerging from the marquee with \nFred. \u201cYeah, she\u2019s just told me my ears are lopsided. Old bat. I wish old Uncle Bilius \nwas still with us, though; he was a right laugh at weddings.\u201d \n\n \u201cWasn\u2019t he the one who saw a Grim and died twenty-four hours later?\u201d asked \nHermione. \n\n \u201cWell, yeah, he went a bit odd toward the end,\u201d conceded George. \n\n\f\n \u201cBut before he went loopy he was the life and soul of the party,\u201d said Fred. \u201cHe \nused to down an entire bottle of firewhisky, then run onto the dance floor, hoist up his \nrobes, and start pulling bunches of flowers out of his \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cYes, he sounds a real charmer,\u201d said Hermione, while Harry roared with laughter. \n\n \u201cNever married, for some reason,\u201d said Ron. \n\n \u201cYou amaze me,\u201d said Hermione. \n\n They were all laughing so much that none of them noticed the latecomer, a dark-\nhaired young man with a large, curved nose and thick black eyebrows, until he held out \nhis invitation to Ron and said, with his eyes on Hermione, \u201cYou look vunderful.\u201d \n\n \u201cViktor!\u201d she shrieked, and dropped her small beaded bag, which made a loud \nthump quite disproportionate to its size. As she scrambled, blushing, to pick it up, she \nsaid \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were \u2013 goodness \u2013 it\u2019s lovely to see \u2013 how are you?\u201d \n\n Ron\u2019s ears had turned bright red again. After glancing at Krum\u2019s invitation as if \nhe did not believe a word of it, he said, much too loudly, \u201chow come you\u2019re here?\u201d \n\n \u201cFleur invited me,\u201d said Krum, eyebrows raised. \n\n Harry, who had no grudge against Krum, shook hands; then feeling that it would \nbe prudent to remove Krum from Ron\u2019s vicinity, offered to show him his seat. \n\n \u201cYour friend is not pleased to see me,\u201d said Krum, as they entered the now \npacked marquee. \u201cOr is he a relative?\u201d he added with a glance at Harry\u2019s red curly hair. \n\n \u201cCousin.\u201d Harry muttered, but Krum was not really listening. His appearance was \ncausing a stir, particularly amongst the veela cousins: He was, after all, a famous \nQuidditch player. While people were still craning their necks to get a good look at him, \nRon, Hermione, Fred, and George came hurrying down the aisle. \n\n \u201cTime to sit down,\u201d Fred told Harry, \u201cor we\u2019re going to get run over by the \nbride.\u201d \n\n Harry, Ron and Hermione took their seats in the second row behind Fred and \nGeorge. Hermione looked rather pink and Ron\u2019s ears were still scarlet. After a few \nmoments he muttered to Harry, \u201cDid you see he\u2019s grown a stupid little beard?\u201d \n\n Harry gave a noncommittal grunt. \n\n A sense of jittery anticipation had filled the warm tent, the general murmuring \nbroken by occasional spurts of excited laughter. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley strolled up the \naisle, smiling and waving at relatives; Mrs. Weasley was wearing a brand-new set of \namethyst colored robes with a matching hat. \n\n A moment later Bill and Charlie stood up at the front of the marquee, both \nwearing dress robes, with larger white roses in their buttonholes; Fred wolf-whistled and \nthere was an outbreak of giggling from the veela cousins. Then the crowd fell silent as \nmusic swelled from what seemed to be the golden balloons. \n\n \u201cOoooh!\u201d said Hermione, swiveling around in her seat to look at the entrance. \n\n A great collective sigh issued from the assembled witches and wizards as \nMonsieur Delacour and Fleur came walking up the aisle, Fleur gliding, Monsieur \nDelacour bouncing and beaming. Fleur was wearing a very simple white dress and \nseemed to be emitting a strong, silvery glow. While her radiance usually dimmed \neveryone else by comparison, today it beautified everybody it fell upon. Ginny and \nGabrielle, both wearing golden dresses, looked even prettier than usual and once Fleur \nhad reached for him, Bill did not look as though he had ever met Fenrit Greyback. \n\n\f\n \u201cLadies and gentlemen,\u201d said a slightly singsong voice, and with a slight shock, \nHarry saw the same small, tufty-hired wizard who had presided at Dumbledore\u2019s funeral, \nnow standing in front of Bill and Fleur. \u201cWe are gathered here today to celebrate the \nunion of two faithful souls\u2026\u201d \n\n \u201cYes, my tiara set off the whole thing nicely,\u201d said Auntie Muriel in a rather \ncarrying whisper. \u201cBut I must say, Ginevra\u2019s dress is far too low cut.\u201d \n\n Ginny glanced around, grinning, winked at Harry, then quickly faced the front \nagain. Harry\u2019s mind wandered a long way from the marquee, back to the afternoons \nspent alone with Ginny in lonely parts of the school grounds. They seemed so long ago; \nthey had always seemed too good to be true, as though he had been stealing shining hours \nfrom a normal person\u2019s life, a person without a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead\u2026. \n\n \u201cDo you, William Arthur, take Fleur Isabelle\u2026?\u201d \n\n In the front row, Mrs. Weasley and Madame Delacour were both sobbing quietly \ninto scraps of lace. Trumpetlike sounds from the back of the marquee told everyone that \nHagrid had taken out one of his own tablecloth-sized handkerchiefs. Hermione turned \naround and beamed at Harry; her eyes too were full of tears. \n\n \u201c\u2026then I declare you bonded for life.\u201d \n\n The tufty-haired wizard waved his hand high over the heads of Bill and Fleur and \na shower of silver stars fell upon them, spiraling around their now entwined figures. As \nFred and George led a round of applause, the golden balloons overhead burst. Birds of \nparadise and tiny golden bells flew and floated out of them, adding their songs and \nchimes to the din. \n\n \u201cLadies and gentlemen!\u201d called the tufty-haired wizard. \u201cIf you would please \nstand up!\u201d \n\n They all did so, Auntie Muriel grumbling audibly; he waved his wand again. The \nscars on which they had been sitting rose gracefully into the air as the canvas walls of the \nmarquee vanished, so that they stood beneath a canopy supported by golden poles, with a \nglorious view of the sunlit orchard and surrounding countryside. Next, a pool of molten \ngold spread from the center of the tent to form a gleaming dance floor; the hovering \nchairs grouped themselves around small, white-clothed tables, which all floated \ngracefully back to earth round it, and the golden-jacketed hand trooped toward a podium. \n\n \u201cSmooth,\u201d said Ron approvingly as the waiters popped up on all sides, some \nhearing silver trays of pumpkin juice, butterbeer, and firewhisky, others tottering piles of \ntarts and sandwiches. \n\n \u201cWe should go and congratulate them!\u201d said Hermione, standing on tiptoe to see \nthe place where Bill and Fleur had vanished amid a crowd of well-wishers. \n\n \u201cWe\u2019ll have time later,\u201d shrugged Ron, snatching three butterbeers from a passing \ntray and handing one to Harry. \u201cHermione, cop hold, let\u2019s grab a table\u2026. Not there! \nNowhere near Muriel \u2013\u201c \n\n Ron led the way across the empty dance floor, glancing left and right as he went; \nHarry felt sure that he was keeping an eye out for Krum. By the time they had reached \nthe other side of the marquee, most of the tables were occupied: The emptiest was the one \nwhere Luna sat alone. \n\n \u201cAll right if we join you?\u201d asked Ron. \n\n \u201cOh yes,\u201d she said happily. \u201cDaddy\u2019s just gone to give Bill and Fleur our \npresent.\u201d \n\n\f\n \u201cWhat is it, a lifetime\u2019s supply of Gurdyroots?\u201d asked Ron. \n\n Hermione aimed a kick at him under the table, but caught Harry instead. Eyes \nwatering in pain, Harry lost track of the conversation for a few moments. \n\n The band had begun to play, Bill and Fleur took to the dance floor first, to great \napplause; after a while, Mr. Weasley led Madame Delacour onto the floor, followed by \nMr. Weasley and Fleur\u2019s father. \n\n \u201cI like this song,\u201d said Luna, swaying in time to the waltzlike tune, and a few \nseconds later she stood up and glided onto the dance floor, where she revolved on the \nspot, quite alone, eyes closed and waving her arms. \n\n \u201cShe\u2019s great isn\u2019t she?\u201d said Ron admiringly. \u201cAlways good value.\u201d \n\n But the smile vanished from his face at once: Viktor Krum had dropped into \nLuna\u2019s vacant seat. Hermione looked pleasurably flustered but this time Krum had not \ncome to compliment her. With a scowl on his face he said, \u201cWho is that man in the \nyellow?\u201d \n\n \u201cThat\u2019s Xenophilius Lovegood, he\u2019s the father of a friend of ours,\u201d said Ron. His \npugnacious tone indicated that they were not about to laugh at Xenophilius, despite the \nclear provocation. \u201cCome and dance,\u201d he added abruptly to Hermione. \n\n She looked taken aback, but pleased too, and got up. They vanished together into \nthe growing throng on the dance floor. \n\n \u201cAh, they are together now?\u201d asked Krum, momentarily distracted. \n\n \u201cEr \u2013 sort of,\u201d said Harry. \n\n \u201cWho are you?\u201d Krum asked. \n\n \u201cBarny Weasley.\u201d \n\n They shook hands. \n\n \u201cYou, Barny \u2013 you know this man Lovegood well?\u201d \n\n \u201cNo, I only met him today. Why?\u201d \n\n Krum glowered over the top of his drink, watching Xenophilius, who was chatting \nto several warlocks on the other side of the dance floor. \n\n \u201cBecause,\u201d said Krum, \u201cIf he vus not a guest of Fleur\u2019s I vould dud him, here and \nnow, for veering that filthy sign upon his chest.\u201d \n\n \u201cSign?\u201d said Harry, looking over at Xenophilius too. The strange triangular eye \nwas gleaming on his chest. \u201cWhy? What\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d \n\n \u201cGrindelvald. That is Grindelvald\u2019s sign.\u201d \n\n \u201cGrindelwald\u2026 the Dark wizard Dumbledore defeated?\u201d \n\n \u201cExactly.\u201d \n\n Krum\u2019s jaw muscles worked as if he were chewing, then he said, \u201cGrindelvald \nkilled many people, my grandfather, for instance. Of course, he vos never powerful in \nthis country, they said he feared Dumbledore \u2013 and rightly, seeing how he vos finished. \nBut this\u201d \u2013 he pointed a finger at Xenophilius \u2013 \u201cthis is his symbol, I recognized it at \nvunce: Grindelvald carved it into a vall at Durmstrang ver he vos a pupil there. Some \nidiots copied it onto their books and clothes thinking to shock, make themselves \nimpressive \u2013 until those of us who had lost family members to Grindelvald taught them \nbetter.\u201d \n\n Krum cracked his knuckles menacingly and glowered at Xenophilius. Harry felt \nperplexed. It seemed incredibly unlikely that Luna\u2019s father was a supporter of the Dark \nArts, and nobody else in the tent seemed to have recognized the triangular, finlike shape. \n\n\f\n \u201cAre you \u2013 er \u2013 quite sure it\u2019s Grindelwald\u2019s -?\u201d \n\n \u201cI am not mistaken,\u201d said Krum coldly. \u201cI walked past that sign for several years, \nI know it vell.\u201d \n\n \u201cWell, there\u2019s a chance,\u201d said Harry, \u201cthat Xenophilius doesn\u2019t actually know \nwhat the symbol means, the Lovegoods are quite\u2026 unusual. He could have easily picked \nit up somewhere and think it\u2019s a cross section of the head of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack \nor something.\u201d \n\n \u201cThe cross section of a vot?\u201d \n\n \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know what they are, but apparently he and his daughter go on \nholiday looking for them\u2026.\u201d \n\n Harry felt he was doing a bad job explaining Luna and her father. \n\n \u201cThat\u2019s her,\u201d he said, pointing at Luna, who was still dancing alone, waving her \narms around her head like someone attempting to beat off midges. \n\n \u201cVy is she doing that?\u201d asked Krum. \n\n \u201cProbably trying to get rid of a Wrackspurt,\u201d said Harry, who recognized the \nsymptoms. \n\n Krum did not seem to know whether or not Harry was making fun of him. He \ndrew his hand from inside his robe and tapped it menacingly on his thighs; sparks flew \nout of the end. \n\n \u201cGregorovitch!\u201d said Harry loudly, and Krum started, but Harry was too excited \nto care; the memory had come back to him at the sight of Krum\u2019s wand: Ollivander \ntaking it and examining it carefully before the Triwizard Tournament. \n\n \u201cVot about him?\u201d asked Krum suspiciously. \n\n \u201cHe\u2019s a wandmaker!\u201d \n\n \u201cI know that,\u201d said Krum. \n\n \u201cHe made your wand! That\u2019s why I thought \u2013 Quidditch \u2013\u201c \n\n Krum was looking more and more suspicious. \n\n \u201cHow do you know Gregorovitch made my wand?\u201d \n\n \u201cI\u2026I read it somewhere, I think,\u201d said Harry. \u201cIn a \u2013 a fan magazine,\u201d he \nimprovised wildly and Krum looked mollified. \n\n \u201cI had not realized I ever discussed my vand with fans,\u201d he said. \n\n \u201cSo\u2026 er\u2026 where is Gregorowitch these days?\u201d \n\n Krum looked puzzled. \n\n \u201cHe retired several years ago. I was one of the last to purchase a Gregorovitch \nvand. They are the best \u2013although I know, of course, that your Britons set much store by \nOllivander.\u201d \n\n Harry did not answer. He pretended to watch the dancers, like Krum, but he was \nthinking hard. So Voldemort was looking for a celebrated wandmaker and Harry did not \nhave to search far for a reason. It was surely because of what Harry\u2019 wand had done on \nthe night that Voldemort pursued him across the skies. The holly and phoenix feather \nwand had conquered the borrowed wand, some thing that Ollivander had not anticipated \nor understood. Would Gregorowitch know better? Was he truly more skilled than \nOllivander, did he know secrets of wands that Ollivander did not? \n\n \u201cThis girl is very nice-looking,\u201d Krum said, recalling Harry to his surroundings. \nKrum was pointing at Ginny, who had just joined Luna. \u201cShe is also a relative of yours?\u201d \n\n\f\n \u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry, suddenly irritated, \u201cand she\u2019s seeing someone. Jealous type. \nBig bloke. You wouldn\u2019t want to cross him.\u201d \n\n Krum grunted. \n\n \u201cVot,\u201d he said, draining his goblet and getting to his feet again, \u201cis the point of \nbeing an international Quidditch player if all the good-looking girls are taken?\u201d \n\n And he strode off leaving Harry to take a sandwich from a passing waiter and \nmake his way around the edge of the crowded dance floor. He wanted to find Ron, to tell \nhim about Gregorovitch, but he was dancing with Hermione out in the middle of the floor. \nHarry leaned up against one of the golden pillars and watched Ginny, who was now \ndancing with Fred and George\u2019s friend Lee Jordan, trying not to feel resentful about the \npromise he had given Ron. \n\n He had never been to a wedding before, so he could not judge how Wizarding \ncelebrations differed from Muggle ones, though he was pretty sure that the latter would \nnot involve a wedding cake topped with two model phoenixes that took flight when the \ncake was cut, or bottles of champagne that floated unsupported through the crowd. As \nthe evening drew in, and moths began to swoop under the canopy, now lit with floating \ngolden lanterns, the revelry became more and more uncontained. Fred and George had \nlong since disappeared into the darkness with a pair of Fleur\u2019s cousins; Charlie, Hagrid, \nand a squat wizard in a purple porkpie hat were singing \u201cOdo the Hero\u201d in the corner. \n\n Wandering through the crowd so as to escape a drunken uncle of Ron\u2019s who \nseemed unsure whether or not Harry was his son, Harry spotted an old wizard sitting \nalone at a table. His cloud of white hair made him look rather like an aged dandelion \nclock and was topped by a moth-eaten fez. He was vaguely familiar: Racking his brains, \nHarry suddenly realized that this was Elphias Doge, member of the Order of the Phoenix \nand the writer of Dumbledore\u2019s obituary. \n\n Harry approached him. \n\n \u201cMay I sit down?\u201d \n\n \u201cOf course, of course,\u201d said Doge; he had a rather high-pitched, wheezy voice. \n\n Harry leaned in. \n\n \u201cMr. Doge, I\u2019m Harry Potter.\u201d \n\n Doge gasped. \n\n \u201cMy dear boy! Arthur told me you were here, disguised\u2026. I am so glad, so \nhonored!\u201d \n\n In a flutter of nervous pleasure Doge poured Harry a goblet of champagne. \n\n \u201cI thought of writing to you,\u201d he whispered, \u201cafter Dumbledore\u2026 the shock\u2026 \nand for you, I am sure\u2026\u201d \n\n Doge\u2019s tiny eyes filled with sudden tears. \n\n \u201cI saw the obituary you wrote for the Daily Prophet,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize \nyou knew Professor Dumbledore so well.\u201d \n\n \u201cAs well as anyone,\u201d said Doge, dabbing his eyes with a napkin. \u201cCertainly I \nknew him longest, if you don\u2019t count Aberforth \u2013 and somehow, people never do seem to \ncount Aberforth.\u201d \n\n \u201cSpeaking of the Daily Prophet\u2026 I don\u2019t know whether you saw, Mr. Doge -?\u201d \n\n \u201cOh, please call me Elphias, dear boy.\u201d \n\n \u201cElphias, I don\u2019t know whether you saw the interview Rita Skeeter gave about \nDumbledore?\u201d \n\n\f\n Doge\u2019s face flooded with angry color. \n\n \u201cOh yes, Harry, I saw it. That woman, or vulture might be a more accurate term, \npositively pestered me to talk to her, I am ashamed to say that I became rather rude, \ncalled her an interfering trout, which resulted, as you my have seen, in aspersions cast \nupon my sanity.\u201d \n\n \u201cWell, in that interview,\u201d Harry went on, \u201cRita Skeeter hinted that Professor \nDumbledore was involved in the Dark Arts when he was young.\u201d \n\n \u201cDon\u2019t believe a word of it!\u201d said Doge at once. \u201cNot a word, Harry! Let nothing \ntarnish your memories of Albus Dumbledore!\u201d \n\n Harry looked into Doge\u2019s earnest, pained face, and felt, not reassured, but \nfrustrated. Did Doge really think it was that easy, that Harry could simply choose not to \nbelieve? Didn\u2019t Doge understand Harry\u2019s need to be sure, to know everything?\u201d \n\n Perhaps Doge suspected Harry\u2019s feelings, for he looked concerned and hurried on, \n\u201cHarry, Rita Skeeter is a dreadful \u2013\u201c \n\n But he was interrupted by a shrill cackle. \n\n \u201cRita Skeeter? Oh, I love her, always read her!\u201d \n\n Harry and Doge looked up to see Auntie Muriel standing there, the plumes \ndancing on her hair, a goblet of champagne in her hand. \u201cShe\u2019s written a book about \nDumbledore, you know!\u201d \n\n\u201cHello, Muriel,\u201d said Doge, \u201cYes, we were just discussing \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cYou there! Give me your chair, I\u2019m a hundred and seven!\u201d \n\n Another redheaded Weasley cousin jumped off his seat, looking alarmed, and \nAuntie Muriel swung it around with surprising strength and plopped herself down upon it \nbetween Doge and Harry. \n\n \u201cHello again, Barry or whatever your name is,\u201d she said to Harry, \u201cNow what \nwere you saying about Rita Skeeter, Elphias? You know, she\u2019s written a biography of \nDumbledore? I can\u2019t wait to read it. I must remember to place an order at Flourish and \nBlotts!\u201d \n\n Doge looked stiff and solemn at this but Auntie Muriel drained her goblet and \nclicked her bony fingers at a passing waiter for a replacement. She took another large \ngulp of champagne, belched and then said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to look like a pair of stuffed \nfrogs! Before he became so respected and respectable and all that tosh, there were some \nmighty funny rumors about Albus!\u201d \n\n \u201cIll-informed sniping,\u201d said Doge, turning radish-colored again. \n\n \u201cYou would say that, Elphias,\u201d cackled Auntie Muriel. \u201cI noticed how you skated \nover the sticky patches in that obituary of yours!\u201d \n\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry you think so,\u201d said Doge, more coldly still. \u201cI assure you I was writing \nfrom the heart.\u201d \n\n \u201cOh, we all know you worshipped Dumbledore; I daresay you\u2019ll still think he was \na saint even if it does turn out that he did away with his Squib sister!\u201d \n\n \u201cMuriel!\u201d exclaimed Doge. \n\n A chill that had nothing to do with the iced champagne was stealing through \nHarry\u2019s chest. \n\n \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he asked Muriel. \u201cWho said his sister was a Squib? I \nthought she was ill?\u201d \n\n\f\n \u201cThought wrong, then, didn\u2019t you, Barry!\u201d said Auntie Muriel, looking delighted \nat the effect she had produced. \u201cAnyway, how could you expect to know anything about \nit! IT all happened years and years before you were even thought of, my dear, and the \ntruth is that those of us who were alive then never knew what really happened. That\u2019s \nwhy I can\u2019t wait to find out what Skeeter\u2019s unearthed! Dumbledore kept that sister of his \nquiet for a long time!\u201d \n\n \u201cUntrue!\u201d wheezed Doge, \u201cAbsolutely untrue!\u201d \n\n \u201cHe never told me his sister as a Squib,\u201d said Harry, without thinking, still cold \ninside. \n\n \u201cAnd why on earth would he tell you?\u201d screeched Muriel, swaying a little in her \nseat as she attempted to focus upon Harry. \n\n \u201cThe reason Albus never spoke about Ariana,\u201d began Elphias in a voice stiff with \nemotion, \u201cis, I should have thought, quite clear. He was so devastated by her death \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cWhy did nobody ever see her, Elphias?\u201d squawked Muriel, \u201cWhy did half of us \nnever even know she existed, until they carried the coffin out of the house and held a \nfuneral for her? Where was saintly Albus while Ariana was locked in the cellar? Off \nbeing brilliant at Hogwarts, and never mind what was going on in his own house!\u201d \n\n \u201cWhat d\u2019you mean, locked in the cellar?\u201d asked Harry. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d \n\n Doge looked wretched. Auntie Muriel cackled again and answered Harry. \n\n \u201cDumbledore\u2019s mother was a terrifying woman, simply terrifying. Muggle-born, \nthough I heard she pretended otherwise-\u201c \n\n \u201cShe never pretended anything of the sort! Kendra was a fine woman,\u201d whispered \nDoge miserably, but Auntie Muriel ignored him. \n\n \u201c- proud and very domineering, the sort of witch who would have been mortified \nto produce a Squib-\u201c \n\n \u201cAriana was not a Squib!\u201d wheezed Doge. \n\n \u201cSo you say, Elphias, but explain, then, why she never attended Hogwarts!\u201d said \nAuntie Muriel. She turned back to Harry. \u201cIn our day, Squibs were often hushed up, \nthought to take it to the extreme of actually imprisoning a little girl in the house and \npretending she didn\u2019t exist \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cI tell you, that\u2019s not what happened!\u201d said Doge, but Auntie Muriel \nsteamrollered on, still addressing Harry. \n\n Squibs were usually shipped off to Muggle schools and encouraged to integrate \ninto the Muggle community\u2026 much kinder than trying to find them a place in the \nWizarding world, where they must always be second class, but naturally Kendra \nDumbledore wouldn\u2019t have dreamed of letting her daughter go to a Muggle school \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cAriana was delicate!\u201d said Doge desperately. \u201cHer health was always too poor to \npermit her \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201c- to permit her to leave the house?\u201d cackled Muriel. \u201cAnd yet she was never \ntaken to St. Mungo\u2019s and no Healer was ever summoned to see her!\u201d \n\n \u201cReally, Muriel, how can you possibly know whether \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cFor your information, Elphias, my cousin Lancelot was a Healer at St. Mungo\u2019s \nat the time, and he told my family in strictest confidence that Ariana had never been seen \nthere. All most suspicious, Lancelot thought!\u201d \n\n Doge looked to be on the verge of tears. Auntie Muriel, who seemed to be \nenjoying herself hugely, snapped her fingers for more champagne. Numbly Harry \n\n\f\nthought of how the Dursleys had once shut him up, locked him away, kept him out of \nsight, all for the crime of being a wizard. Had Dumbledore\u2019s sister suffered the same fate \nin reverse: imprisoned for her lack of magic? And had Dumbledore truly left her to her \nfate while he went off to Hogwarts to prove himself brilliant and talented? \n\n \u201cNow, if Kendra hadn\u2019t died first,\u201d Muriel resumed, \u201cI\u2019d have said that it was she \nwho finished off Ariana \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cHow can you, Muriel!\u201d groaned Doge. \u201cA mother kill her own daughter? Think \nwhat you\u2019re saying!\u201d \n\n \u201cIf the mother in question was capable of imprisoning her daughter for years on \nend, why not?\u201d shrugged Auntie Muriel. \u201cBut as I say, it doesn\u2019t fit, because Kendra died \nbefore Ariana \u2013 of what, nobody ever seemed sure-\u201c \n\n \u201cYes, Ariana might have made a desperate bid for freedom and killed Kendra in \nthe struggle,\u201d said Auntie Muriel thoughtfully. \u201cShake your head all you like, Elphias. \nYou were at Ariana\u2019s funeral, were you not?\u201d \n\n \u201cYes I was,\u201d said Doge, through trembling lips,\u201d and a more desperately sad \noccasion I cannot remember. Albus was heartbroken-\u201c \n\n \u201cHis heart wasn\u2019t the only thing. Didn\u2019t Aberforth break Albus\u2019 nose halfway \nthrough the service?\u201d \n\n If Doge had looked horrified before this, it was nothing to how he looked now. \nMuriel might have stabbed him. She cackled loudly and took another swig of champagne, \nwhich dribbled down her chin. \n\n \u201cHow do you -?\u201d croaked Doge. \n\n \u201cMy mother was friendly with old Bathilda Bagshot,\u201d said Auntie Muriel happily. \n\u201cBathilda described the whole thing to mother while I was listening at the door. A \ncoffin-side brawl. The way Bathilda told it, Aberforth shouted that it was all Albus\u2019 fault \nthat Ariana was dead and then punched him in the face. According to Bathilda, Albus did \nnot even defend himself, and that\u2019s odd enough in itself. Albus could have destroyed \nAberforth in a duel with both hands tied behind his back. \n\n Muriel swigged yet more champagne. The recitation of those old scandals \nseemed to elate her as much as they horrified Doge. Harry did not know what to think, \nwhat to believe. He wanted the truth and yet all Doge did was sit there and bleat feebly \nthat Ariana had been ill. Harry could hardly believe that Dumbledore would not have \nintervened if such cruelty was happening inside his own house, and yet there was \nundoubtedly something odd about the story. \n\n \u201cAnd I\u2019ll tell you something else,\u201d Muriel said, hiccupping slightly as she lowered \nher goblet. \u201cI think Bathilda has spilled the beans to Rita Skeeter. All those hints in \nSkeeter\u2019s interview about an important source close to the Dumbledores \u2013 goodness \nknows she was there all through the Ariana business, and it would fit!\u201d \n\n \u201cBathilda, would never talk to Rita Skeeter!\u201d whispered Doge. \n\n \u201cBathilda Bagshot?\u201d Harry said. \u201cThe author of A History of Magic?\u201d \n\n The name was printed on the front of one of Harry\u2019s textbooks, though admittedly \nnot one of the ones he had read more attentively. \n\n \u201cYes,\u201d said Doge, clutching at Harry\u2019s question like a drowning man at a life heir. \n\u201cA most gifted magical historian and an old friend of Albus\u2019s.\u201d \n\n \u201cQuite gaga these days, I\u2019ve heard,\u201d said Auntie Muriel cheerfully. \n\n\f\n \u201cIf that is so, it is even more dishonorable for Skeeter to have taken advantage of \nher,\u201d said Doge, \u201cand no reliance can be placed on anything Bathilda may have said!\u201d \n\n \u201cOh, there are ways of bringing back memories, and I\u2019m sure Rita Skeeter knows \nthem all,\u201d said Auntie Muriel \u201cBut even if Bathilda\u2019s completely cuckoo, I\u2019m sure she\u2019d \nstill have old photographs, maybe even letters. She knew the Dumbledores for years\u2026. \nWell worth a trip to Godric\u2019s Hollow, I\u2019d have thought.\u201d \n\n Harry, who had been taking a sip of butterbeer, choked. Doge banged him on the \nback as Harry coughed, looking at Auntie Muriel through streaming eyes. Once he had \ncontrol of his voice again, he asked, \u201cBathilda Bagshot lives in Godric\u2019s Hollow?\u201d \n\n \u201cOh yes, she\u2019s been there forever! The Dumbledores moved there after Percival \nwas imprisoned, and she was their neighbor.\u201d \n\n \u201cThe Dumbledores lived in Godric\u2019s Hollows?\u201d \n\n \u201cYes, Barry, that\u2019s what I just said,\u201d said Auntie Muriel testily. \n\n Harry felt drained, empty. Never once, in six years, had Dumbledore told Harry \nthat they had both lived and lost loved ones in Godric\u2019s Hollow. Why? Were Lily and \nJames buried close to Dumbledore\u2019s mother and sister? Had Dumbledore visited their \ngraves, perhaps walked past Lily\u2019s and James\u2019s to do so? And he had never once told \nHarry \u2026 never bothered to say\u2026 \n\n And why it was so important, Harry could not explain even to himself, yet he felt \nit had been tantamount to a lie not to tell him that they had this place and these \nexperiences in common. He stared ahead of him, barely noticing what was going on \naround him, and did not realize that Hermione had appeared out of the crowd until she \ndrew up a chair beside him. \n\n \u201cI simply can\u2019t dance anymore,\u201d she panted, slipping of one of her shoes and \nrubbing the sole of her foot. \u201cRon\u2019s gone looking to find more butterbeers. It\u2019s a bit odd. \nI\u2019ve just seen Viktor storming away from Luna\u2019s father, it looked like they\u2019d been \narguing \u2013\u201c She dropped her voice, staring at him. \u201cHarry, are you okay?\u201d \n\n Harry did not know where to begin, but it did not matter, at that moment, \nsomething large and silver came falling through the canopy over the dance floor. \nGraceful and gleaming, the lynx landed lightly in the middle of the astonished dancers. \nHeads turned, as those nearest it froze absurdly in mid-dance. Then the Patronus\u2019s mouth \nopened wide and it spoke in the loud, deep, slow voice of Kingsley Shacklebolt. \n\n \u201cThe Ministry has fallen. Scrimgeour is dead. They are coming.\u201d \n\nChapter Nine \n\nA Place to Hide \n\n \n\nEverything seemed fuzzy, slow. Harry and Hermione jumped to their feet and \ndrew their wands. Many people were only just realizing that something strange had \nhappened; heads were still turning toward the silver cat as it vanished. Silence spread \noutward in cold ripples from the place where the Patronus had landed. Then somebody \nscreamed. \n\n Harry and Hermione threw themselves into the panicking crowd. Guests were \nsprinting in all directions; many were Disapparating; the protective enchantments around \nthe Burrow had broken. \n\n\f\n \u201cRon!\u201d Hermione cried. \u201cRon, where are you?\u201d \n\n As they pushed their way across the dance floor, Harry saw cloaked and masked \nfigures appearing in the crowd; then he saw Lupin and Tonks, their wands raised, and \nheard both of them shout, \u201cProtego!\u201d, a cry that was echoed on all sides \u2013 \n\n \u201cRon! Ron!\u201d Hermione called, half sobbing as she and Harry were buffered by \nterrified guests: Harry seized her hand to make sure they weren\u2019t separated as a streak of \nlight whizzed over their heads, whether a protective charm or something more sinister he \ndid not know \u2013 \n\n And then Ron was there. He caught hold of Hermione\u2019s free arm, and Harry felt \nher turn on the spot; sight and sound were extinguished as darkness pressed in upon him; \nall he could feel was Hermione\u2019s hand as he was squeezed through space and time, away \nfrom the Burrow, away from the descending Death Eaters, away, perhaps, from \nVoldemort himself. . . . \n\n \u201cWhere are we?\u201d said Ron\u2019s voice. \n\n Harry opened his eyes. For a moment he thought they had not left the wedding \nafter all; They still seemed to be surrounded by people. \n\n \u201cTottenham Court Road,\u201d panted Hermione. \u201cWalk, just walk, we need to find \nsomewhere for you to change.\u201d \n\n Harry did as she asked. They half walked, half ran up the wide dark street \nthronged with late-night revelers and lined with closed shops, stars twinkling above them. \nA double-decker bus rumbled by and a group of merry pub-goers ogled them as they \npassed; Harry and Ron were still wearing dress robes. \n\n \u201cHermione, we haven\u2019t got anything to change into,\u201d Ron told her, as a young \nwoman burst into raucous giggles at the sight of him. \n\n \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I make sure I had the Invisibility Cloak with me?\u201d said Harry, \ninwardly cursing his own stupidity. \u201cAll last year I kept it on me and \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019ve got the Cloak, I\u2019ve got clothes for both of you,\u201d said Hermione, \n\u201cJust try and act naturally until \u2013 this will do.\u201d \n\n She led them down a side street, then into the shelter of a shadowy alleyway. \n\n \u201cWhen you say you\u2019ve got the Cloak, and clothes . . .\u201d said Harry, frowning at \nHermione, who was carrying nothing except her small beaded handbag, in which she was \nnow rummaging. \n\n \u201cYes, they\u2019re here,\u201d said Hermione, and to Harry and Ron\u2019s utter astonishment, \nshe pulled out a pair of jeans, a sweatshirt, some maroon socks, and finally the silvery \nInvisibility Cloak. \n\n \u201cHow the ruddy hell \u2013 ?\u201d \n\n \u201cUndetectable Extension Charm,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cTricky, but I think I\u2019ve done it \nokay; anyway, I managed to fit everything we need in here.\u201d She gave the fragile-looking \nbag a little shake and it echoed like a cargo hold as a number of heavy objects rolled \naround inside it. \u201cOh, damn, that\u2019ll be the books,\u201d she said, peering into it, \u201cand I had \nthem all stacked by subject. . . . Oh well. . . . Harry, you\u2019d better take the Invisibility \nCloak. Ron, hurry up and change. . . .\u201d \n\n \u201cWhen did you do all this?\u201d Harry asked as Ron stripped off his robes. \n\n \u201cI told you at the Burrow, I\u2019ve had the essentials packed for days, you know, in \ncase we needed to make a quick getaway. I packed your rucksack this morning, Harry, \nafter you changed, and put it in here. . . . I just had a feeling. . . .\u201d \n\n\f\n \u201cYou\u2019re amazing, you are,\u201d said Ron, handing her his bundled-up robes. \n\n \u201cThank you,\u201d said Hermione, managing a small smile as she pushed the robes into \nthe bag. \u201cPlease, Harry, get that Cloak on!\u201d \n\n Harry threw his Invisibility Cloak around his shoulders and pulled it up over his \nhead, vanishing from sight. He was only just beginning to appreciate what had happened. \n\n \u201cThe others \u2013 everybody at the wedding \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cWe can\u2019t worry about that now,\u201d whispered Hermione. \u201cIt\u2019s you they\u2019re after, \nHarry, and we\u2019ll just put everyone in even more danger by going back.\u201d \n\n \u201cShe\u2019s right,\u201d said Ron, who seemed to know that Harry was about to argue, even \nif he could not see his face. \u201cMost of the Order was there, they\u2019ll look after everyone.\u201d \n\n Harry nodded, then remembered that they could not see him, and said, \u201cYeah.\u201d \nBut he thought of Ginny, and fear bubbled like acid in his stomach. \n\n \u201cCome on, I think we ought to keep moving,\u201d said Hermione. \n\n They moved back up the side street and onto the main road again, where a group \nof men on the opposite side was singing and weaving across the pavement. \n\n \u201cJust as a matter of interest, why Tottenham Court Road?\u201d Ron asked Hermione. \n\n \u201cI\u2019ve no idea, it just popped into my head, but I\u2019m sure we\u2019re safer out in the \nMuggle world, it\u2019s not where they\u2019ll expect us to be.\u201d \n\n \u201cTrue,\u201d said Ron, looking around, \u201cbut don\u2019t you feel a bit \u2013 exposed?\u201d \n\n \u201cWhere else is there?\u201d asked Hermione, cringing as the men on the other side of \nthe road started wolf-whistling at her. \u201cWe can hardly book rooms at the Leaky Cauldron, \ncan we? And Grimmauld Place is out if Snape can get in there. . . . I suppose we could try \nmy parents\u2019 home, though I think there\u2019s a chance they might check there. . . . Oh, I wish \nthey\u2019d shut up!\u201d \n\n \u201cAll right, darling?\u201d the drunkest of the men on the other pavement was yelling. \n\u201cFancy a drink? Ditch ginger and come and have a pint!\u201d \n\n \u201cLet\u2019s sit down somewhere,\u201d Hermione said hastily as Ron opened his mouth to \nshout back across the road. \u201cLook, this will do, in here!\u201d \n\n It was a small and shabby all-night caf\u00e9. A light layer of grease lay on all the \nFormica-topped tables, but it was at least empty. Harry slipped into a booth first and Ron \nsat next to him opposite Hermione, who had her back to the entrance and did not like it: \nShe glanced over her shoulder so frequently she appeared to have a twitch. Harry did not \nlike being stationary; walking had given the illusion that they had a goal. Beneath the \nCloak he could feel the last vestiges of Polyjuice leaving him, his hands returning to their \nusual length and shape. He pulled his glasses out of his pocket and put them on again. \n\n After a minute or two, Ron said, \u201cYou know, we\u2019re not far from the Leaky \nCauldron here, it\u2019s only in Charing Cross \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cRon, we can\u2019t!\u201d said Hermione at once. \n\n \u201cNot to stay there, but to find out what\u2019s going on!\u201d \n\n \u201cWe know what\u2019s going on! Voldemort\u2019s taken over the Ministry, what else do \nwe need to know?\u201d \n\n \u201cOkay, okay, it was just an idea!\u201d \nThey relapsed into a prickly silence. The gum-chewing waitress shuffled over and \nHermione ordered two cappuccinos: As Harry was invisible, it would have looked odd to \norder him one. A pair of burly workmen entered the caf\u00e9 and squeezed into the next \nbooth. Hermione dropped her voice to a whisper. \n\n\f\n \u201cI say we find a quiet place to Disapparate and head for the countryside. Once \nwe\u2019re there, we could send a message to the Order.\u201d \n\n \u201cCan you do that talking Patronus thing, then?\u201d asked Ron. \n\n \u201cI\u2019ve been practicing and I think so,\u201d said Hermione. \n\n \u201cWell, as long as it doesn\u2019t get them into trouble, though they might\u2019ve been \narrested already. God, that\u2019s revolting,\u201d Ron added after one sip of the foamy, grayish \ncoffee. The waitress had heard; she shot Ron a nasty look as she shuffled off to take the \nnew customers\u2019 orders. The larger of the two workmen, who was blond and quite huge, \nnow that Harry came to look at him, waved her away. She stared, affronted. \n\n \u201cLet\u2019s get going, then, I don\u2019t want to drink this muck,\u201d said Ron. \u201cHermione, \nhave you got Muggle money to pay for this?\u201d \n\n \u201cYes, I took out all my Building Society savings before I came to the Burrow. I\u2019ll \nbet all the change is at the bottom,\u201d sighed Hermione, reaching for her beaded bag. \n\n The two workmen made identical movements, and Harry mirrored them without \nconscious thought: All three of them drew their wands. Ron, a few seconds late in \nrealizing what was going on, lunged across the table, pushing Hermione sideways onto \nher bench. The force of the Death Eaters\u2019 spells shattered the tiled wall where Ron\u2019s head \nhad just been, as Harry, still invisible, yelled, \u201cStupefy!\u201d \n\n The great blond Death Eater was hit in the face by a jet of red light: He slumped \nsideways, unconscious. His companion, unable to see who had cast the spell, fired \nanother at Ron: Shining black ropes flew from his wand-tip and bound Ron head to foot \u2013 \nthe waitress screamed and ran for the door \u2013 Harry sent another Stunning Spell at the \nDeath Eater with the twisted face who had tied up Ron, but the spell missed, rebounded \non the window, and hit the waitress, who collapsed in front of the door. \n\n \u201cExpulso!\u201d bellowed the Death Eater, and the table behind which Harry was \nstanding blew up: The force of the explosion slammed him into the wall and he felt his \nwand leave his hand as the Cloak slipped off him. \n\n \u201cPetrificus Totalus!\u201d screamed Hermione from out of sight, and the Death Eater \nfell forward like a statue to land with a crunching thud on the mess of broken china, table, \nand coffee. Hermione crawled out from underneath the bench, shaking bits of glass \nashtray out of her hair and trembling all over. \n\n \u201cD-diffindo,\u201d she said, pointing her wand at Ron, who roared in pain as she \nslashed open the knee of his jeans, leaving a deep cut. \u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry, Ron, my hand\u2019s \nshaking! Diffindo!\u201d \n\n The severed ropes fell away. Ron got to his feet, shaking his arms to regain \nfeeling in them. Harry picked up his wand and climbed over all the debris to where the \nlarge blond Death Eater was sprawled across the bench. \n\n \u201cI should\u2019ve recognized him, he was there the night Dumbledore died,\u201d he said. \nHe turned over the darker Death Eater with his foot; the man\u2019s eyes moved rapidly \nbetween Harry, Ron and Hermione. \n\n \u201cThat\u2019s Dolohov,\u201d said Ron. \u201cI recognize him from the old wanted posters. I think \nthe big one\u2019s Thorfinn Rowle.\u201d \n\n \u201cNever mind what they\u2019re called!\u201d said Hermione a little hysterically. \u201cHow did \nthey find us? What are we going to do?\u201d \n\n Somehow her panic seemed to clear Harry\u2019s head. \n\n \u201cLock the door,\u201d he told her, \u201cand Ron, turn out the lights.\u201d \n\n\f\n He looked down at the paralyzed Dolohov, thinking fast as the lock clicked and \nRon used the Deluminator to plunge the caf\u00e9 into darkness. Harry could hear the men \nwho had jeered at Hermione earlier, yelling at another girl in the distance. \n\n \u201cWhat are we going to do with them?\u201d Ron whispered to Harry through the dark; \nthen, even more quietly, \u201cKill them? They\u2019d kill us. They had a good go just now.\u201d \n\n Hermione shuddered and took a step backward. Harry shook his head. \n\n \u201cWe just need to wipe their memories,\u201d said Harry. \u201cIt\u2019s better like that, it\u2019ll \nthrow them off the scent. If we killed them it\u2019d be obvious we were here.\u201d \n\n \u201cYou\u2019re the boss,\u201d said Ron, sounding profoundly relieved. \u201cBut I\u2019ve never down \na Memory Charm.\u201d \n\n \u201cNor have I,\u201d said Hermione, \u201cbut I know the theory.\u201d \n\n She took a deep, calming breath, then pointed her wand at Dolohov\u2019s forehead \nand said, \u201cObliviate.\u201d \n\n At once, Dolohov\u2019s eyes became unfocused and dreamy. \n\n \u201cBrilliant!\u201d said Harry, clapping her on the back. \u201cTake care of the other one and \nthe waitress while Ron and I clear up.\u201d \n\u201cClear up?\u201d said Ron, looking around at the partly destroyed caf\u00e9. \u201cWhy?\u201d \n\n \u201cDon\u2019t you think they might wonder what\u2019s happened if they wake up and find \nthemselves in a place that looks like it\u2019s just been bombed?\u201d \n\n \u201cOh right, yeah . . .\u201d \n\n Ron struggled for a moment before managing to extract his wand from his pocket. \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder I can\u2019t get it out, Hermione, you packed my old jeans, they\u2019re \ntight.\u201d \n\n \u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d hissed Hermione, and as she dragged the waitress out of sight \nof the windows, Harry heard her mutter a suggestion as to where Ron could stick his \nwand instead. \n\n Once the caf\u00e9 was restored to its previous condition, they heaved the Death Eaters \nback into their booth and propped them up facing each other. \u201cBut how did they find us?\u201d \nHermione asked, looking from one inert man to the other. \u201cHow did they know where we \nwere?\u201d \n\n She turned to Harry. \n\n \u201cYou \u2013 you don\u2019t think you\u2019ve still got your Trace on you, do you, Harry?\u201d \n\n \u201cHe can\u2019t have,\u201d said Ron. \u201cThe Trace breaks at seventeen, that\u2019s Wizarding law, \nyou can\u2019t put it on an adult.\u201d \n\n \u201cAs far as you know,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cWhat if the Death Eaters have found a \nway to put it on a seventeen-year-old?\u201d \n\n \u201cBut Harry hasn\u2019t been near a Death Eater in the last twenty-four hours. Who\u2019s \nsupposed to have put a Trace back on him?\u201d \n\n Hermione did not reply. Harry felt contaminated, tainted: Was that really how the \nDeath Eaters had found them? \n\n \u201cIf I can\u2019t use magic, and you can\u2019t use magic near me, without us giving away \nour position \u2013 \u201c he began. \n\n \u201cWe\u2019re not splitting up!\u201d said Hermione firmly. \n\n \u201cWe need a safe place to hide,\u201d said Ron. \u201cGive us time to think things through.\u201d \n\n \u201cGrimmauld Place,\u201d said Harry. \n\n The other two gaped. \n\n\f\n \u201cDon\u2019t be silly, Harry, Snape can get in there!\u201d \n\n \u201cRon\u2019s dad said they\u2019ve put up jinxes against him \u2013 and even if they haven\u2019t \nworked,\u201d he pressed on as Hermione began to argue \u201cso what? I swear, I\u2019d like nothing \nbetter than to meet Snape!\u201d \n\n \u201cBut \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cHermione, where else is there? It\u2019s the best chance we\u2019ve got. Snape\u2019s only one \nDeath Eater. If I\u2019ve still got the Trace on me, we\u2019ll have whole crowds of them on us \nwherever else we go.\u201d \n\n She could not argue, though she looked as if she would have liked to. While she \nunlocked the caf\u00e9 door, Ron clicked the Deluminator to release the caf\u00e9\u2019s light. Then, on \nHarry\u2019s count of three, they reversed the spells upon their three victims, and before the \nwaitress or either of the Death Eaters could do more than stir sleepily, Harry, Ron and \nHermione had turned on the spot and vanished into the compressing darkness once more. \n\n Seconds later Harry\u2019s lungs expanded gratefully and he opened his eyes: They \nwere now standing in the middle of a familiar small and shabby square. Tall, dilapidated \nhouses looked down on them from every side. Number twelve was visible to them, for \nthey had been told of its existence by Dumbledore, its Secret-Keeper, and they rushed \ntoward it, checking every few yards that they were not being followed or observed. They \nraced up the stone steps, and Harry tapped the front door once with his wand. They heard \na series of metallic clicks and the clatter of a chain, then the door swung open with a \ncreak and they hurried over the threshold. \n\n As Harry closed the door behind them, the old-fashioned gas lamps sprang into \nlife, casting flickering light along the length of the hallway. It looked just as Harry \nremembered it: eerie, cobwebbed, the outlines of the house-elf heads on the wall \nthrowing odd shadows up the staircase. Long dark curtains concealed the portrait of \nSirius\u2019s mother. The only thing that was out of place was the troll\u2019s leg umbrella stand, \nwhich was lying on its side as if Tonks had just knocked it over again. \n\n \u201cI think somebody\u2019s been in here,\u201d Hermione whispered, pointing toward it. \n\n \u201cThat could\u2019ve happened as the Order left,\u201d Ron murmured back. \n\n \u201cSo where are these jinxes they put up against Snape?\u201d Harry asked. \n\n \u201cMaybe they\u2019re only activated if he shows up?\u201d suggested Ron. \n\n Yet they remained close together on the doormat, backs against the door, scared \nto move farther into the house. \n\n \u201cWell, we can\u2019t stay here forever,\u201d said Harry, and he took a step forward. \n\n \u201cSeverus Snape?\u201d \n\n Mad-Eye Moody\u2019s voice whispered out of the darkness, making all three of them \njump back in fright. \u201cWe\u2019re not Snape!\u201d croaked Harry, before something whooshed over \nhim like cold air and his tongue curled backward on itself, making it impossible to speak. \nBefore he had time to feel inside his mouth, however, his tongue had unraveled again. \n\n The other two seemed to have experienced the same unpleasant sensation. Ron \nwas making retching noises; Hermione stammered, \u201cThat m-must have b-been the T-\nTongue-Tying Curse Mad-Eye set up for Snape!\u201d \n\n Gingerly Harry took another step forward. Something shifted in the shadows at \nthe end of the hall, and before any of them could say another word, a figure had risen up \nout of the carpet, tall, dust-colored, and terrible; Hermione screamed and so did Mrs. \nBlack, her curtains flying open; the gray figure was gliding toward them, faster and faster, \n\n\f\nits waist-length hair and beard streaming behind it, its face sunken, fleshless, with empty \neye sockets: Horribly familiar, dreadfully altered, it raised a wasted arm, pointing at \nHarry. \n\n \u201cNo!\u201d Harry shouted, and though he had raised his wand no spell occurred to him. \n\u201cNo! It wasn\u2019t us! We didn\u2019t kill you \u2013\u201c \n\n On the word kill, the figure exploded in a great cloud of dust: Coughing, his eyes \nwatering, Harry looked around to see Hermione crouched on the floor by the door with \nher arms over her head, and Ron, who was shaking from head to foot, patting her \nclumsily on the shoulder and saying, \u201cIt\u2019s all r-right. . . . It\u2019s g-gone. . . .\u201d \n\n Dust swirled around Harry like mist, catching the blue gaslight, as Mrs. Black \ncontinued to scream. \n\n \u201cMudbloods, filth, stains of dishonor, taint of shame on the house of my fathers \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cSHUT UP!\u201d Harry bellowed, directing his wand at her, and with a bang and a \nburst of red sparks, the curtains swung shut again, silencing her. \n\n \u201cThat . . . that was . . . \u201c Hermione whimpered, as Ron helped her to her feet. \n\n \u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbut it wasn\u2019t really him, was it? Just something to scare \nSnape.\u201d \nHad it worked, Harry wondered, or had Snape already blasted the horror-figure \naside as casually as he had killed the real Dumbledore? Nerves still tingling, he led the \nother two up the hall, half-expecting some new terror to reveal itself, but nothing moved \nexcept for a mouse skittering along the skirting board. \n\n \u201cBefore we go any farther, I think we\u2019d better check,\u201d whispered Hermione, and \nshe raised her wand and said, \u201cHomenum revelio.\u201d \n\n Nothing happened. \n\n \u201cWell, you\u2019ve just had a big shock,\u201d said Ron kindly. \u201cWhat was that supposed to \ndo?\u201d \n\n \u201cIt did what I meant it to do!\u201d said Hermione rather crossly. \u201cThat was a spell to \nreveal human presence, and there\u2019s nobody here except us!\u201d \n\u201cAnd old Dusty,\u201d said Ron, glancing at the patch of carpet from which the corpse-\nfigure had risen. \n\n \u201cLet\u2019s go up,\u201d said Hermione with a frightened look at the same spot, and she led \nthe way up the creaking stairs to the drawing room on the first floor. \n\n Hermione waved her wand to ignite the old gas lamps, then, shivering slightly in \nthe drafty room, she perched on the sofa, her arms wrapped tightly around her. Ron \ncrossed to the window and moved the heavy velvet curtains aside an inch. \n\n \u201cCan\u2019t see anyone out there,\u201d he reported. \u201cAnd you\u2019d think, if Harry still had a \nTrace on him, they\u2019d have followed us here. I know they can\u2019t get in the house, but \u2013 \nwhat\u2019s up, Harry?\u201d \n\n Harry had given a cry of pain: His scar had burned against as something flashed \nacross his mind like a bright light on water. He saw a large shadow and felt a fury that \nwas not his own pound through his body, violent and brief as an electric shock. \n\n \u201cWhat did you see?\u201d Ron asked, advancing on Harry. \u201cDid you see him at my \nplace?\u201d \n\n \u201cNo, I just felt anger \u2013 he\u2019s really angry \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cBut that could be at the Burrow,\u201d said Ron loudly. \u201cWhat else? Didn\u2019t you see \nanything? Was he cursing someone?\u201d \n\n\f\n \u201cNo, I just felt anger \u2013 I couldn\u2019t tell \u2013\u201c \n\n Harry felt badgered, confused, and Hermione did not help as she said in a \nfrightened voice, \u201cYour scar, again? But what\u2019s going on? I thought that connection had \nclosed!\u201d \n\n \u201cIt did, for a while,\u201d muttered Harry; his scar was still painful, which made it hard \nto concentrate. \u201cI \u2013 I think it\u2019s started opening again whenever he loses control, that\u2019s \nhow it used to \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cBut then you\u2019ve got to close your mind!\u201d said Hermione shrilly. \u201cHarry, \nDumbledore didn\u2019t want you to use that connection, he wanted you to shut it down, that\u2019s \nwhy you were supposed to use Occlumency! Otherwise Voldemort can plant false images \nin your mind, remember \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cYeah, I do remember, thanks,\u201d said Harry through gritted teeth; he did not need \nHermione to tell him that Voldemort had once used this selfsame connection between \nthem to lead him into a trap, nor that it had resulted in Sirius\u2019s death. He wished that he \nhad not told them what he had seen and felt; it made Voldemort more threatening, as \nthough he were pressing against the window of the room, and still the pain in his scar was \nbuilding and he fought it: It was like resisting the urge to be sick. \n\n He turned his back on Ron and Hermione, pretending to examine the old tapestry \nof the Black family tree on the wall. Then Hermione shrieked: Harry drew his wand again \nand spun around to see a silver Patronus soar through the drawing room window and land \nupon the floor in front of them, where it solidified into the weasel that spoke with the \nvoice of Ron\u2019s father. \n\n \u201cFamily safe, do not reply, we are being watched.\u201d \n\n The Patronus dissolved into nothingness. Ron let out a noise between a whimper \nand a groan and dropped onto the sofa: Hermione joined him, gripping his arm. \n\n \u201cThey\u2019re all right, they\u2019re all right!\u201d she whispered, and Ron half laughed and \nhugged her. \n\n \u201cHarry,\u201d he said over Hermione\u2019s shoulder, \u201cI \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem,\u201d said Harry, sickened by the pain in his head. \u201cIt\u2019s your \nfamily, \u2018course you were worried. I\u2019d feel the same way.\u201d He thought of Ginny. \u201cI do feel \nthe same way.\u201d \n\n The pain in his scar was reaching a peak, burning as it had back in the garden of \nthe Burrow. Faintly he heard Hermione say \u201cI don\u2019t want to be on my own. Could we use \nthe sleeping bags I\u2019ve brought and camp in here tonight?\u201d \n\n He heard Ron agree. He could not fight the pain much longer. He had to succumb. \n\n \u201cBathroom,\u201d he muttered, and he left the room as fast as he could without running. \n\n He barely made it: Bolting the door behind him with trembling hands, he grasped \nhis pounding head and fell to the floor, then in an explosion of agony, he felt the rage that \ndid not belong to him possess his soul, saw a long room lit only by firelight, and the giant \nblond Death Eater on the floor, screaming and writhing, and a slighter figure standing \nover him, wand outstretched, while Harry spoke in a high, cold, merciless voice. \n\n \u201cMore, Rowle, or shall we end it and feed you to Nagini? Lord Voldemort is not \nsure that he will forgive this time. . . . You called me back for this, to tell me that Harry \nPotter has escaped again? Draco, give Rowle another taste of our displeasure. . . . Do it, \nor feel my wrath yourself!\u201d \n\n\f\n A log fell in the fire: Flames reared, their light darting across a terrified, pointed \nwhite face \u2013 with a sense of emerging from deep water, Harry drew heaving breaths and \nopened his eyes. \n\n He was spread-eagled on the cold black marble floor, his nose inches from one of \nthe silver serpent tails that supported the large bathtub. He sat up. Malfoy\u2019s gaunt, \npetrified face seemed burned on the inside of his eyes. Harry felt sickened by what he had \nseen, by the use to which Draco was now being put by Voldemort. \n\n There was a sharp rap on the door, and Harry jumped as Hermione\u2019s voice rang \nout. \n\n \u201cHarry, do you want your toothbrush? I\u2019ve got it here.\u201d \n\n \u201cYeah, great, thanks,\u201d he said, fighting to keep his voice casual as he stood up to \nlet her in. \n\n \n\nChapter Ten \n\nKreacher\u2019s Tale \n\nHarry woke early next morning, wrapped in a sleeping bag on the drawing room \nfloor. A chink of sky was visible between the heavy curtains. It was the cool, clear blue \nof watered ink, somewhere between night and dawn, and everything was quiet except for \nRon and Hermione\u2019s slow, deep breathing. Harry glanced over at the dark shapes they \nmade on the floor beside him. Ron had had a fit of gallantry and insisted that Hermione \nsleep on the cushions from the sofa, so that her silhouette was raised above his. Her arm \ncurved to the floor, her fingers inches from Ron\u2019s. Harry wondered whether they had \nfallen asleep holding hands. The idea made him feel strangely lonely. \n\n He looked up at the shadowy ceiling, the cobwebbed chandelier. Less than \ntwenty-four house ago, he had been standing in the sunlight at the entrance to the \nmarquee, waiting to show in wedding guests. It seemed a lifetime away. What was going \nto happen now? He lay on the floor and he thought of the Horcruxes, of the daunting \ncomplex mission Dumbledore had left him\u2026 Dumbledore\u2026 \n\n The grief that had possessed him since Dumbledore\u2019s death felt different now. \nThe accusations he had heard from Muriel at the wedding seemed to have nested in his \nbrain like diseased things, infecting his memories of the wizard he had idolized. Could \nDumbledore have let such things happen? Had he been like Dudley, content to watch \nneglect and abuse as long as it did not affect him? Could he have turned his back on a \nsister who was being imprisoned and hidden? \n\n Harry thought of Godric\u2019s Hollow, of graves Dumbledore had never mentioned \nthere; he thought of mysterious objects left without explanation in Dumbledore\u2019s will, \nand resentment swelled in the darkness. Why hadn\u2019t Dumbledore told him? Why hadn\u2019t \nhe explained? Had Dumbledore actually cared about Harry at all? Or had Harry been \nnothing more than a tool to be polished and honed, but not trusted, never confided in? \n\n Harry could not stand lying there with nothing but bitter thoughts for company. \nDesperate for something to do, for distraction, he slipped out of his sleeping bad, picked \nup his wand, and crept out of the room. On the landing he whispered, \u201cLumos,\u201d and \nstarted to climb the stairs by wandlight. \n\n\f\n On the second landing was the bedroom in which he and Ron had slept last time \nthey had been here; he glanced into it. The wardrobe doors stood open and the bedclothes \nhad been ripped back. Harry remembered the overturned troll leg downstairs. Somebody \nhad searched the house since the Order had left. Snape? Or perhaps Mundungus, who had \npilfered plenty from this house both before and after Sirius died? Harry\u2019s gaze wandered \nto the portrait that sometimes contained Phineas Nigellus Black, Sirius\u2019s great-great \ngrandfather, but it was empty, showing nothing but a stretch of muddy backdrop. Phineas \nNigellus was evidently spending the night in the headmaster\u2019s study at Hogwarts. \n\n Harry continued up the stairs until he reached the topmost landing where there \nwere only two doors. The one facing him bore a nameplate reading Sirius. Harry had \nnever entered his godfather\u2019s bedroom before. He pushed open the door, holding his \nwand high to cast light as widely as possible. The room was spacious and must once have \nbeen handsome. There was a large bed with a carved wooden headboard, a tall window \nobscured by long velvet curtains and a chandelier thickly coated in dust with candle \nscrubs still resting in its sockets, solid wax banging in frostlike drips. A fine film of dust \ncovered the pictures on the walls and the bed\u2019s headboard; a spiders web stretched \nbetween the chandelier and the top of the large wooden wardrobe, and as Harry moved \ndeeper into the room, he head a scurrying of disturbed mice. \n\n The teenage Sirius had plastered the walls with so many posters and pictures that \nlittle of the wall\u2019s silvery-gray silk was visible. Harry could only assume that Sirius\u2019s \nparents had been unable to remove the Permanent Sticking Charm that kept them on the \nwall because he was sure they would not have appreciated their eldest son\u2019s taste in \ndecoration. Sirius seemed to have long gone out of his way to annoy his parents. There \nwere several large Gryffindor banners, faded scarlet and gold just to underline his \ndifference from all the rest of the Slytherin family. There were many pictures of Muggle \nmotorcycles, and also (Harry had to admire Sirius\u2019s nerve) several posters of bikini-clad \nMuggle girls. Harry could tell that they were Muggles because they remained quite \nstationary within their pictures, faded smiles and glazed eyes frozen on the paper. This \nwas in contrast the only Wizarding photograph on the walls which was a picture of four \nHogwarts students standing arm in arm, laughing at the camera. \n\n With a leap of pleasure, Harry recognized his father, his untidy black hair stuck \nup at the back like Harry\u2019s, and he too wore glasses. Beside him was Sirius, carelessly \nhandsome, his slightly arrogant face so much younger and happier than Harry had ever \nseen it alive. To Sirius\u2019s right stood Pettigrew, more than a head shorter, plump and \nwatery-eyed, flushed with pleasure at his inclusion in this coolest of gangs, with the \nmuch-admired rebels that James and Sirius had been. On James\u2019s left was Lupin, even \nthen a little shabby-looking, but he had the same air of delighted surprise at finding \nhimself liked and included or was it simply because Harry knew how it had been, that he \nsaw these things in the picture? He tried to take it from the wall; it was his now, after all, \nSirius had left him everything, but it would not budge. Sirius had taken no chances in \npreventing his parents from redecorating his room. \n\n Harry looked around at the floor. The sky outside was growing brightest. A shaft \nof light revealed bits of paper, books, and small objects scattered over the carpet. \nEvidently Sirius\u2019s bedroom had been reached too, although its contents seemed to have \nbeen judged mostly, if not entirely, worthless. A few of the books had been shaken \nroughly enough to part company with the covers and sundry pages littered the floor. \n\n\f\n Harry bent down, picked up a few of the pieces of paper, and examined them. He \nrecognized one as a part of an old edition of A History of Magic, by Bathilda Bagshot, \nand another as belonging to a motorcycle maintenance manual. The third was \nhandwritten and crumpled. He smoothed it out. \n\n \n\n Dear Padfoot, \n\n Thank you, thank you, for Harry\u2019s birthday present! It was his favorite by \nfar. One year old and already zooming along on a toy broomstick, he looked so pleased \nwith himself. I\u2019m enclosing a picture so you can see. You know it only rises about two feet \noff the ground but he nearly killed the cat and he smashed a horrible vase Petunia sent \nme for Christmas (no complaints there). Of course James thought it was so funny, says \nhe\u2019s going to be a great Quidditch player but we\u2019ve had to pack away all the ornaments \nand make sure we don\u2019t take our eyes off him when he gets going. \n\n We had a very quiet birthday tea, just us and old Bathilda who has always been \nsweet to us and who dotes on Garry. We were so sorry you couldn\u2019t come, but the \nOrder\u2019s got to come first, and Harry\u2019s not old enough to know it\u2019s his birthday anyway! \nJames is getting a bit frustrated shut up here, he tries not to show it but I can tell \u2013 also \nDumbledore\u2019s still got his Invisibility Cloak, so no chance of little excursions. If you \ncould visit, it would cheer him up so much. Wormy was here last weekend. I thought he \nseemed down, but that was probably the next about the McKinnons; I cried all evening \nwhen I heard. \n\n Bathilda drops in most days, she\u2019s a fascinating old thing with the most amazing \nstories about Dumbledore. I\u2019m not sure he\u2019d be pleased if he knew! I don\u2019t know how \nmuch to believe, actually because it seems incredible that Dumbledore \n\n \n\n Harry\u2019s extremities seemed to have gone numb. He stood quite still, holding the \nmiraculous paper in his nerveless fingers while inside him a kind of quiet eruptions sent \njoy and grief thundering its equal measure through his veins. Lurching to the bed, he sat \ndown. \n\n He read the letter again, but could not take in any more meaning than he had done \nthe first time, and was reduced to staring at the handwriting itself. She had made her \u201cg\u201ds \nthe same way he did. He searched through the letter for every one of them, and each felt \nlike a friendly little wave glimpsed from behind a veil. The letter was an incredible \ntreasure, proof that Lily Potter had lived, really lived, that her warm hand had once \nmoved across this parchment, tracing ink into these letters, these words, words about him, \nHarry, her son. \n\n Impatiently brushing away the wetness in his eyes, he reread the letter, this time \nconcentrating on the meaning. It was like listening to a half-remembered voice. \n\n They had a cat\u2026 perhaps it had perished, like his parents at Godric\u2019s Hollow\u2026 or \nelse fled when there was nobody left to feed it\u2026 Sirius had bought him his first \nbroomstick\u2026 His parents had known Bathilda Bagshot; had Dumbledore introduced \nthem? Dumbledore\u2019s still got his Invisibility Cloak\u2026 there was something funny there\u2026 \n\n Harry paused, pondering his mother\u2019s words. Why had Dumbledore taken \nJames\u2019s Invisibility Cloak? Harry distinctly remembered his headmaster telling him years \nbefore, \u201cI don\u2019t need a cloak to become invisible\u201d Perhaps some less gifted Order \n\n\f\nmember had needed its assistance, and Dumbledore had acted as a carrier? Harry passed \non\u2026 \n\n Wormy was here\u2026 Pettigrew, the traitor, had seemed \u201cdown\u201d had he? Was he \naware that he was seeing James and Lily alive for the last time? \n\n And finally Bathilda again, who told incredible stories about Dumbledore. It \nseems incredible that Dumbledore --- \n\n That Dumbledore what? But there were any number of things that would seem \nincredible about Dumbledore; that he had once received bottom marks in a \nTransfiguration test, for instance or had taken up goat charming like Aberforth\u2026 \n\n Harry got to his feet and scanned the floor: Perhaps the rest of the letter was here \nsomewhere. He seized papers, treating them in his eagerness, with as little consideration \nas the original searcher, he pulled open drawers, shook out books, stood on a chair to run \nhis hand over the top of the wardrobe, and crawled under the bed and armchair. \n\n At last, lying facedown on the floor, he spotted what looked like a torn piece of \npaper under the chest of drawers. When he pulled it out, it proved to be most of the \nphotograph that Lily had described in her letter. A black-haired baby was zooming in and \nout of the picture on a tiny broom, roaring with laughter, and a pair of legs that must have \nbelonged to James was chasing after him. Harry tucked the photograph into his pocket \nwith Lily\u2019s letter and continued to look for the second sheet. \n\n After another quarter of an hour, however he was forced to conclude that the rest \nof his mother\u2019s letter was gone. Had it simply been lost in the sixteen years that had \nelapsed since it had been written, or had it been taken by whoever had searched the \nroom? Harry read the first sheet again, this time looking for clues as to what might have \nmade the second sheet valuable. His toy broomstick could hardly be considered \ninteresting to the Death Eaters\u2026 The only potentially useful thing he could see her was \npossible information on Dumbledore. It seems incredible that Dumbledore \u2013 what? \n\n \u201cHarry? Harry? Harry!\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019m here!\u201d he called, \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d \n\nThere was a clatter of footsteps outside the door, and Hermione burst inside. \n\n\u201cWe woke up and didn\u2019t know where you were!\u201d she said breathlessly. She turned \nand shouted over her shoulder, \u201cRon! I\u2019ve found him\u201d \n\nRon\u2019s annoyed voice echoed distantly from several floors below. \n\n\u201cGood! Tell him from me he\u2019s a git!\u201d \n\n\u201cHarry don\u2019t just disappear, please, we were terrified! Why did you come up here \nanyway?\u201d She gazed around the ransacked room. \u201cWhat have you been doing?\u201d \n\n\u201cLook what I\u2019ve just found\u201d \n\nHe held out his mother\u2019s letter. Hermione took it out and read it while Harry \nwatched her. When she reached the end of the page she looked up at him. \n\n\u201cOh Harry\u2026\u201d \n\u201cAnd there\u2019s this too\u201d \n\nHe handed her the torn photograph, and Hermione smiled at the baby zooming in \nand out of sight on the toy broom. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been looking for the rest of the letter,\u201d Harry said, \u201cbut it\u2019s not here.\u201d \n\nHermione glanced around. \n\n\u201cDid you make all this mess, or was some of it done when you got here?\u201d \n\n\u201cSomeone had searched before me,\u201d said Harry. \n\n\f\n\u201cI thought so. Every room I looked into on the way up had been disturbed. What \nwere they after, do you think?\u201d \n\n\u201cInformation on the Order, if it was Snape.\u201d \n\n\u201cBut you\u2019d think he\u2019d already have all he needed. I mean was in the Order, wasn\u2019t \nhe?\u201d \n\n\u201cWell then,\u201d said Harry, keen to discuss his theory, \u201cwhat about information on \nDumbledore? The second page of the letter, for instance. You know this Bathilda my \nmum mentions, you know who she is?\u201d \n\n\u201cWho?\u201d \n\n\u201cBathilda Bagshot, the author of \u2013\u201c \n\n\u201cA History of Magic,\u201d said Hermione, looking interested. \u201cSo your parents knew \nher? She was an incredible magic historian.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd she\u2019s still alive,\u201d said Harry, \u201cand she lives in Godric\u2019s Hollow. Ron\u2019s \nAuntie Muriel was talking about her at the wedding. She knew Dumbledore\u2019s family too. \nBe pretty interesting to talk to, wouldn\u2019t she?\u201d There was a little too much understanding \nin the smile Hermione gave him for Harry\u2019s liking. He took back the letter and the \nphotograph and tucked them inside the pouch around his neck, so as not to have to look at \nher and give himself away. \u201cI understand why you\u2019d love to talk to her about your mum \nand dad, and Dumbledore too,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cBut that wouldn\u2019t really help us in our \nsearch for the Horcruxes, would it?\u201d Harry did not answer, and she rushed on, \u201cHarry, I \nknow you really want to go to Godric\u2019s Hollow, but I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m scared at how easily \nthose Death Eaters found us yesterday. It just makes me feel more than ever that we \nought to avoid the place where your parents are buried, I\u2019m sure they\u2019d be expecting you \nto visit it.\u201d \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just that,\u201d Harry said, still avoiding looking at her, \u201cMuriel said stuff \nabout Dumbledore at the wedding. I want to know the truth\u2026\u201d \n\n He told Hermione everything that Muriel had told him. When he had finished, \nHermione said, \u201cOf course, I can see why that\u2019s upset you, Harry \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cI\u2019m not upset,\u201d he lied, \u201cI\u2019d just like to know whether or not it\u2019s true or \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cHarry do you really think you\u2019ll get the truth from a malicious old woman like \nMuriel, or from Rita Skeeter? How can you believe them? You knew Dumbledore!\u201d \n\n \u201cI thought I did,\u201d he muttered. \n\n \u201cBut you know how much truth there was in everything Rita wrote about you! \nDoge is right, how can you let these people tarnish your memories of Dumbledore?\u201d \n\n He looked away, trying not to betray the resentment he felt. There it was again: \nChoose what to believe. He wanted the truth. Why was everybody so determined that he \nshould not get it? \n\n \u201cShall we go down to the kitchen?\u201d Hermione suggested after a little pause. \u201cFind \nsomething for breakfast?\u201d \n\n He agreed, but grudgingly, and followed her out onto the landing and past the \nsecond door that led off it. There were deep scratch marks in the paintwork below a small \nsign that he had not noticed in the dark. He passed at the top of the stairs to read it. It was \na pompous little sign, neatly lettered by hand the sort of thing that Percy Weasley might \nhave stuck on his bedroom door. \n\n \n\nDo Not Enter \n\n\f\nWithout the Express Permission of \n\nRegulus Arcturus Black \n\n \n\nExcitement trickled through Harry, but he was not immediately sure why. He read the \nsign again. Hermione was already a flight of stairs below him. \n\n \u201cHermione,\u201d he said, and he was surprised that his voice was so calm. \u201cCome \nback up here.\u201d \n\n \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d \n\n \u201cR.A.B. I think I\u2019ve found him.\u201d \n\n There was a gasp, and then Hermione ran back up the stairs. \n\n \u201cIn your mum\u2019s letter? But I didn\u2019t see \u2013\u201c \n\n Harry shook his head, pointing at Regulus\u2019s sign. She read it, then clutched \nHarry\u2019s arm so tightly that he winced. \n\n \u201cSirius\u2019s brother?\u201d she whispered. \n\n \u201cHe was a Death Eater,\u201d said Harry. \u201cSirius told me about him, he joined up when \nhe was really young and then got cold feet and tried to leave \u2013 so they killed him.\u201d \n\n \u201cThat fits!\u201d gasped Hermione. \u201cIf he was a Death Eater he had access to \nVoldemort, and if he became disenchanted, then he would have wanted to bring \nVoldemort down!\u201d \n\n She released Harry, leaned over the banister, and screamed, \u201cRon! RON! Get up \nhere, quick!\u201d \n\n Ron appeared, panting, a minute later, his wand ready in his hand. \n\n \u201cWhat\u2019s up? If it\u2019s massive spiders again I want breakfast before I \u2013\u201c \n\n He frowned at the sign on Regulus\u2019s door, in which Hermione was silently \npointing. \n\n \u201cWhat? That was Sirius\u2019s brother, wasn\u2019t it? Regulus Arcturus \u2026 Regulus \u2026 \nR.A.B.! The locket \u2013 you don\u2019t reckon -- ?\u201d \n\n \u201cLet\u2019s find out,\u201d said Harry. He pushed the door: It was locked. Hermione pointed \nher wand at the handle and said, \u201cAlohamora.\u201d There was a click, and the door swung \nopen. \n\n They moved over the threshold together, gazing around. Regulus\u2019s bedroom was \nslightly smaller than Sirius\u2019s, though it had the same sense of former grandeur. Whereas \nSirius had sought to advertise his diffidence from the rest of the family, Regulus had \nstriven to emphasize the opposite. The Slytherin colors of emerald and silver were \neverywhere, draping the bed, the walls, and the windows. The Black family crest was \npainstakingly painted over the bed, along with its motto, TOUJOURS PUR. Beneath this \nwas a collection of yellow newspaper cuttings, all stuck together to make a ragged \ncollage. Hermione crossed the room to examine them. \n\n \u201cThey\u2019re all about Voldemort,\u201d she said. \u201cRegulus seems to have been a fan for a \nfew years before he joined the Death Eaters \u2026\u201d \n\n A little puff of dust rose from the bedcovers as she sat down to read the clippings. \nHarry, meanwhile, had noticed another photograph: a Hogwarts Quidditch team was \nsmiling and waving out of the frame. He moved closer and saw the snakes emblazoned \non their chests: Slytherins. Regulus was instantly recognizable as the boy sitting in the \nmiddle of the front row: He had the same dark hair and slightly haughty look of his \nbrother, though he was smaller, slighter, and rather less handsome than Sirius had been. \n\n\f\n \u201cHe played Seeker,\u201d said Harry. \n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Hermione vaguely; she was still immersed in Voldemort\u2019s press \nclippings. \n\n \u201cHe\u2019s sitting in the middle of the front row, that\u2019s where the Seeker \u2026 Never \nmind,\u201d said Harry, realizing that nobody was listening. Ron was on his hands and knees, \nsearching under the wardrobe. Harry looked around the room for likely hiding places and \napproached the desk. Yet again, somebody had searched before them. The drawers\u2019 \ncontents had been turned over recently, the dust disturbed, but there was nothing of value \nthere: old quills, out-of-date textbooks that bore evidence of being roughly handled, a \nrecently smashed ink bottle, its sticky residue covering the contents of the drawer. \n\n \u201cThere\u2019s an easier way,\u201d said Hermione, as Harry wiped his inky fingers on his \njeans. She raised her wand and said, \u201cAccio Locket!\u201d \n\n Nothing happened. Ron, who had been searching the folds of the faded curtains, \nlooked disappointed. \n\n \u201cIs that it, then? It\u2019s not here?\u201d \n\n \u201cOh, it could still be here, but under counter-enchantments,\u201d said Hermione. \n\u201cCharms to prevent it from being summoned magically, you know.\u201d \n\n \u201cLike Voldemort put on the stone basin in the cave,\u201d said Harry, remembering \nhow he had been unable to Summon the fake locket. \n\n \u201cHow are we supposed to find it then?\u201d asked Ron. \n\n \u201cWe search manually,\u201d said Hermione. \n\n \u201cThat\u2019s a good idea,\u201d said Ron, rolling his eyes, and he resumed his examination \nof the curtains. \n\n They combed every inch of the room for more than an hour, but were forced, \nfinally, to conclude that the locket was not there. \n\n The sun had risen now; its light dazzled them even through the grimy landing \nwindows. \n\n \u201cIt could be somewhere else in the house, though,\u201d said Hermione in a rallying \ntone as they walked back downstairs. As Harry and Ron had become more discouraged, \nshe seemed to have become more determined. \u201cWhether he\u2019d manage to destroy it or not, \nhe\u2019d want to keep it hidden from Voldemort, wouldn\u2019t he? Remember all those awful \nthings we had to get rid of when we were here last time? That clock that shot bolts at \neveryone and those old robes that tried to strangle Ron; Regulus might have put them \nthere to protect the locket\u2019s hiding place, even though we didn\u2019t realize it at \u2026 at \u2026 \u201c \n\n Harry and Ron looked at her. She was standing with one foot in midair, with the \ndumbstruck look of one who had just been Obliviated: her eyes had even drifted out of \nfocus. \n\n \u201c\u2026 at the time,\u201d she finished in a whisper. \n\n \u201cSomething wrong?\u201d asked Ron. \n\n \u201cThere was a locket.\u201d \n\n \u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry and Ron together. \n\n \u201cIn the cabinet in the drawing room. Nobody could open it. And we \u2026 we \u2026 \u201c \n\n Harry felt as though a brick had slid down through his chest into his stomach. He \nremembered. He had even handled the thing as they passed it around, each trying in turn \nto pry it open. It had been tossed into a sack of rubbish, along with the snuffbox of \nWartcap powder and the music box that had made everyone sleepy \u2026\u201d \n\n\f\n \u201cKreacher nicked loads of things back from us,\u201d said Harry. It was the only \nchance, the only slender hope left to them, and he was going to cling to it until forced to \nlet go. \u201cHe had a whole stash of stuff in his cupboard in the kitchen. C\u2019mon.\u201d \n\n He ran down the stairs taking two steps at a time, the other two thundering along \nin his wake. They made so much noise that they woke the portrait of Sirius\u2019s mother as \nthey passed through the hall. \n\n \u201cFilth! Mudbloods! Scum!\u201d she screamed after them as they dashed down into the \nbasement kitchen and slammed the door behind them. Harry ran the length of the room, \nskidded to a halt at the door of Kreacher\u2019s cupboard, and wrenched it open. There was the \nnest of dirty old blankets in which the house-elf had once slept, but they were not longer \nglittering with the trinkets Kreacher had salvaged. The only thing there was an old copy \nof Nature\u2019s Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. Refusing to believe his eyes, Harry \nsnatched up the blankets and shook them. A dead mouse fell out and rolled dismally \nacross the floor. Ron groaned as he threw himself into a kitchen chair; Hermione closed \nher eyes. \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s not over yet,\u201d said Harry, and he raised his voice and called, \u201cKreacher!\u201d \n\n There was a loud crack and the house elf that Harry had so reluctantly inherited \nfrom Sirius appeared out of nowhere in front of the cold and empty fireplace: tiny, half \nhuman-sized, his pale skin hanging off him in folds, white hair sprouting copiously from \nhis batlike ears. He was still wearing the filthy rag in which they had first met him, and \nthe contemptuous look he bent upon Harry showed that his attitude to his change of \nownership had altered no more than his outfit. \n\n \u201cMaster,\u201d croaked Kreacher in his bullfrog\u2019s voice, and he bowed low; muttering \nto his knees, \u201cback in my Mistress\u2019s old house with the blood-traitor Weasley and the \nMudblood \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cI forbid you to call anyone \u2018blood traitor\u2019 or \u2018Mudblood,\u2019\u201d growled Harry. He \nwould have found Kreacher, with his snoutlike nose and bloodshot eyes, a distinctively \nunlovable object even if the elf had not betrayed Sirius to Voldemort. \n\n \u201cI\u2019ve got a question for you,\u201d said Harry, his heart beating rather fast as he looked \ndown at the elf, \u201cand I order you to answer it truthfully. Understand?\u201d \n\n \u201cYes, Master,\u201d said Kreacher, bowing low again. Harry saw his lips moving \nsoundlessly, undoubtedly framing the insults he was now forbidden to utter. \n\n \u201cTwo years ago,\u201d said Harry, his heart now hammering against his ribs, \u201cthere \nwas a big gold locket in the drawing room upstairs. We threw it out. Did you steal it \nback?\u201d \n\n There was a moment\u2019s silence, during which Kreacher straightened up to look \nHarry full in the face. Then he said, \u201cYes.\u201d \n\n \u201cWhere is it now?\u201d asked Harry jubilantly as Ron and Hermione looked gleeful. \n\n Kreacher closed his eyes as though he could not bear to see their reactions to his \nnext word. \n\n \u201cGone.\u201d \n\n \u201cGone?\u201d echoed Harry, elation floating out of him, \u201cWhat do you mean, it\u2019s \ngone?\u201d \n\n The elf shivered. He swayed. \n\n \u201cKreacher,\u201d said Harry fiercely, \u201cI order you \u2013\u201c \n\n\f\n \u201cMundungus Fletcher,\u201d croaked the elf, his eyes still tight shut. \u201cMundungus \nFletcher stole it all; Miss Bella\u2019s and Miss Cissy\u2019s pictures, my Mistress\u2019s gloves, the \nOrder of Merlin, First Class, the goblets with the family crest, and \u2013 and \u2013 \u201c \n\n Kreacher was gulping for air: His hollow chest was rising and falling rapidly, then \nhis eyes flew open and he uttered a bloodcurdling scream. \n\n \u201c\u2014and the locket, Master Regulus\u2019s locket. Kreacher did wrong, Kreacher failed \nin his orders!\u201d \n\n Harry reacted instinctively: As Kreacher lunged for the poker standing in the grate, \nhe launched himself upon the elf, flattening him. Hermione\u2019s scream mingled with \nKreacher\u2019s but Harry bellowed louder than both of them: \u201cKreacher, I order you to stay \nstill!\u201d \n\n He felt the elf freeze and released him. Kreacher lay flat on the cold stone floor, \ntears gushing from his sagging eyes. \n\n \u201cHarry, let him up!\u201d Hermione whispered. \n\n \u201cSo he can beat himself up with the poker?\u201d snorted Harry, kneeling beside the elf. \n\u201cI don\u2019t think so. Right. Kreacher, I want the truth: How do you know Mundungus \nFletcher stole the locket?\u201d \n\n \u201cKreacher saw him!\u201d gasped the elf as tears poured over his snout and into his \nmouth full of graying teeth. \u201cKreacher saw him coming out of Kreacher\u2019s cupboard with \nhis hands full of Kreacher\u2019s treasures. Kreacher told the sneak thief to stop, but \nMundungus Fletcher laughed and r-ran \u2026 \u201c \n\n \u201cYou called the locket \u2018Master Regulus\u2019s,\u2019\u201d said Harry. \u201cWhy? Where did it \ncome from? What did Regulus have to do with it? Kreacher, sit up and tell me everything \nyou know about that locket, and everything Regulus had to do with it!\u201d \n\n The elf sat up, curled into a ball, placed his wet face between his knees, and began \nto rock backward and forward. When he spoke, his voice was muffled but quite distinct \nin the silent, echoing kitchen. \n\n \u201cMaster Sirius ran away, good riddance, for he was a bad boy and broke my \nMistress\u2019s heart with his lawless ways. But Master Regulus had proper order; he knew \nwhat was due to the name of Black and the dignity of his pure blood. For years he talked \nof the Dark Lord, who was going to bring the wizards out of hiding to rule the Muggles \nand the Muggle-borns \u2026 and when he was sixteen years old, Master Regulus joined the \nDark Lord. So proud, so proud, so happy to serve \u2026 \n\n And one day, a year after he joined, Master Regulus came down to the kitchen to \nsee Kreacher. Master Regulus always liked Kreacher. And Master Regulus said \u2026 he \nsaid \u2026\u201d \n\n The old elf rocked faster than ever. \n\n \u201c\u2026 he said that the Dark Lord required an elf.\u201d \n\n \u201cVoldemort needed an elf?\u201d Harry repeated, looking around at Ron and Hermione, \nwho looked just as puzzled as he did. \n\n \u201cOh yes,\u201d moaned Kreacher. \u201cAnd Master Regulus had volunteered Kreacher. It \nwas an honor, said Master Regulus, an honor for him and for Kreacher, who must be sure \nto do whatever the Dark Lord ordered him to do \u2026 and then to c-come home.\u201d \n\n Kreacher rocked still faster, his breath coming in sobs. \n\n\f\n \u201cSo Kreacher went to the Dark Lord. The Dark Lord did not tell Kreacher what \nthey were to do, but took Kreacher with him to a cave beside the sea. And beyond the \ncave was a cavern, and in the cavern was a great black lake \u2026 \u201c \n\n The hairs on the back of Harry\u2019s neck stood up. Kreacher\u2019s croaking voice \nseemed to come to him from across the dark water. He saw what had happened as clearly \nas though he had been present. \n\n \u201c\u2026 There was a boat \u2026\u201d \n\n Of course there had been a boat; Harry knew the boat, ghostly green and tiny, \nbewitched so as to carry one wizard and one victim toward the island in the center. This, \nthen, was how Voldemort had tested the defenses surrounding the Horcrux, by borrowing \na disposable creature, a house-elf\u2026 \n\n \u201cThere was a b-basin full of potion on the island. The D-Dark Lord made \nKreacher drink it \u2026\u201d \n\n The elf quaked from head to foot. \n\n \u201cKreacher drank, and as he drank he saw terrible thing \u2026 Kreacher\u2019s insides \nburned \u2026 Kreacher cried for Master Regulus to save him, he cried for his Mistress Black, \nbut the Dark Lord only laughed \u2026 He made Kreacher drink all the potion \u2026 He dropped \na locket into the empty basin \u2026 He filled it with more potion.\u201d \n\n \u201cAnd then the Dark Lord sailed away, leaving Kreacher on the island \u2026 \u201c \n\n Harry could see it happening. He watched Voldemort\u2019s white, snakelike face \nvanishing into darkness, those red eyes fixed pitilessly on the thrashing elf whose death \nwould occur within minutes, whenever he succumbed to the desperate thirst that the \nburning poison caused its victim \u2026 But here, Harry\u2019s imagination could go no further, \nfor he could not see how Kreacher had escaped. \n\n \u201cKreacher needed water, he crawled to the island\u2019s edge and he drank from the \nblack lake \u2026 and hands, dead hands, came out of the water and dragged Kreacher under \nthe surface \u2026 \u201c \n\n \u201cHow did you get away?\u201d Harry asked, and he was not surprised to hear himself \nwhispering. \n\n Kreacher raised his ugly head and looked Harry with his great, bloodshot eyes. \n\n \u201cMaster Regulus told Kreacher to come back,\u201d he said. \n\n \u201cI know \u2013 but how did you escape the Inferi?\u201d \n\n Kreacher did not seem to understand. \n\n \u201cMaster Regulus told Kreacher to come back,\u201d he repeated. \n\n \u201cI know, but \u2013 \u201c \n\n \u201cWell, it\u2019s obvious, isn\u2019t it, Harry?\u201d said Ron. \u201cHe Disapparated!\u201d \n\n \u201cBut \u2026 you couldn\u2019t Apparate in and out of that cave,\u201d said Harry, \u201cotherwise \nDumbledore \u2013 \u201c \n\n \u201cElf magic isn\u2019t like wizard\u2019s magic, is it?\u201d said Ron, \u201cI mean, they can Apparate \nand Disapparate in and out of Hogwarts when we can\u2019t.\u201d \n\n There was a silence as Harry digested this. How could Voldemort have made such \na mistake? But even as he thought this, Hermione spoke, and her voice was icy. \n\n \u201cOf course, Voldemort would have considered the ways of house-elves far \nbeneath his notice \u2026 It would never have occurred to him that they might have magic \nthat he didn\u2019t.\u201d \n\n\f\n \u201cThe house-elf\u2019s highest law is his Master\u2019s bidding,\u201d intoned Kreacher. \n\u201cKreacher was told to come home, so Kreacher came home \u2026 \u201c \n\n \u201cWell, then, you did what you were told, didn\u2019t you?\u201d said Hermione kindly. \n\u201cYou didn\u2019t disobey orders at all!\u201d \n\n Kreacher shook his head, rocking as fast as ever. \n\n \u201cSo what happened when you got back?\u201d Harry asked. \u201cWhat did Regulus say \nwhen you told him what happened?\u201d \n\n \u201cMaster Regulus was very worried, very worried,\u201d croaked Kreacher. \u201cMaster \nRegulus told Kreacher to stay hidden and not to leave the house. And then \u2026 it was a \nlittle while later \u2026 Master Regulus came to find Kreacher in his cupboard one night, and \nMaster Regulus was strange, not as he usually was, disturbed in his mind, Kreacher could \ntell \u2026 and he asked Kreacher to take him to the cave, the cave where Kreacher had gone \nwith the Dark Lord \u2026 \u201c \n\n And so they had set off. Harry could visualize them quite clearly, the frightened \nold elf and the thin, dark Seeker who had so resembled Sirius \u2026 Kreacher knew how to \nopen the concealed entrance to the underground cavern, knew how to raise the tiny boat: \nthis time it was his beloved Regulus who sailed with him to the island with its basin of \npoison \u2026 \n\n \u201cAnd he made you drink the poison?\u201d said Harry, disgusted. \n\n But Kreacher shook his head and wept. Hermione\u2019s hands leapt to her mouth: She \nseemed to have understood something. \n\n \u201cM-Master Regulus took from his pocket a locket like the one the Dark Lord \nhad,\u201d said Kreacher, tears pouring down either side of his snoutlike nose. \u201cAnd he told \nKreacher to take it and, when the basin was empty, to switch the lockets \u2026\u201d \n\n Kreacher\u2019s sobs came in great rasps now; Harry had to concentrate hard to \nunderstand him. \n\n \u201cAnd he order \u2013 Kreacher to leave \u2013 without him. And he told Kreacher \u2013 to go \nhome \u2013 and never to tell my Mistress \u2013 what he had done \u2013 but to destroy \u2013 the first \nlocket. And he drank \u2013 all the potion \u2013 and Kreacher swapped the lockets \u2013 and watched \n\u2026 as Master Regulus \u2026 was dragged beneath the water \u2026 and \u2026 \u201c \n\n \u201cOh, Kreacher!\u201d wailed Hermione, who was crying. She dropped to her knees \nbeside the elf and tried to hug him. At once he was on his feet, cringing away from her, \nquite obviously repulsed. \n\n \u201cThe Mudblood touched Kreacher, he will not allow it, what would his Mistress \nsay?\u201d \n\n \u201cI told you not to call her \u2018Mudblood\u2019!\u201d snarled Harry, but the elf was already \npunishing himself. He fell to the ground and banged his forehead on the floor. \n\n \u201cStop him \u2013 stop him!\u201d Hermione cried. \u201cOh, don\u2019t you see now how sick it is, \nthe way they\u2019ve got to obey?\u201d \n\n \u201cKreacher \u2013 stop, stop!\u201d shouted Harry. \n\n The elf lay on the floor, panting and shivering, green mucus glistening around his \nsnot, a bruise already blooming on his pallid forehead where he had struck himself, his \neyes swollen and bloodshot and swimming in tears. Harry had never seen anything so \npitiful. \n\n \u201cSo you brought the locket home,\u201d he said relentlessly, for he was determined to \nknow the full story. \u201cAnd you tried to destroy it?\u201d \n\n\f\n \u201cNothing Kreacher did made any mark upon it,\u201d moaned the elf. \u201cKreacher tried \neverything, everything he knew, but nothing, nothing would work \u2026 So many powerful \nspells upon the casing, Kreacher was sure the way to destroy it was to get inside it, but it \nwould not open \u2026 Kreacher punished himself, he tried again, he punished himself, he \ntried again. Kreacher failed to obey orders, Kreacher could not destroy the locket! And \nhis mistress was mad with grief, because Master Regulus had disappeared and Kreacher \ncould not tell her what had happened, no, because Master Regulus had f-f-forbidden him \nto tell any of the f-f-family what happened in the c-cave \u2026\u201d \n\n Kreacher began to sob so hard that there were no more coherent words. Tears \nflowed down Hermione\u2019s cheeks as she watched Kreacher, but she did not dare touch \nhim again. Even Ron, who was no fan of Kreacher\u2019s, looked troubled. Harry sat back on \nhis heels and shook his head, trying to clear it. \n\n \u201cI don\u2019t understand you, Kreacher,\u201d he said finally. \u201cVoldemort tried to kill you, \nRegulus died to bring Voldemort down, but you were still happy to betray Sirius to \nVoldemort? You were happy to go to Narcissa and Bellatrix, and pass information to \nVoldemort through them \u2026 \u201c \n\n \u201cHarry, Kreacher doesn\u2019t think like that,\u201d said Hermione, wiping her eyes on the \nback of her hand. \u201cHe\u2019s a slave; house-elves are used to bad, even brutal treatment; what \nVoldemort did to Kreacher wasn\u2019t that far out of the common way. What do wizard wars \nmean to an elf like Kreacher? He\u2019s loyal to people who are kind to him, and Mrs. Black \nmust have been, and Regulus certainly was, so he served them willingly and parroted \ntheir beliefs. I know what you\u2019re going to say,\u201d she went on as Harry began to protest, \n\u201cthat Regulus changed his mind \u2026 but he doesn\u2019t seem to have explained that to \nKreacher, does he?\u201d And I think I know why. Kreacher and Regulus\u2019s family were all \nsafest if they kept to the old pure-blood line. Regulus was trying to protect them all.\u201d \n\n \u201cSirius \u2013 \u201c \n\n \u201cSirius was horrible to Kreacher, Harry, and it\u2019s no good looking like that, you \nknow it\u2019s true. Kreacher had been alone for such a long time when Sirius came to live \nhere, and he was probably starving for a bit of affection. I\u2019m sure \u2018Miss Cissy\u2019 and \u2018Miss \nBella\u2019 were perfectly lovely to Kreacher when he turned up, so he did them a favor and \ntold them everything they wanted to know. I\u2019ve said all along that wizards would pay for \nhow they treat house-elves. Well, Voldemort did \u2026 and so did Sirius.\u201d \n\n Harry had no retort. As he watched Kreacher sobbing on the floor, he \nremembered what Dumbledore had said to him, mere hours after Sirius\u2019s death: I do not \nthink Sirius ever saw Kreacher as a being with feelings as acute as a human\u2019s \u2026 \n\n \u201cKreacher,\u201d said Harry after a while, \u201cwhen you feel up to it, er \u2026 please sit up.\u201d \n\n It was several minutes before Kreacher hiccupped himself into silence. Then he \npushed himself into a sitting position again, rubbing his knuckles into his eyes like a \nsmall child. \n\n \u201cKreacher, I am going to ask you to do something,\u201d said Harry. He glanced at \nHermione for assistance. He wanted to give the order kindly, but at the same time, he \ncould not pretend that it was not an order. However, the change in his tone seemed to \nhave gained her approval: She smiled encouragingly. \n\n \u201cKreacher, I want you, please, to go and find Mundungus Fletcher. We need to \nfind out where the locket \u2013 where Master Regulus\u2019s locket it. It\u2019s really important. We \n\n\f\nwant to finish the work Master Regulus started, we want to \u2013 er \u2013 ensure that he didn\u2019t \ndie in vain.\u201d \n\n Kreacher dropped his fists and looked up at Harry. \n\n \u201cFind Mundungus Fletcher?\u201d he croaked. \n\n And bring him here, to Grimmauld Place,\u201d said Harry. \u201cDo you think you could \ndo that for us?\u201d \n\n As Kreacher nodded and got to his feet, Harry had a sudden inspiration. He pulled \nout Hagrid\u2019s purse and took out the fake Horcrux, the substitute locket in which Regulus \nhad placed the note to Voldemort. \n\n \u201cKreacher, I\u2019d, er, like you to have this,\u201d he said, pressing the locket into the elf\u2019s \nhand. \u201cThis belonged to Regulus and I\u2019m sure he\u2019d want you to have it as a token of \ngratitude for what you\u2014\u201c \n\n \u201cOverkill, mate,\u201d said Ron as the elf took one look at the locket, let out a howl of \nshock and misery, and threw himself back onto the ground. \n\n It took them nearly half an hour to calm down Kreacher, who was so overcome to \nbe presented with a Black family heirloom for his very own that he was too weak at the \nknees to stand properly. When finally he was able to totter a few steps they all \naccompanied him to his cupboard, watched him tuck up the locket safely in his dirty \nblankets, and assured him that they would make its protection their first priority while he \nwas away. He then made two low bows to Harry and Ron, and even gave a funny little \nspasm in Hermione\u2019s direction that might have been an attempt at a respectful salute, \nbefore Disapparating with the usual loud crack. \n\n \n\nChapter Eleven \n\nThe Bribe \n\n \n\nIf Kreacher could escape a lake full of Inferi, Harry was confident that the capture \nof Mundungus would take a few hours at most, and he prowled the house all morning in a \nstate of high anticipation. However, Kreacher did not return that morning or even that \nafternoon. By nightfall, Harry felt discouraged and anxious, and a supper composed \nlargely of moldy bread, upon which Hermione had tried a variety of unsuccessful \nTransfigurations, did nothing to help. \n\nKreacher did not return the following day, nor the day after that. However, two \ncloaked men had appeared in the square outside number twelve, and they remained there \ninto the night, gazing in the direction of the house that they could not see. \n\n\u201cDeath Eaters, for sure,\u201d said Ron, as he, Harry, and Hermione watched from the \ndrawing room windows. \u201cReckon they know we\u2019re in here?\u201d \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d said Hermione, though she looked frightened, \u201cor they\u2019d have \nsent Snape in after us, wouldn\u2019t they?\u201d \n\n\u201cD\u2019you reckon he\u2019s been in here and has his tongue tied by Moody\u2019s curse?\u201d \nasked Ron. \n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Hermione, \u201cotherwise he\u2019d have been able to tell that lot how to get in, \nwouldn\u2019t he? But they\u2019re probably watching to see whether we turn up. They know that \nHarry owns the house, after all.\u201d \n\n\f\n\u201cHow do they --?\u201d began Harry. \n\n\u201cWizarding wills are examined by the Ministry, remember? They\u2019ll know Sirius \nleft you the place.\u201d \n\nThe presence of the Death Eaters outside increased the ominous mood inside \nnumber twelve. They had not heard a word form anyone beyond Grimmauld Place since \nMr. Weasley\u2019s Patronus, and the strain was starting to tell. Restless and irritable, Ron had \ndeveloped an annoying habit of playing with the Deluminator in his pocket; This \nparticularly infuriated Hermione, who was whiling away the wait for Kreacher by \nstudying The Tales of Beedle the Bard and did not appreciate the way the lights kept \nflashing on and off. \n\n\u201cWill you stop it!\u201d she cried on the third evening of Kreacher\u2019s absence, as all the \nlight was sucked from the drawing room yet again. \n\n\u201cSorry, sorry!\u201d said Ron, clicking the Deluminator and restoring the lights. \u201cI \ndon\u2019t know I\u2019m doing it!\u201d \n\n\u201cWell, can\u2019t you find something useful to occupy yourself?\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat, like reading kids\u2019 stories?\u201d \n\n\u201cDumbledore left me this book, Ron \u2013\u201d \n\n\u201c\u2014and he left me the Deluminator, maybe I\u2019m supposed to use it!\u201d \n\nUnable to stand the bickering, Harry slipped out of the room unnoticed by either \nof them. He headed downstairs toward the kitchen, which he kept visiting because he was \nsure that was where Kreacher was most likely to reappear. Halfway down the flight of \nstairs into the hall, however, he heard a tap on the front door, then metallic clicks and the \ngrinding of the chain. \n\nEvery nerve in his body seemed to tauten: He pulled out his wand, moved into the \nshadows beside the decapitated elf heads, and waited. The door opened: He saw a \nglimpse of the lamplit square outside, and a cloaked figure edged into the hall and closed \nthe door behind it. The intruder took a step forward, and Moody\u2019s voice asked, \u201cSeverus \nSnape?\u201d Then the dust figure rose from the end of the hall and rushed him, raising its \ndead hand. \n\n\u201cIt was not I who killed you, Albus,\u201d said a quiet voice. \n\nThe jinx broke: The dust-figure exploded again, and it was impossible to make \nout the newcomer through the dense gray cloud it left behind. \n\nHarry pointed the wand into the middle of it. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t move!\u201d \n\nHe had forgotten the portrait of Mrs. Black: At the sound of his yell, the curtains \nhiding her flew open and she began to scream, \u201cMudbloods and filth dishonoring my \nhouse \u2013\u201d \n\nRon and Hermione came crashing down the stairs behind Harry, wands pointing, \nlike his, at the unknown man now standing with his arms raised in the hall below. \n\n\u201cHold your fire, it\u2019s me, Remus!\u201d \n\n\u201cOh, thank goodness,\u201d said Hermione weakly, pointing her wand at Mrs. Black \ninstead; with a bang, the curtains swished shut again and silence fell. Ron too lowered his \nwand, but Harry did not. \n\n\u201cShow yourself!\u201d he called back. \n\nLupin moved forward into the lamplight, hands still held high in a gesture of \nsurrender. \n\n\f\n\u201cI am Remus John Lupin, werewolf, sometimes known as Moony, one of the four \ncreators of the Marauder\u2019s Map, married to Nymphadora, usually known as Tonks, and I \ntaught you how to produce a Patronus, Harry, which takes the form of a stag.\u201d \n\n\u201cOh, all right,\u201d said Harry, lowering his wand, \u201cbut I had to check, didn\u2019t I?\u201d \n\n\u201cSpeaking as your ex-Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, I quite agree that \nyou had to check. Ron, Hermione, you shouldn\u2019t be so quick to lower your defenses.\u201d \n\nThey ran down the stairs towards him. Wrapped in a thick black traveling cloak, \nhe looked exhausted, but pleased to see them. \n\n\u201cNo sign of Severus, then?\u201d he asked. \n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Is everyone okay?\u2019 \n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Lupin, \u201cbut we\u2019re all being watched. There are a couple of Death \nEaters in the square outside \u2013\u201d \n\n\u201cWe know \u2013\u201d \n\n\u201cI had to Apparate very precisely onto the top step outside the front door to be \nsure that they would not see me. They can\u2019t know you\u2019re in here or I\u2019m sure they\u2019d have \nmore people out there; they\u2019re staking out everywhere that\u2019s got any connection with you, \nHarry. Let\u2019s go downstairs, there\u2019s a lot to tell you, and I want to know what happened \nafter you left the Burrow.\u201d \n\nThey descended into the kitchen, where Hermione pointed her wand at the grate. \nA fire sprang up instantly: It gave the illusion of coziness to the stark stone walls and \nglistened off the long wooden table. Lupin pulled a few butterbeers from beneath his \ntraveling cloak and they sat down. \n\n\u201cI\u2019d have been here three days ago but I needed to shake off the Death Eater \ntailing me,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cSo, you came straight here after the wedding?\u201d \n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, \u201conly after we ran into a couple of Death Eaters in a caf\u00e9 on \nTottenham Court Road.\u201d \n\nLupin slopped most of his butterbeer down his front. \n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d \n\nThey explained what had happened; when they had finished, Lupin looked aghast. \n\n\u201cBut how did they find you so quickly? It\u2019s impossible to track anyone who \nApparates, unless you grab hold of them as they disappear.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t seem likely they were just strolling down Tottenham Court Road \nat the time, does it?\u201d said Harry. \n\n\u201cWe wondered,\u201d said Hermione tentatively, \u201cwhether Harry could still have the \nTrace on him?\u201d \n\n\u201cImpossible,\u201d said Lupin. Ron looked smug, and Harry felt hugely relieved. \n\u201cApart from anything else, they\u2019d know for sure Harry was here if he still had the Trace \non him, wouldn\u2019t they? But I can\u2019t see how they could have tracked you to Tottenham \nCourt Road, that\u2019s worrying, really worrying.\u201d \n\nHe looked disturbed, but as far as Harry was concerned, that question could wait. \n\n\u201cTell us what happened after we left, we haven\u2019t heard a thing since Ron\u2019s dad \ntold us the family was safe.\u201d \n\n\u201cWell, Kingsley saved us,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cThanks to his warning most of the \nwedding guests were able to Disapparate before they arrived.\u201d \n\n\u201cWere they Death Eaters or Ministry people?\u201d interjected Hermione. \n\n\f\n\u201cA mixture; but to all intents and purposes they\u2019re the same thing now,\u201d said \nLupin. \u201cThere were about a dozen of them, but they didn\u2019t know you were there, Harry. \nArthur heard a rumor that they tried to torture your whereabouts out of Scrimgeour before \nthey killed him; if it\u2019s true, he didn\u2019t give you away.\u201d \n\nHarry looked at Ron and Hermione; their expressions reflected the mingled shock \nand gratitude he felt. He had never liked Scrimgeour much, but if what Lupin said was \ntrue, the man\u2019s final act had been to try to protect Harry. \n\n\u201cThe Death Eaters searched the Burrow from top to bottom,\u201d Lupin went on. \n\u201cThey found the ghoul, but didn\u2019t want to get too close \u2013 and then they interrogated those \nof us who remained for hours. They were trying to get information on you, Harry, but of \ncourse nobody apart from the Order knew that you had been there. \n\n\u201cAt the same time that they were smashing up the wedding, more Death Eaters \nwere forcing their way into every Order-connected house in the country. No deaths,\u201d he \nadded quickly, forestalling the question, \u201cbut they were rough. They burned down \nDedalus Diggle\u2019s house, but as you know he wasn\u2019t there, and they used the Cruciarus \nCurse on Tonks\u2019s family. Again, trying to find out where you went after you visited them. \nThey\u2019re all right \u2013 shaken, obviously, but otherwise okay.\u201d \n\n\u201cThe Death Eaters got through all those protective charms?\u201d \n\nHarry asked, remembering how effective these had been on the night he had \ncrashed in Tonks\u2019s parents\u2019 garden. \n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019ve got to realize, Harry, is that the Death Eaters have got the full \nmight of the Ministry on their side now,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cThey\u2019ve got the power to perform \nbrutal spells without fear of identification or arrest. They managed to penetrate every \ndefensive spell we\u2019d cast against them, and once inside, they were completely open about \nwhy they\u2019d come.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd are they bothering to give an excuse for torturing Harry\u2019s whereabouts out \nof people?\u201d asked Hermione, an edge to her voice. \n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Lupin said. He hesitated, then pulled out a folded copy of the Daily \nProphet. \n\n\u201cHere,\u201d he said, pushing it across the table to Harry, \u201cyou\u2019ll know sooner or later \nanyway. That\u2019s their pretext for going after you.\u201d \n\nHarry smoothed out the paper. A huge photograph of his own face filled the front \npage. He read the headline over it: \n\n \n\n WANTED FOR QUESTIONING ABOUT \n\n THE DEATH OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE \n\n \n\nRon and Hermione gave roars of outrage, but Harry said nothing. He pushed the \nnewspaper away; he did not want to read anymore: He knew what it would say. Nobody \nbut those who had been on top of the tower when Dumbledore died knew who had really \nkilled him and, as Rita Skeeter had already told the Wizarding world, Harry had been \nseen running from the place moments after Dumbledore had fallen. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Harry,\u201d Lupin said. \n\n\u201cSo Death Eaters have taken over the Daily Prophet too?\u201d asked Hermione \nfuriously. \n\nLupin nodded. \n\n\f\n\u201cBut surely people realize what\u2019s going on?\u201d \n\n\u201cThe coup has been smooth and virtually silent,\u201d said Lupin. \n\n\u201cThe official version of Scrimgeour\u2019s murder is that he resigned; he has been \nreplaced by Pius Thicknesse, who is under the Imperius Curse.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t Voldemort declare himself Minister of Magic?\u201d asked Ron. \n\nLupin laughed. \n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t need to, Ron. Effectively, he is the Minister, but why should he sit \nbehind a desk at the Ministry? His puppet, Thicknesse, is taking care of everyday \nbusiness, leaving Voldemort free to extend his power beyond the Ministry. \n\n\u201cNaturally many people have deduced what has happened: There has been such a \ndramatic change in Ministry policy in the last few days, and many are whispering that \nVoldemort must be behind it. However, that is the point: They whisper. They daren\u2019t \nconfide in each other, not knowing whom to trust; they are scared to speak out, in case \ntheir suspicions are true and their families are targeted. Yes, Voldemort is playing a very \nclever game. Declaring himself might have provoked open rebellion: Remaining masked \nhas created confusion, uncertainty, and fear.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd this dramatic change in Ministry policy,\u201d said Harry, \u201cinvolves warning the \nWizarding world against me instead of Voldemort?\u201d \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s certainly a part of it,\u201d said Lupin, \u201cand it is a masterstroke. Now that \nDumbledore is dead, you \u2013 the Boy Who Lived \u2013 were sure to be the symbol and rallying \npoint for any resistance to Voldemort. But by suggesting that you had a hand in the old \nhat\u2019s death, Voldemort has not only set a price upon your head, but sown doubt and fear \namongst many who would have defended you. \n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the Ministry has started moving against Muggle-borns.\u201d \n\nLupin pointed at the Daily Prophet. \n\n\u201cLook at page two.\u201d \n\nHermione turned the pages with much the same expression of distaste she had \nwhen handling Secrets of the Darkest Art. \n\n\u201cMuggle-born Register!\u201d she read aloud. \u201c\u2018The Ministry of Magic is undertaking \na survey of so-called \u201cMuggle-borns\u201d the better to understand how they came to possess \nmagical secrets. \n\n\u201c\u2018Recent research undertaken by the Department of Mysteries reveals that magic \ncan only be passed from person to person when Wizards reproduce. Where no proven \nWizarding ancestry exists, therefore, the so-called Muggle-born is likely to have obtained \nmagical power by theft or force. \n\n\u201c\u2018The Ministry is determined to root out such usurpers of magical power, and to \nthis end has issued an invitation to every so-called Muggle-born to present themselves for \ninterview by the newly appointed Muggle-born Registration Commission.\u2019\u201d \n\n\u201cPeople won\u2019t let this happen,\u201d said Ron. \n\n\u201cIt is happening, Ron,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cMuggle-borns are being rounded up as we \nspeak.\u201d \n\n\u201cBut how are they supposed to have \u2018stolen\u2019 magic?\u201d said Ron. \u201cIt\u2019s mental, if \nyou could steal magic there wouldn\u2019t be any Squibs, would there?\u201d \n\n\u201cI know,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cNevertheless, unless you can prove that you have at least \none close Wizarding relative, you are now deemed to have obtained your magical power \nillegally and must suffer the punishment.\u201d \n\n\f\nRon glanced at Hermione, then said, \u201cWhat if purebloods and halfbloods swear a \nMuggle-born\u2019s part of their family? I\u2019ll tell everyone Hermione\u2019s my cousin \u2013\u201d \n\nHermione covered Ron\u2019s hand with hers and squeezed it. \n\n\u201cThank you, Ron, but I couldn\u2019t let you \u2013\u201d \n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t have a choice,\u201d said Ron fiercely, gripping her hand back. \u201cI\u2019ll teach \nyou my family tree so you can answer questions on it.\u201d \n\nHermione gave a shaky laugh. \n\n\u201cRon, as we\u2019re on the run with Harry Potter, the most wanted person in the \ncountry, I don\u2019t think it matters. If I was going back to school it would be different. \nWhat\u2019s Voldemort planning for Hogwarts?\u201d she asked Lupin. \n\n\u201cAttendance is now compulsory for every young witch and wizard,\u201d he replied. \n\u201cThat was announced yesterday. It\u2019s a change, because it was never obligatory before. Of \ncourse, nearly every witch and wizard in Britain has been educated at Hogwarts, but their \nparents had the right to teach them at home or send them abroad if they preferred. This \nway, Voldemort will have the whole Wizarding population under his eye from a young \nage. And it\u2019s also another way of weeding out Muggle-borns, because students must be \ngiven Blood Status \u2013 meaning that they have proven to the Ministry that they are of \nWizard descent \u2013 before they are allowed to attend.\u201d \n\nHarry felt sickened and angry: At this moment, excited eleven-year-olds would be \nporing over stacks of newly purchased spell-books, unaware that they would never see \nHogwarts, perhaps never see their families again either. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s . . . it\u2019s . . .\u201d he muttered, struggling to find words that did justice to the \nhorror of his thoughts, but Lupin said quietly, \n\n\u201cI know.\u201d \n\nLupin hesitated. \n\nI\u2019ll understand if you can\u2019t confirm this, Harry, but the Order is under the \nimpression that Dumbledore left you a mission.\u201d \n\n\u201cHe did,\u201d Harry replied, \u201cand Ron and Hermione are in on it and they\u2019re coming \nwith me.\u201d \n\n\u201cCan you confide in me what the mission is?\u201d \n\nHarry looked into the prematurely lined face, framed in thick but graying hair, \nand wished that he could return a different answer. \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t, Remus, I\u2019m sorry. If Dumbledore didn\u2019t tell you I don\u2019t think I can.\u201d \n\n\u201cI thought you\u2019d say that,\u201d said Lupin, looking disappointed. \u201cBut I might still be \nof some use to you. You know what I am and what I can do. I could come with you to \nprovide protection. There would be no need to tell me exactly what you were up to.\u201d \n\nHarry hesitated. It was a very tempting offer, though how they would be able to \nkeep their mission secret from Lupin if he were with them all the time he could not \nimagine. \n\nHermione, however, looked puzzled. \n\n\u201cBut what about Tonks?\u201d she asked. \n\n\u201cWhat about her?\u201d said Lupin. \n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Hermione, frowning, \u201cyou\u2019re married! How does she feel about you \ngoing away with us?\u201d \n\n\u201cTonks will be perfectly safe,\u201d said Lupin, \u201cShe\u2019ll be at her parents\u2019 house.\u201d \n\n\f\nThere was something strange in Lupin\u2019s tone, it was almost cold. There was also \nsomething odd in the idea of Tonks remaining hidden at her parents\u2019 house; she was, after \nall, a member of the Order and, as far as Harry knew, was likely to want to be in the thick \nof the action. \n\n\u201cRemus,\u201d said Hermione tentatively, \u201cis everything all right . . . you know . . . \nbetween you and \u2013 \u201d \n\n\u201cEverything is fine, thank you,\u201d said Lupin pointedly. \n\nHermione turned pink. There was another pause, an awkward and embarrassed \none, and then Lupin said, with an air of forcing himself to admit something unpleasant, \n\u201cTonks is going to have a baby.\u201d \n\n\u201cOh, how wonderful!\u201d squealed Hermione. \n\n\u201cExcellent!\u201d said Ron enthusiastically. \n\n\u201cCongratulations,\u201d said Harry. \n\nLupin gave an artificial smile that was more like a grimace, then said, \u201cSo . . . do \nyou accept my offer? Will three become four? I cannot believe that Dumbledore would \nhave disapproved, he appointed me your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, after all. \nAnd I must tell you that I believe we are facing magic many of us have never \nencountered or imagined.\u201d \n\nRon and Hermione both looked at Harry. \n\n\u201cJust \u2013 just to be clear,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want to leave Tonks at her parents\u2019 house \nand come away with us?\u201d \n\n\u201cShe\u2019ll be perfectly safe there, they\u2019ll look after her,\u201d said Lupin. He spoke with a \nfinality bordering on indifference: \u201cHarry, I\u2019m sure James would have wanted me to stick \nwith you.\u201d \n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Harry slowly, \u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m pretty sure my father would have wanted \nto know why you aren\u2019t sticking with your own kid, actually.\u201d \n\nLupin\u2019s face drained of color. The temperature in the kitchen might have dropped \nten degrees. Ron stared around the room as though he had been bidden to memorize it, \nwhile Hermione\u2019s eyes swiveled backward and forward from Harry to Lupin. \n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d said Lupin at last. \n\n\u201cExplain, then,\u201d said Harry. \n\nLupin swallowed. \n\n\u201cI \u2013 I made a grave mistake in marrying Tonks. I did it against my better \njudgment and have regretted it very much every since.\u201d \n\n\u201cI see,\u201d said Harry, \u201cso you\u2019re just going to dump her and the kid and run off with \nus?\u201d \n\nLupin sprang to his feet: His chair toppled over backward, and he glared at them \nso fiercely that Harry saw, for the first time ever, she shadow of the wolf upon his human \nface. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you understand what I\u2019ve done to my wife and my unborn child? I should \nnever have married her, I\u2019ve made her an outcast!\u201d \n\nLupin kicked aside the chair he had overturned. \n\n\u201cYou have only ever seen me amongst the Order, or under Dumbledore\u2019s \nprotection at Hogwarts! You don\u2019t know how most of the Wizarding world sees creatures \nlike me! When they know of my affliction, they can barely talk to me! Don\u2019t you see \nwhat I\u2019ve done? \n\n\f\nEven her own family is disgusted by our marriage, what parents want their only \ndaughter to marry a werewolf? And the child \u2013 the child \u2013 \u201d \n\nLupin actually seized handfuls of his own hair; he looked quite deranged. \n\n\u201cMy kind don\u2019t usually breed! It will be like me, I am convinced of it \u2013 how can I \nforgive myself, when I knowingly risked passing on my own condition to an innocent \nchild? And if, by some miracle, it is not like me, then it will be better off, a hundred times \nso, without a father of whom it must always be ashamed!\u201d \n\n\u201cRemus!\u201d whispered Hermione, tears in her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t say that \u2013 how could \nany child be ashamed of you?\u201d \n\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know, Hermione,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI\u2019d be pretty ashamed of him.\u201d \n\nHarry did not know where his rage was coming from, but it had propelled him to \nhis feet too. Lupin looked as though Harry had hit him. \n\n\u201cIf the new regime thinks Muggle-borns are bad,\u201d Harry said, \u201cwhat will they do \nto a half-werewolf whose father\u2019s in the Order? My father died trying to protect my \nmother and me, and you reckon he\u2019d tell you to abandon your kid to go on an adventure \nwith us?\u201d \n\n\u201cHow \u2013 how dare you?\u201d said Lupin. \u201cThis is not about a desire for \u2013 for danger or \npersonal glory \u2013 how dare you suggest such a \u2013 \u201d \n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re feeling a bit of a daredevil,\u201d Harry said, \u201cYou fancy stepping into \nSirius\u2019s shoes \u2013\u201d \n\n\u201cHarry, no!\u201d Hermione begged him, but he continued to glare into Lupin\u2019s livid \nface. \n\n\u201cI\u2019d never have believed this,\u201d Harry said. \u201cThe man who taught me to fight \ndementors \u2013 a coward.\u201d \n\nLupin drew his wand so fast that Harry had barely reached for his own; there was \na loud bang and he felt himself flying backward as if punched; as he slammed into the \nkitchen wall and slid to the floor, he glimpsed the tail of Lupin\u2019s cloak disappearing \naround the door. \n\n\u201cRemus, Remus, come back!\u201d Hermione cried, but Lupin did not respond. A \nmoment later they heard the front door slam. \n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d wailed Hermione. \u201cHow could you?\u201d \n\n\u201cIt was easy,\u201d said Harry. He stood up, he could feel a lump swelling where his \nhead had hit the wall. He was still so full of anger he was shaking. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that!\u201d he snapped at Hermione. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you start on her!\u201d snarled Ron. \n\n\u201cNo \u2013 no \u2013 we mustn\u2019t fight!\u201d said Hermione, launching herself between them. \n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have said that stuff to Lupin,\u201d Ron told Harry. \n\n\u201cHe had it coming to him,\u201d said Harry. Broken images were racing each other \nthrough his mind: Sirius falling through the veil; Dumbledore suspended, broken, in \nmidair; a flash of green light and his mother\u2019s voice, begging for mercy . . . \n\n\u201cParents,\u201d said Harry, \u201cshouldn\u2019t leave their kids unless \u2013 unless they\u2019ve got to.\u201d \n\n\u201cHarry \u2013\u201c said Hermione, stretching out a consoling hand, but he shrugged it off \nand walked away, his eyes on the fire Hermione had conjured. He had once spoken to \nLupin out of that fireplace, seeking reassurance about James, and Lupin had consoled \nhim. Now Lupin\u2019s tortured white face seemed to swim in the air before him. He felt a \n\n\f\nsickening surge of remorse. Neither Ron nor Hermione spoke, but Harry felt sure that \nthey were looking at each other behind his back, communicating silently. \n\nHe turned around and caught them turning hurriedly away form each other. \n\n\u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t have called him a coward.\u201d \n\n\u201cNo, you shouldn\u2019t,\u201d said Ron at once. \n\n\u201cBut he\u2019s acting like one.\u201d \n\n\u201cAll the same . . .\u201d said Hermione. \n\n\u201cI know,\u201d said Harry. \u201cBut if it makes him go back to Tonks, it\u2019ll be worth it, \nwon\u2019t it?\u201d \n\nHe could not keep the plea out of his voice. Hermione looked sympathetic, Ron \nuncertain. Harry looked down at his feet, thinking of his father. Would James have \nbacked Harry in what he had said to Lupin, or would he have been angry at how his son \nhad treated his old friend? \n\nThe silent kitchen seemed to hum with the shock of the recent scene and with Ron \nand Hermione\u2019s unspoken reproaches. The Daily Prophet Lupin had brought was still \nlying on the table, Harry\u2019s own face staring up at the ceiling from the front page. He \nwalked over to it and sat down, opened the paper at random, and pretended to read. He \ncould not take in the words; his mind was still too full of the encounter with Lupin. He \nwas sure that Ron and Hermione had resumed their silent communications on the other \nside of the Prophet. He turned a page loudly, and Dumbledore\u2019s name leapt out at him. It \nwas a moment or two before he took in the meaning of the photograph, which showed a \nfamily group. Beneath the photograph were the words: The Dumbledore family, left to \nright: Albus; Percival, holding newborn Ariana; Kendra, and Aberforth. \n\nHis attention caught, Harry examined the picture more carefully. Dumbledore\u2019s \nfather, Percival, was a good-looking man with eyes that seemed to twinkle even in this \nfaded old photograph. The baby, Ariana, was a little longer than a loaf of bread and no \nmore distinctive-looking. The mother, Kendra, had jet black hair pulled into a high bun. \nHer face had a carved quality about it. Harry thought of photos of Native Americans he\u2019d \nseen as he studied her dark eyes, high cheekbones, and straight nose, formally composed \nabove a high-necked silk gown. Albus and Aberforth wore matching lacy collared jackets \nand had identical, shoulder-length hairstyles. Albus looked several years older, but \notherwise the two boys looked very alike, for this was before Albus\u2019s nose had been \nbroken and before he started wearing glasses. \n\nThe family looked quite happy and normal, smiling serenely up out of the \nnewspaper. Baby Ariana\u2019s arm waved vaguely out of her shawl. Harry looked above the \npicture and saw the headline: \n\n \n\n EXCLUSIVE EXTRACT FROM UPCOMING \n\n BIOGRAPHY OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE \n\n by Rita Skeeter \n\n \n\nThinking it could hardly make him feel any worse than he already did, Harry \nbegan to read: \n\n \n\n\f\nProud and haughty, Kendra Dumbledore could not bear to remain in Mould-on-the-\nWold after her husband Percival\u2019s well-publicized arrest and imprisonment in \nAzkaban. She therefore decided to uproot the family and relocate to Godric\u2019s Hollow, \nthe village that was later to gain fame as the scene of Harry Potter\u2019s strange escape \nfrom You-Know-Who. \n\n Like Mould-on-the-Wold, Godric\u2019s Hollow was home to a number of Wizarding \nfamilies, but as Kendra knew none of them, she would be spared the curiosity about \nher husband\u2019s crime she had faced in her former village. By repeatedly rebuffing the \nfriendly advances of her new Wizarding neighbors, she soon ensured that her family \nwas left well alone. \n\n \u201cSlammed the door in my face when I went around to welcome her with a batch \nof homemade Cauldron Cakes,\u201d says Bathilda Bagshot. \u201cThe first year they were \nthere I only ever saw the two boys. Wouldn\u2019t have known there was a daughter if I \nhadn\u2019t been picking Plangentines by moonlight the winter after they moved in, and \nsaw Kendra leading Ariana out into the back garden. Walked her round the lawn once, \nkeeping a firm grip on her, then took her back inside. Didn\u2019t know what to make of \nit.\u201d \n\n It seems that Kendra thought the move to Godric\u2019s Hollow was the perfect \nopportunity to hide Ariana once and for all, something she had probably been \nplanning for years. The timing was significant. Ariana was barely seven years old \nwhen she vanished from sight, and seven is the age by which most experts agree that \nmagic will have revealed itself, if present. Nobody now alive remembers Ariana ever \ndemonstrating even the slightest sign of magical ability. It seems clear, therefore, that \nKendra made a decision to hide her daughter\u2019s existence rather than suffer the shame \nof admitting that she had produced a Squib. Moving away from the friends and \nneighbors who knew Ariana would, of course, make imprisoning her all the easier. \nThe tiny number of people who henceforth knew of Ariana\u2019s existence could be \ncounted upon to keep the secret, including her two brothers, who had deflected \nawkward questions with the answer their mother had taught them. \u201cMy sister is too \nfrail for school.\u201d \n\n Next week: Albus Dumbledore at Hogwarts \u2013 the Prizes and the Pretense. \n\n \n\n Harry had been wrong: What he had read had indeed made him feel worse. He \nlooked back at the photograph of the apparently happy family. Was it true? How could he \nfind out? He wanted to go to Godric\u2019s Hollow, even if Bathilda was in no fit state to talk \nto him: he wanted to visit the place where he and Dumbledore had both lost loved ones. \nHe was in the process of lowering the newspaper, to ask Ron\u2019s and Hermione\u2019s opinions, \nwhen a deafening crack echoed around the kitchen. \n\n For the first time in three days Harry had forgotten all about Kreacher. His \nimmediate thought was that Lupin had burst back into the room, and for a split second, he \ndid not take in the mass of struggling limbs that had appeared out of thin air right beside \nhis chair. He hurried to his feet as Kreacher disentangled himself and, bowing low to \nHarry, croaked, \u201cKreacher has returned with the thief Mundungus Fletcher, Master.\u201d \n\n Mundungus scrambled up and pulled out his wand; Hermione, however, was too \nquick for him. \n\n \u201cExpelliarmus!\u201d \n\n\f\n Mundungus\u2019s wand soared into the air, and Hermione caught it. Wild-eyed, \nMundungus dived for the stairs. Ron rugby-tackled him and Mundungus hit the stone \nfloor with a muffled crunch. \n\n \u201cWhat?\u201d he bellowed, writhing in his attempts to free himself from Ron\u2019s grip. \n\u201cWha\u2019ve I done? Setting a bleedin\u2019 \u2018house-elf on me, what are you playing at, wha\u2019ve I \ndone, lemme go, lemme go, of \u2013 \u201d \n\n \u201cYou\u2019re not in much of a position to make threats,\u201d said Harry. He threw aside \nthe newspaper, crossed the kitchen in a few strides, and dropped to his knees beside \nMundungus, who stopped struggling and looked terrified. Ron got up, panting, and \nwatched as Harry pointed his wand deliberately at Mundungus\u2019s nose. Mundungus stank \nof stale sweat and tobacco smoke. His hair was matted and his robes stained. \n\n \u201cKreacher apologizes for the delay in bringing the thief, Master,\u201d croaked the elf. \n\u201cFletcher knows how to avoid capture, has many hidey-holes and accomplices. \nNevertheless, Kreacher cornered the thief in the end.\u201d \n\n \u201cYou\u2019ve done really well, Kreacher,\u201d said Harry, and the elf bowed low. \n\n \u201cRight, we\u2019ve got a few questions for you,\u201d Harry told Mundungus, who shouted \nat once. \n\n \u201cI panicked, okay? I never wanted to come along, no offense, mate, but I never \nvolunteered to die for you, an\u2019 that was bleedin\u2019 You-Know-Who come flying at me, \nanyone woulda got outta there. I said all along I didn\u2019t wanna do it \u2013\u201d \n\n \u201cFor your information, none of the rest of us Disapparated,\u201d said Hermione. \n\n \u201cWell, you\u2019re a bunch of bleedin\u2019 \u2018eroes then, aren\u2019t you, but I never pretended I \nwas up for killing meself \u2013\u201d \n\n \u201cWe\u2019re not interested in why you ran out on Mad-Eye,\u201d said Harry, moving his \nwand a little closer to Mundungus\u2019s baggy, bloodshot eyes. \u201cWe already knew you were \nan unreliable bit of scum.\u201d \n\n \u201cWell then, why the \u2018ell am I being \u2018unted down by \u2018ouse-elves? Or is this about \nthem goblets again? I ain\u2019t got none of \u2018em left, or you could \u2018ave \u2018em \u2013\u201d \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s not about the goblets either, although you\u2019re getting warmer,\u201d said Harry. \n\u201cShut up and listen.\u201d \n\n It felt wonderful to have something to do, someone of whom he could demand \nsome small portion of truth. Harry\u2019s wand was now so close to the bridge of \nMundungus\u2019s nose that Mundungus had gone cross-eyed trying to keep it in view. \n\n \u201cWhen you cleaned out this house of anything valuable,\u201d Harry began, but \nMundungus interrupted him again. \n\n \u201cSirius never cared about any of the junk \u2013\u201d \n\n There was the sound of pattering fee, a blaze of shining copper, an echoing clang, \nand a shriek of agony; Kreacher had taken a run at Mundungus and hit him over the head \nwith a saucepan. \n\n \u201cCall \u2018im off, call \u2018im off, \u2018e should be locked up!\u201d screamed Mundungus, \ncowering as Kreacher raised the heavy-bottomed pan again. \n\n \u201cKreacher, no!\u201d shouted Harry. \n\n Kreacher\u2019s thin arms trembled with the weight of the pan, still held aloft. \n\n \u201cPerhaps just one more, Master Harry, for luck?\u201d \n\n Ron laughed. \n\n\f\n \u201cWe need him conscious, Kreacher, but if he needs persuading, you can do the \nhonors,\u201d said Harry. \n\n \u201cThank you very much, Master,\u201d said Kreacher with a bow, and he retreated a \nshort distance, his great pale eyes still fixed upon Mundungus with loathing. \n\n \u201cWhen you stripped this house of all the valuables you could find,\u201d Harry began \nagain, \u201cyou took a bunch of stuff from the kitchen cupboard. There was a locket there.\u201d \nHarry\u2019s mouth was suddenly dry: He could sense Ron and Hermione\u2019s tension and \nexcitement too. \u201cWhat did you do with it?\u201d \n\n \u201cWhy?\u201d asked Mundungus. \u201cIs it valuable?\u201d \n\n \u201cYou\u2019ve still got it!\u201d cried Hermione. \n\n \u201cNo, he hasn\u2019t,\u201d said Ron shrewdly. \u201cHe\u2019s wondering whether he should have \nasked more money for it.\u201d \n\n \u201cMore?\u201d said Mundungus. \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t have been effing difficult . . .bleedin\u2019 \ngave it away, di\u2019n\u2019 I? No choice.\u201d \n\n \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \n\n \u201cI was selling in Diagon Alley and she come up to me and asks if I\u2019ve got a \nlicense for trading in magical artifacts. Bleedin\u2019 snoop. She was gonna fine me, but she \ntook a fancy to the locket an\u2019 told me she\u2019d take it and let me off that time, and to fink \nmeself lucky.\u201d \n\n \u201cWho was this woman?\u201d asked Harry. \n\n \u201cI dunno, some Ministry hag.\u201d \n\n Mundungus considered for a moment, brow wrinkled. \n\n \u201cLittle woman. Bow on top of \u2018er head.\u201d \n\n He frowned and then added, \u201cLooked like a toad.\u201d \n\n Harry dropped his wand: It hit Mundungus on the nose and shot red sparks into \nhis eyebrows, which ignited. \n\n \u201cAquamenti!\u201d screamed Hermione, and a jet of water streamed from her wand, \nengulfing a spluttering and choking Mundungus. \n\n Harry looked up and saw his own shock reflected in Ron\u2019s and Hermione\u2019s faces. \nThe scars on the back of his right hand seemed to be tingling again. \n\n \n\nChapter Twelve \n\nMagic is Might \n\n \n\n As August wore on, the square of unkempt grass in the middle of Grimmauld \nPlace shriveled in the sun until it was brittle and brown. The inhabitants of number \ntwelve were never seen by anyone in the surrounding houses, and nor was number twelve \nitself. The muggles who lived in Grimmauld Place had long since accepted the amusing \nmistake in the numbering that had caused number eleven to sit beside number thirteen. \n\n And yet the square was now attracting a trickle of visitors who seemed to find the \nanomaly most intriguing. Barely a day passed without one or two people arriving in \nGrimmauld Place with no other purpose, or so it seemed, than to lean against the railings \nfacing numbers eleven and thirteen, watching the join between the two houses. The \nlurkers were never the same two days running, although they all seemed to share a dislike \n\n\f\nfor normal clothing. Most of the Londoners who passed them were used to eccentric \ndressers and took little notice, though occasionally one of them might glance back, \nwondering why anyone would wear cloaks in this heat. \n\n The watchers seemed to be gleaning little satisfaction from their vigil. \nOccasionally one of them started forward excitedly, as if they had seen something \ninteresting at last, only to fall back looking disappointed. \n\n On the first day of September there were more people lurking in the square than \never before. Half a dozen men in long cloaks stood silent and watchful, gazing as ever at \nhouses eleven and thirteen, but the thing for which they were waiting still appeared \nelusive. As evening drew in, bringing with it an unexpected gust of chilly rain for the first \ntime in weeks, there occurred one of those inexplicable moments when they appeared to \nhave seen something interesting. The man with the twisted face pointed and his closest \ncompanion, a podgy, pallid man, started forward, but a moment later they had relaxed \ninto their previous state of inactivity, looking frustrated and disappointed. \n\n Meanwhile, inside number twelve, Harry had just entered the hall. He had nearly \nlost his balance as he Apparated onto the top step just outside the front door, and thought \nthat the Death Eaters might have caught a glimpse of his momentarily exposed elbow. \nShutting the front door carefully behind him, he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak, draped \nit over his arm, and hurried along the gloomy hallway toward the door that led to the \nbasement, a stolen copy of the Daily Prophet clutched in his hand. \n\n The usual low whisper of \u201cSeverus Snape\u201d greeted him, the chill wind swept him, \nand his tongue rolled up for a moment. \n\n \u201cI didn\u2019t kill you,\u201d he said, once it had unrolled, then held his breath as the dusty \njinx-figure exploded. He waited until he was halfway down the stairs to the kitchen, out \nof earshot of Mrs. Black and clear of the dust cloud, before calling, \u201cI\u2019ve got news, and \nyou won\u2019t like it.\u201d \n\n The kitchen was almost unrecognizable. Every surface now shone; Copper pots \nand pans had been burnished to a rosy glow; the wooden tabletop gleamed; the goblets \nand plates already laid for dinner glinted in the light from a merrily blazing fire, on which \na cauldron was simmering. Nothing in the room, however, was more dramatically \ndifferent than the house-elf who now came hurrying toward Harry, dressed in a snowy-\nwhite towel, his ear hair as clean and fluffy as cotton wool, Regulus\u2019s locket bouncing on \nhis thin chest. \n\n \u201cShoes off, if you please, Master Harry, and hands washed before dinner,\u201d \ncroaked Kreacher, seizing the Invisibility Cloak and slouching off to hang it on a hook on \nthe wall, beside a number of old-fashioned robes that had been freshly laundered. \n\n \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d Ron asked apprehensively. He are Hermione had been \npouring over a sheaf of scribbled notes and hand drawn maps that littered the end of the \nlong kitchen table, but now they watched Harry as he strode toward them and threw down \nthe newspaper on top of their scattered parchment. \n\n A large picture of a familiar, hook-nosed, black-haired man stared up at them all, \nbeneath a headline that read: \n\n \n\n SEVERUS SNAPE CONFIRMED AS HOGWARTS HEADMASTER \n\n \n\n \u201cNo!\u201d said Ron and Hermione loudly. \n\n\f\n Hermione was quickest; she snatched up the newspaper and began to read the \naccompanying story out loud. \n\n \u201cSeverus Snape, long-standing Potions master at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft \nand wizardry, was today appointed headmaster in the most important of several staffing \nchanges at the ancient school. Following the resignation of the previous Muggle Studies \nteacher, Alecto Carrow will take over the post while her brother, Amycus, fills the \nposition of Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.\u201d \n\n \u201c \u2018I welcome the opportunity to uphold our finest Wizarding traditions and values \n\u2013\u2018 Like committing murder and cutting off people\u2019s ears, I suppose! Snape, headmaster! \nSnape in Dumbledore\u2019s study \u2013 Merlin\u2019s pants!\u201d she shrieked, making both Harry and \nRon jump. She leapt up from the table and hurtled from the room, shouting as she went, \n\u201cI\u2019ll be back in a minute!\u201d \n\n \u201c\u2019Merlin\u2019s pants\u2019?\u201d repeated Ron, looking amused. \u201cShe must be upset.\u201d He \npulled the newspaper toward him and perused the article about Snape. \n\n \u201cThe other teachers won\u2019t stand for this, McGonagall and Flitwick and Sprout all \nknow the truth, they know how Dumbledore died. They won\u2019t accept Snape as \nheadmaster. And who are these Carrows?\u201d \n\n \u201cDeath Eaters,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThere are pictures of them inside. They were at the \ntop of the tower when Snape killed Dumbledore, so it\u2019s all friends together. And,\u201d Harry \nwent on bitterly, drawing up a chair, \u201cI can\u2019t see that the other teachers have got any \nchoice but to stay. If the Ministry and Voldemort are behind Snape it\u2019ll be a choice \nbetween staying and teaching, or a nice few years in Azkaban \u2013 and that\u2019s if they\u2019re \nlucky. I reckon they\u2019ll stay to try and protect the students.\u201d \n\n Kreacher came bustling to the table with a large curcen in his hands, and ladled \nout soup into pristine bowls, whistling between his teeth as he did so. \n\n \u201cThanks, Kreacher,\u201d said Harry, flipping over the Prophet so as not to have to \nlook at Snape\u2019s face. \u201cWell, at least we know exactly where Snape is now.\u201d \n\n He began to spoon soup into his mouth. The quality of Kreacher\u2019s cooking had \nimproved dramatically ever since he had been given Regulus\u2019s locket: Today\u2019s French \nonion was as good as Harry had ever tasted. \n\n \u201cThere are still a load of Death Eaters watching this house,\u201d he told Ron as he ate, \n\u201cmore than usual. It\u2019s like they\u2019re hoping we\u2019ll march out carrying our school trunks and \nhead off for the Hogwarts Express.\u201d \n\n Ron glanced at his watch. \n\n \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about that all day. It left nearly six hours ago. Weird, not \nbeing on it, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \n\n In his mind\u2019s eye Harry seemed to see the scarlet steam engine as he and Ron had \nonce followed it by air, shimmering between fields and hills, a rippling scarlet caterpillar. \nHe was sure Ginny, Neville, and Luna were sitting together at this moment, perhaps \nwondering where he, Ron, and Hermione were, or debating how best to undermine \nSnape\u2019s new regime. \n\n \u201cThey nearly saw me coming back in just now,\u201d Harry said, \u201cI landed badly on \nthe top step, and the Cloak slipped.\u201d \n\n \u201cI do that every time. Oh, here she is,\u201d Ron added, craning around in his seat to \nwatch Hermione reentering the kitchen. \u201cAnd what in the name of Merlin\u2019s most baggy \nY Fronts was that about?\u201d \n\n\f\n \u201cI remembered this,\u201d Hermione panted. \n\n She was carrying a large, framed picture, which she now lowered to the floor \nbefore seizing her small, beaded bag from the kitchen sideboard. Opening it, she \nproceeded to force the painting inside and despite the fact that it was patently too large to \nfit inside the tiny bag, within a few seconds it had vanished, like so much ease, into the \nbag\u2019s capacious depths. \n\n \u201cPhineas Nigellus,\u201d Hermione explained as she threw the bag onto the kitchen \ntable with the usual sonorous, clanking crash. \n\n \u201cSorry?\u201d said Ron, but Harry understood. The painted image of Phineas Nigellus \nBlack was able to travel between his portrait in Grimmauld Place and the one that hung in \nthe headmaster\u2019s office at Hogwarts: the circular cower-top room where Snape was no \ndoubt sitting right now, in triumphant possession of Dumbledore\u2019s collection of delicate, \nsilver magical instruments, the stone Pensieve, the Sorting Hat and, unless it ad been \nmoved elsewhere, the sword of Gryffindor. \n\n \u201cSnape could send Phineas Nigellus to look inside this house for him,\u201d Hermione \nexplained to Ron as she resumed her seat. \u201cBut let him try it now, all Phineas Nigellus \nwill be able to see is the inside of my handbag.\u201d \n\n \u201cGood thinking!\u201d said Ron, looking impressed. \n\n \u201cThank you,\u201d smiled Hermione, pulling her soup toward her. \u201cSo, Harry, what \nelse happened today?\u201d \n\n \u201cNothing,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWatched the Ministry entrance for seven hours. No sign \nof her. Saw your dad though, Ron. He looks fine.\u201d \n\n Ron nodded his appreciation of this news. The had agreed that it was far too \ndangerous to try and communicate with Mr. Weasley while he walked in and out of the \nMinistry, because he was always surrounded by other Ministry workers. It was, however, \nreassuring to catch these glimpses of him, even if he did look very strained and anxious. \n\n \u201cDad always told us most Ministry people use the Floo Network to get to work,\u201d \nRon said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we haven\u2019t seen Umbridge, she\u2019d never walk, she\u2019d think she\u2019s \ntoo important.\u201d \n\n \u201cAnd what about that funny old witch and that little wizard in the navy robes?\u201d \nHermione asked. \n\n \u201cOh yeah, the bloke from Magical Maintenance,\u201d said Ron. \n\n \u201cHow do you know he works for Magical Maintenance?\u201d Hermione asked, her \nsoupspoon suspended in midair. \n\n \u201cDad said everyone from Magical Maintenance wears navy blue robes.\u201d \n\n \u201cBut you never told us that!\u201d \n\n Hermione dropped her spoon and pulled toward her the sheaf of notes and maps \nthat she and Ron had been examining when Harry had entered the kitchen. \n\n \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in here about navy blue robes, nothing!\u201d she said, flipping \nfeverishly through the pages. \n\n \u201cWell, dies it really matter?\u201d \n\n \u201cRon, it all matters! If we\u2019re going to get into the Ministry and not give ourselves \naway when they\u2019re bound to be on the lookout for intruders, every little detail matters! \nWe\u2019ve been over and over this, I mean, what\u2019s the point of all these reconnaissance trips \nif you aren\u2019t even bothering to tell us \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cBlimey, Hermione, I forget one little thing \u2013 \u201c \n\n\f\n \u201cYou do realize, don\u2019t you, that there\u2019s probably no more dangerous place in the \nwhole world for us to be right now than the Ministry of \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cI think we should do it tomorrow,\u201d said Harry. \n\n Hermione stopped dead, her jaw hanging; Ron choked a little over his soup. \n\n \u201cTomorrow?\u201d repeated Hermione. \u201cYou aren\u2019t serious, Harry?\u201d \n\n \u201cI am,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be much better prepared than we \nare now even if we skulk around the Ministry entrance for another month. The longer we \nput it off, the farther away that locket could be. There\u2019s already a good chance Umbridge \nhas chucked it away; the thing doesn\u2019t open.\u201d \n\n \u201cUnless,\u201d said Ron, \u201cshe\u2019s found a way of opening it and she\u2019s now possessed.\u201d \n\n \u201cWouldn\u2019t make any difference to her, she was so evil in the first place,\u201d Harry \nshrugged. \n\n Hermione was biting her lip, deep in thought. \n\n \u201cWe know everything important,\u201d Harry went on, addressing Hermione. \u201cWe \nknow they\u2019ve stopped Apparition in and out of the Ministry; We know only the most \nsenior Ministry members are allowed to connect their homes to the Floo Network now, \nbecause Ron heard those two Unspeakables complaining about it. And we know roughly \nwhere Umbridge\u2019s office is, because of what you heard the bearded bloke saying to his \nmate \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201c\u2019I\u2019ll be up on level one, Dolores wants to see me,\u2019\u201d Hermione recited \nimmediately. \n\n \u201cExactly,\u201d said Harry. \u201cAnd we know you get in using those funny coins, or \ntokens, or whatever they are, because I saw that witch borrowing one from her friend \u2013 \u201c \n\n \u201cBut we haven\u2019t got any!\u201d \n\n \u201cIf the plan works, we will have,\u201d Harry continued calmly. \n\n \u201cI don\u2019t know, Harry, I don\u2019t know \u2026 There are an awful lot of things that could \ngo wrong, so much relies on chance \u2026 \u201c \n\n That\u2019ll be true even if we spend another three months preparing,\u201d said Harry. \u201cIt\u2019s \ntime to act.\u201d \n\n He could tell from Ron\u2019s and Hermione\u2019s faces that they were scared; he was not \nparticularly confident himself, and yet he was sure the time had come to put their plan \ninto operation. \n\n They had spent the previous four weeks taking it in turns to don the Invisibility \nCloak and spy on the official entrance to the Ministry, which Ron, thanks to Mr. Weasley, \nhad known since childhood. They had tailed Ministry workers on their way in, \neavesdropped on their conversations, and learned by careful observation which of them \ncould be relied upon to appear, alone, at the same time every day. Occasionally there had \nbeen a chance to sneak a Daily Prophet out of somebody\u2019s briefcase. Slowly they had \nbuilt up the sketchy maps and notes now stacked in front of Hermione. \n\n \u201cAll right,\u201d said Ron slowly, \u201clet\u2019s say we go for it tomorrow \u2026 I think it should \njust be me and Harry.\u201d \n\n \u201cOh, don\u2019t start that again!\u201d sighed Hermione. \u201cI thought we\u2019d settled this.\u201d \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s one thing hanging around the entrances under the Cloak, but this is different. \nHermione,\u201d Ron jabbed a finger at a copy of the Daily Prophet dated ten days previously. \n\u201cYou\u2019re on the list of Muggle-borns who didn\u2019t present themselves for interrogation!\u201d \n\n\f\n \u201cAnd you\u2019re supposed to be dying of spattergroit at the Burrow! If anyone \nshouldn\u2019t go, it\u2019s Harry, he\u2019s got a ten-thousand-Galleon price on his head \u2013 \u201c \n\n \u201cFine, I\u2019ll stay here,\u201d said Harry. \u201cLet me know if you ever defeat Voldemort, \nwon\u2019t you?\u201d \n\n As Ron and Hermione laughed, pain shot through the scar on Harry\u2019s forehead. \nHis hand jumped to it. He saw Hermione\u2019s eyes narrow, and he tried to pass off the \nmovement by brushing his hair out of his eyes. \n\n \u201cWell, if all three of us go we\u2019ll have to Disapparate separately,\u201d Ron was saying. \n\u201cWe can\u2019t all fit under the Cloak anymore.\u201d \n\n Harry\u2019s scar was becoming more and more painful. He stood up. At once, \nKreacher hurried forward. \n\n \u201cMaster has not finished his soup, would master prefer the savory stew, or else the \ntreacle tart to which Master is so partial?\u201d \n\n \u201cThanks, Kreacher, but I\u2019ll be back in a minute \u2013 er \u2013 bathroom.\u201d \n\n Aware that Hermione was watching him suspiciously, Harry hurried up the stairs \nto the hall and then to the first landing, where he dashed into the bathroom and bolted the \ndoor again. Grunting with pain, he slumped over the black basin with its taps in the form \nof open-mouthed serpents and closed his eyes \u2026. \n\n He was gliding along a twilit street. The buildings on either side of him had high, \ntimbered gables; they looked like gingerbread houses. He approached one of them, then \nsaw the whiteness of his own long-fingered hand against the door. He knocked. He felt a \nmounting excitement \u2026 \n\n The door opened: A laughing woman stood there. Her face fell as she looked into \nHarry\u2019s face: humor gone, terror replacing it \u2026. \n\n \u201cGregorovitch?\u201d said a high, cold voice. \n\n She shook her head: She was trying to close the door. A white hand held it steady, \nprevented her shutting him out \u2026 \n\n \u201cI want Gregorovitch.\u201d \n\n \u201cEr wohnt hier nicht mehr!\u201d she cried, shaking her head. \u201cHe no live here! He no \nlive here! I know him not!\u201d \n\n Abandoning the attempt to close the door, she began to back away down the dark \nhall, and Harry followed, gliding toward her, and his long-fingered hand had drawn his \nwand. \n\n \u201cwhere is he?\u201d \n\n \u201cDas weiff ich nicht! He move! I know not, I know not!\u201d \n\n He raised his hand. She screamed. Two young children came running into the hall. \nShe tried to shield them with her arms. There was a flash of green light \u2013 \n\n \u201cHarry! HARRY!\u201d \n\n He opened his eyes; he had sunk to the floor. Hermione was pounding on the door \nagain. \n\n \u201cHarry, open up!\u201d \n\n He had shouted out, he knew it. He got up and unbolted the door; Hermione \ntoppled inside at once, regained her balance, and looked around suspiciously. Ron was \nright behind her, looking unnerved as he pointed his wand into the corners of the chilly \nbathroom. \n\n \u201cWhat were you doing?\u201d asked Hermione sternly. \n\n\f\n \u201cWhat d\u2019you think I was doing?\u201d asked Harry with feeble bravado. \n\n \u201cYou were yelling your head off!\u201d said Ron. \n\n \u201cOh yeah \u2026 I must\u2019ve dozed off or \u2013 \u201c \n\n \u201cHarry, please don\u2019t insult our intelligence,\u201d said Hermione, taking deep breaths. \n\u201cWe know your scar hurt downstairs, and you\u2019re white as a sheet.\u201d \n\n Harry sat down on the edge of the bath. \n\n \u201cFine. I\u2019ve just seen Voldemort murdering a woman. By now he\u2019s probably killed \nher whole family. And he didn\u2019t need to. It was Cedric all over again, they were just there \n\u2026 \u201c \n\n \u201cHarry, you aren\u2019t supposed to let this happen anymore!\u201d Hermione cried, her \nvoice echoing through the bathroom. \u201cDumbledore wanted you to use Occlumency! HE \nthought the connection was dangerous \u2013 Voldemort can use it, Harry! What good is it to \nwatch him kill and torture, how can it help?\u201d \n\n \u201cBecause it means I know what he\u2019s doing,\u201d said Harry. \n\n \u201cSo you\u2019re not even going to try to shut him out?\u201d \n\n \u201cHermione, I can\u2019t. You know I\u2019m lousy at Occlumency. I never got the hang of \nit.\u201d \n\n \u201cYou never really tried!\u201d she said hotly. \u201cI don\u2019t get it, Harry \u2013 do you like having \nthis special connection or relationship or what \u2013 whatever \u2013 \u201c \n\n She faltered under the look he gave her as he stood up. \n\n \u201cLike it?\u201d he said quietly. \u201cWould you like it?\u201d \n\n \u201cI \u2013 no \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, Harry. I just didn\u2019t mean \u2013 \u201c \n\n \u201cI hate it, I hate the fact that he can get inside me, that I have to watch him when \nhe\u2019s most dangerous. But I\u2019m going to use it.\u201d \n\n \u201cDumbledore \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cForget Dumbledore. This is my choice, nobody else\u2019s. I want to know why he\u2019s \nafter Gregorovitch.\u201d \n\n \u201cWho?\u201d \n\n \u201cHe\u2019s a foreign wandmaker,\u201d said Harry. \u201cHe made Krum\u2019s wand and Krum \nreckons he\u2019s brilliant.\u201d \n\n \u201cBut according to you,\u201d said Ron, \u201cVoldemort\u2019s got Ollivander locked up \nsomewhere. If he\u2019s already got a wandmaker, what does he need another one for?\u201d \n\n \u201cMaybe he agrees with Krum, maybe he thinks Gregorovitch is better \u2026 or else \nhe thinks Gregorovitch will be able to explain what my wand did when he was chasing \nme, because Ollivander didn\u2019t know.\u201d \n\n Harry glanced into the cracked, dusty mirror and saw Ron and Hermione \nexchanging skeptical looks behind his back. \n\n \u201cHarry, you keep talking about what your wand did,\u201d said Hermione, \u201cbut you \nmade it happen! Why are you so determined not to take responsibility for your own \npower?\u201d \n\n \u201cBecause I know it wasn\u2019t me! And so does Voldemort, Hermione! We both \nknow what really happened!\u201d \n\n They glared at each other; Harry knew that he had not convinced Hermione and \nthat she was marshaling counterarguments, against both his theory on his wand and the \nfact that he was permitting himself to see into Voldemort\u2019s mind. To his relief, Ron \nintervened. \n\n\f\n \u201cDrop it,\u201d he advised her. \u201cIt\u2019s up to him. And if we\u2019re going to the Ministry \ntomorrow, don\u2019t you reckon we should go over the plan?\u201d \n\n Reluctantly, as the other two could tell, Hermione let the matter rest, though \nHarry was quite sure she would attack again at the first opportunity. In the meantime, \nthey returned to the basement kitchen, where Kreacher served them all stew and treacle \ntart. \n\n They did not get to bed until late that night, after spending hours going over and \nover their plan until they could recite it, word perfect, to each other. Harry, who was now \nsleeping in Sirius\u2019s room, lay in bed with his wandlight trained on the old photograph of \nhis father, Sirius, Lupin, and Pettigrew, and muttered the plan to himself for another ten \nminutes. As he extinguished his wand, however, he was thinking not of Polyjuice Potion, \nPuking Pastilles, or the navy blue robes of Magical Maintenance; he though of \nGregorovitch the wandmaker, and how long he could hope to remain hidden while \nVoldemort sought him so determinedly. \n\n Dawn seemed to follow midnight with indecent haste. \n\n \u201cYou look terrible,\u201d was Ron\u2019s greeting as he entered the room to wake Harry. \n\n \u201cNot for long,\u201d said Harry, yawning. \n\n They found Hermione downstairs in the kitchen. She was being served coffee and \nhot rolls by Kreacher and wearing the slightly manic expression that Harry associated \nwith exam review. \n\n \u201cRobes,\u201d she said under her breath, acknowledging their presence with a nervous \nnod and continuing to poke around in her beaded bag, \u201cPolyjuice Potion \u2026 Invisibiliity \nCloak \u2026 Decoy Detonators \u2026 You should each take a couple just in case \u2026 Puking \nPastilles, Nosebleed Norgat, Extendable Ears \u2026\u201d \n\n They gulped down their breakfast, then set off upstairs, Kreacher bowing them \nout and promising to have a steak-and-kidney pie ready for them when they returned. \n\n \u201cBless him,\u201d said Ron fondly, \u201cand when you think I used to fantasize about \ncutting off his head and sticking it on the wall.\u201d \n\n They made their way onto the front step with immense caution. They could see a \ncouple of puffy-eyed Death Eaters watching the house from across the misty square. \n\n Hermione Disapparated with Ron first, then came back for Harry. \n\n After the usual brief spell of darkness and near suffocation, Harry found himself \nin the tiny alleyway where the first phase of their plan was scheduled to take place. It was \nas yet deserted, except for a couple of large bins; the first Ministry workers did not \nusually appear here until at least eight o\u2019clock. \n\n \u201cRight then,\u201d said Hermione, checking her watch. \u201cshe ought to be here in about \nfive minutes. When I\u2019ve Stunned her \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cHermione, we know,\u201d said Ron sternly. \u201cAnd I thought we were supposed to \nopen the door before she got here?\u201d \n\n Hermione squealed. \n\n \u201cI nearly forgot! Stand back \u2013\u201c \n\n She pointed her wand at the padlocked and heavily graffitied fire door beside \nthem, which burst open with a crash. The dark corridor behind it led, as they knew from \ntheir careful scouting trips, into an empty theater. Hermione pulled the door back toward \nher, to make it look as thought it was still closed. \n\n\f\n \u201cAnd now,\u201d she said, turning, back to face the other two in the alleyway, \u201cwe put \non the Cloak again \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201c\u2014and we wait,\u201d Ron finished, throwing it over Hermione\u2019s head like a blanket \nover a birdcage and rolling his eyes at Harry. \n\n Little more than a minute later, there was a tiny pop and a little Ministry witch \nwith flyaway gray hair Apparated feet from them, blinking a little in the sudden \nbrightness: the sun had just come out from behind a cloud. She barely had time to enjoy \nthe unexpected warmth, however, before Hermione\u2019s silent Stunning Spell hit her in the \nchest and she toppled over. \n\n \u201cNicely done, Hermione,\u201d said Ron, emerging behind a bin beside the theater \ndoor as Harry took off the Invisibility Cloak. Together they carried the little witch into \nthe dark passageway that led backstage. Hermione plucked a few hairs from the witch\u2019s \nhead and added them to a flask of muddy Polyjuice Potion she had taken from the beaded \nbag. Ron was rummaging through the little witch\u2019s handbag. \n\n \u201cShe\u2019s Mafalda Hopkirk,\u201d he said, reading a small card that identified their victim \nas an assistant in the Improper Use of Magic Office. \u201cYou\u2019d better take this, Hermione, \nand here are the tokens.\u201d \n\n He passed her several small golden coins, all embossed with the letters M.O.M., \nwhich he had taken from the witch\u2019s purse. \n\n Hermione drank the Polyjuice Potion, which was now a pleasant heliotrope color, \nand within seconds stood before them, the double of Mafalda Hopkirk. As she removed \nMafalda\u2019s spectacles and put them on, Harry checked his watch. \n\n \u201cWe\u2019re running late, Mr. Magical Maintenance will be here any second.\u201d \n\n They hurried to close the door on the real Mafalda; Harry and Ron threw the \nInvisibility Cloak over themselves but Hermione remained in view, waiting. Seconds \nlater there was another pop, and a small, ferrety looking wizard appeared before them. \n\n \u201cOh, hello, Mafalda.\u201d \n\n \u201cHello!\u201d said Hermione in a quavery voice, \u201cHow are you today?\u201d \n\n \u201cNot so good, actually,\u201d replied the little wizard, who looked thoroughly \ndowncast. \n\n As Hermione and the wizard headed for the main road, Harry and Ron crept along \nbehind them. \n\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear you\u2019re under the weather,\u201d said Hermione, talking firmly over \nthe little wizard and he tried to expound upon his problems; it was essential to stop him \nfrom reaching the street. \u201cHere, have a sweet.\u201d \n\n \u201cEh? Oh, no thanks \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cI insist!\u201d said Hermione aggressively, shaking the bag of pastilles in his face. \nLooking rather alarmed, the little wizard took one. \n\n The effect was instantaneous. The moment the pastille touched his tongue, the \nlittle wizard started vomiting so hard that he did not even notice as Hermione yanked a \nhandful of hairs from the top of his head. \n\n \u201cOh dear!\u201d she said, as he splattered the alley with sick. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019d better \ntake the day off!\u201d \n\n \u201cNo \u2013 no!\u201d He choked and retched, trying to continue on his way despite being \nunable to walk straight. \u201cI must \u2013 today \u2013 must go \u2013 \u201c \n\n\f\n \u201cBut that\u2019s just silly!\u201d said Hermione, alarmed. \u201cYou can\u2019t go to work in this state \n\u2013 I think you ought to go to St. Mungo\u2019s and get them to sort you out.\u201d \n\n The wizard had collapsed, heaving, onto all fours, still trying to crawl toward the \nmain street. \n\n \u201cYou simply can\u2019t go to work like this!\u201d cried Hermione. \n\n At last he seemed to accept the truth of her words. Using a reposed Hermione to \nclaw his way back into a standing position, he turned on the spot and vanished, leaving \nnothing behind but the bag Ron had snatched from his hand as he went and some flying \nchunks of vomit. \n\n \u201cUrgh,\u201d said Hermione, holding up the skirt of her robe to avoid the puddles of \nsick. \u201cIt would have made much less mess to Stun him too.\u201d \n\n \u201cYeah,\u201d said Ron, emerging from under the cloak holding the wizard\u2019s bag, \u201cbut I \nstill think a whole pile of unconscious bodies would have drawn more attention. Keen on \nhis job, though, isn\u2019t he? Chuck us the hair and the potion, then.\u201d \n\n Within two minutes, Ron stood before them, as small and ferrety as the sick \nwizard, and wearing the navy blue robes that had been folded in his bag. \n\n \u201cWeird he wasn\u2019t wearing them today, wasn\u2019t it, seeing how much he wanted to \ngo? Anyway, I\u2019m Reg Cattermole, according to the label in the back.\u201d \n\n \u201cNow wait here,\u201d Hermione told Harry, who was still under the Invisibility Cloak, \n\u201cand we\u2019ll be back with some hairs for you.\u201d \n\n He had to wait ten minutes, but it seemed much longer to Harry, skulking alone in \nthe sick-splattered alleyway beside the door concealing the Stunned Mafalda. Finally Ron \nand Hermione reappeared. \n\n \u201cWe don\u2019t know who he is,\u201d Hermione said, passing Harry several curly black \nhairs, \u201cbut he\u2019s gone home with a dreadful nosebleed! Here, he\u2019s pretty tall, you\u2019ll need \nbigger robes \u2026\u201d \n\n She pulled out a set of the old robes Kreacher had laundered for them, and Harry \nretired to take the potion and change. \n\n Once the painful transformation was complete he was more than six feet tall and, \nfrom what he could tell from his well-muscled arms, powerfully built. He also had a \nbeard. Stowing the Invisibility Cloak and his glasses inside his new robes, he rejoined the \nother two. \n\n \u201cBlimey, that\u2019s scary,\u201d said Ron, looking up at Harry, who now towered over him. \n\n \u201cTake one of Mafalda\u2019s tokens,\u201d Hermione told Harry, \u201cand let\u2019s go, it\u2019s nearly \nnine.\u201d \n\n They stepped out of the alleyway together. Fifty yards along the crowded \npavement there were spiked black railings flanking two flights of stairs, one labeled \nGENTLEMEN, the other LADIES. \n\n \u201cSee you in a moment, then,\u201d said Hermione nervously, and she tottered off down \nthe steps to LADIES. Harry and Ron joined a number of oddly dressed men descending \ninto what appeared to be an ordinary underground public toilet, tiled in grimy black and \nwhite. \n\n \u201cMorning, Reg!\u201d called another wizard in navy blue robes as he let himself into a \ncubicle by inserting his golden token into a slot in the door. \u201cBlooming pain in the bum, \nthis, eh? Forcing us all to get to work this way! Who are they expecting to turn up, Harry \nPotter?\u201d \n\n\f\n The wizard roared with laughter at his own wit. Ron gave a forced chuckle. \n\n \u201cYeah,\u201d he said, \u201cstupid, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \n\n And he and Harry let themselves into adjoining cubicles. \n\n To Harry\u2019s left and right came the sound of flushing. He crouched down and \npeered through the gap at the bottom of the cubicle, just in time to see a pair of booted \nfeet climbing into the toilet next door. He looked left and saw Ron blinking at him. \n\n \u201cWe have to flush ourselves in?\u201d he whispered. \n\n \u201cLooks like it,\u201d Harry whispered back; his voice came out deep and gravelly. \n\n They both stood up. Feeling exceptionally foolish, Harry clambered into the toilet. \n\n He knew at once that he had done the right thing; thought he appeared to be \nstanding in water, his shoes, feet, and robes remained quite dry. He reached up, pulled the \nchain, and next moment had zoomed down a short chute, emerging out of a fireplace into \nthe Ministry of Magic. \n\n He got up clumsily; there was a lot more of his body than he was accustomed to. \nThe great Atrium seemed darker than Harry remembered it. Previously a golden fountain \nhad filled the center of the hall, casting shimmering spots of light over the polished \nwooden floor and walls. Now a gigantic statue of black stone dominated the scene. It was \nrather frightening, this vast sculpture of a witch and a wizard sitting on ornately carved \nthrones, looking down at the Ministry workers toppling out of fireplaces below them. \nEngraved in foot-high letters at the base of the statue were the words MAGIC IS MIGHT. \n\n Harry received a heavy blow on the back of the legs. Another wizard had just \nflown out of the fireplace behind him. \n\n \u201cOut of the way, can\u2019t y \u2013 oh, sorry, Runcorn.\u201d \n\n Clearly frightened, the balding wizard hurried away. Apparently the man who \nHarry was impersonating, Runcorn, was intimidating. \n\n \u201cPsst!\u201d said a voice, and he looked around to see a whispy little witch and the \nferrety wizard from Magical Maintenance gesturing to him from over beside the statue. \nHarry hastened to join them. \n\n \u201cYou got in all right, then?\u201d Hermione whispered to Harry. \n\n \u201cNo, he\u2019s still stuck in the hog,\u201d said Ron. \n\n \u201cOh, very funny \u2026 It\u2019s horrible, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she said to Harry, who was staring up \nat the statue. \u201cHave you seen what they\u2019re sitting on?\u201d \n\n Harry looked more closely and realized that what he had thought were \ndecoratively carved thrones were actually mounds of carved humans: hundreds and \nhundreds of naked bodies, men, women, and children, all with rather stupid, ugly faces, \ntwisted and pressed together to support the weight of the handsomely robed wizards. \n\n \u201cMuggles,\u201d whispered Hermione, \u201cIn their rightful place. Come on, let\u2019s get \ngoing.\u201d \n\n They joined the stream of witches and wizards moving toward the golden gates at \nthe end of the hall, looking around as surreptitiously as possible, but there was no sign of \nthe distinctive figure of Dolores Umbridge. They passed through the gates and into a \nsmaller hall, where queues were forming in front of twenty golden grilles housing as \nmany lifts. They had barely joined the nearest one when a voice said, \u201cCattermole!\u201d \n\n They looked around: Harry\u2019s stomach turned over. One of the Death Eaters who \nhad witnessed Dumbledore\u2019s death was striding toward them. The Ministry workers \nbeside them fell silent, their eyes downcast; Harry could feel fear rippling through them. \n\n\f\nThe man\u2019s scowling, slightly brutish face was somehow at odds with his magnificent, \nsweeping robes, which were embroidered with much gold thread. Someone in the crowd \naround the lifts called sycophantically, \u201cMorning, Yaxley!\u201d Yaxley ignored them. \n\n \u201cI requested somebody from Magical Maintenance to sort out my office, \nCattermole. It\u2019s still raining in there.\u201d \n\n Ron looked around as though hoping somebody else would intervene, but nobody \nspoke. \n\n \u201cRaining \u2026 in your office? That\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s not good, is it?\u201d \n\n Ron gave a nervous laugh. Yaxley\u2019s eyes widened. \n\n \u201cYou think it\u2019s funny, Cattermole, do you?\u201d \n\n A pair of witches broke away from the queue for the lift and bustled off. \n\n \u201cNo,\u201d said Ron, \u201cno, of course \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cYou realize that I am on my way downstairs to interrogate your wife, \nCattermole? In fact, I\u2019m quite surprised you\u2019re not down there holding her hand while \nshe waits. Already given her up as a bad job, have you? Probably wise. Be sure and \nmarry a pureblood next time.\u201d \n\n Hermione had let out a little squeak of horror. Yaxley looked at her. She cough \nfeebly and turned away. \n\n \u201cI \u2013 I \u2013\u201c stammered Ron. \n\n \u201cBut if my wife were accused of being a Mudblood,\u201d said Yaxley, \u201c\u2014not that any \nwoman I married would ever be mistaken for such filth \u2013 and the Head of Department of \nMagical Law Enforcement needed a job doing, I would make it my priority to do this job, \nCattermole. Do you understand me?\u201d \n\n \u201cYes,\u201d whispered Ron. \n\n \u201cThen attend to it, Cattermole, and if my office is not completely dry within an \nhour, your wife\u2019s Blood Status will be in even greater doubt than it is now.\u201d \n\n The golden grille before them clattered open. With a nod and unpleasant smile to \nHarry, who was evidently expected to appreciate this treatment of Cattermole, Yaxley \nswept away toward another lift. Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered theirs, but nobody \nfollowed them: It was as if they were infectious. The grilles shut with a clang and the lift \nbegan to move upward. \n\n \u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d Ron asked the other two at once; he looked stricken. \u201cIf \nI don\u2019t turn up, my wife \u2026 I mean, Cattermole\u2019s wife \u2013 \u201c \n\n \u201cWe\u2019ll come with you, we should stick together \u2013\u201c began Harry, but Ron shook \nhis head feverishly. \n\n \u201cThat\u2019s mental, we haven\u2019t got much time. You two find Umbridge, I\u2019ll go and \nsort out Yaxley\u2019s office \u2013 but how do I stop a raining?\u201d \n\n \u201cTry Finite Incantatem,\u201d said Hermione at once, \u201cthat should stop the rain if it\u2019s a \nhex or curse; if it doesn\u2019t something\u2019s gone wrong with an Atmospheric Charm, which \nwill be more difficult to fix, so as an interim measure try Impervius to protect his \nbelongings \u2013 \u201c \n\n \u201cSay it again, slowly \u2013 \u201c said Ron, searching his pockets desperately for a quill, \nbut at that moment the lift juddered to a halt. A disembodied female voice said, \u201cLevel \nfour, Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, incorporating \nBeast, Being, and Spirit Divisions, Goblin Liaison Office, and Pest Advisory Bureau,\u201d \n\n\f\nand the grilles slid open again, admitting a couple of wizards and several pale violet \npaper airplanes that fluttered around the lamp in the ceiling of the lift. \n\n \u201cMorning, Albert,\u201d said a bushily whiskered man, smiling at Harry. He glanced \nover at Ron and Hermione as the lift creaked upward once more; Hermione was now \nwhispering frantic instructions to Ron. The wizard leaned toward Harry, leering, and \nmuttering \u201cDirk Cresswell, eh? From Goblin Liaison? Nice one, Albert. I\u2019m pretty \nconfident I\u2019ll get his job now!\u201d \n\n He winked. Harry smiled back, hoping that this would suffice. The lift stopped; \nthe grilles opened once more. \n\n \u201cLevel two, Department of Magical Law Enforcement, including the Improper \nUse of Magic Office, Auror Headquarters, and Wizengamot Administration Services,\u201d \nsaid the disembodied witch\u2019s voice. \n\n Harry saw Hermione give Ron a little push and he hurried out of the lift, followed \nby the other wizards, leaving Harry and Hermione alone. The moment the golden door \nhad closed Hermione said, very fast, \u201cActually, Harry, I think I\u2019d better go after him, I \ndon\u2019t think he knows what he\u2019s doing and if he gets caught the whole thing \u2013 \u201c \n\n \u201cLevel one, Minister of Magic and Support Staff.\u201d \n\n The golden grilles slid apart again and Hermione gasped. Four people stood \nbefore them, two of them deep in conversation: a long-haired wizard wearing magnificent \nrobes of black and gold, and a squat, toadlike witch wearing a velvet bow in her short \nhair and clutching a clipboard to her chest. \n\n \n\nChapter Thirteen \n\nThe Muggle-Born Registration Commission \n\n \n\n \u201cAh, Mafalda!\u201d said Umbridge, looking at Hermione. \u201cTravers sent you, did he?\u201d \n\n \u201cY-yes,\u201d squeaked Hermione. \n\n \u201cGod, you\u2019ll do perfectly well.\u201d Umbridge spoke to the wizard in black and gold. \n\u201cThat\u2019s that problem solved. Minister, if Mafalda can be spared for record-keeping we \nshall be able to start straightaway.\u201d She consulted her clipboard. \u201cTen people today and \none of them the wife of a Ministry employee! Tut, tut\u2026 even here, in the heart of the \nMinistry!\u201d She stepped into the lift besides Hermione, as did the two wizards who had \nbeen listening to Umbridge\u2019s conversation with the Minister. \u201cWe\u2019ll go straight down, \nMafalda, you\u2019ll find everything you need in the courtroom. Good morning, Albert, aren\u2019t \nyou getting out?\u201d \n\n \u201cYes, of course,\u201d said Harry in Runcorn\u2019s deep voice. \n\n Harry stepped out of the life. The golden grilles clanged shut behind him. \nGlancing over his shoulder, Harry saw Hermione\u2019s anxious face sinking back out of sight, \na tall wizard on either side of her, Umbridge\u2019s velvet hair-bow level with her shoulder. \n\n \u201cWhat brings you here, Runcorn?\u201d asked the new Minister of Magic. His long \nblack hair and beard were streaked with silver and a great overhanging forehead \nshadowed his glinting eyes, putting Harry in the mind of a crab looking out from beneath \na rock. \n\n\f\n \u201cNeeded a quick word with,\u201d Harry hesitated for a fraction of a second, \u201cArthur \nWeasley. Someone said he was up on level one.\u201d \n\n \u201cAh,\u201d said Plum Thicknesse. \u201cHas he been caught having contact with an \nUndesirable?\u201d \n\n \u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, his throat dry. \u201cNo, nothing like that.\u201d \n\n \u201cAh, well. It\u2019s only a matter of time,\u201d said Thicknesse. \u201cIf you ask me, the blood \ntraitors are as bad as the Mudbloods. Good day, Runcorn.\u201d \n\n \u201cGood day, Minister.\u201d \n\n Harry watched Thicknesse march away along the thickly carpeted corridor. The \nmoment the Minister had passed out of sight, Harry tugged the Invisibility Cloak out \nfrom under his heavy black cloak, threw it over himself, and set off along the corridor in \nthe opposite direction. Runcorn was so tall that Harry was forced to stoop to make sure \nhis big feet were hidden. \n\n Panic pulsed in the pit of his stomach. As he passed gleaming wooden door after \ngleaming wooden door, each bearing a small plaque with the owner\u2019s name and \noccupation upon it, the might of the Ministry, its complexity, its impenetrability, seemed \nto force itself upon him so that the plan he had been carefully concocting with Ron and \nHermione over the past four weeks seemed laughably childish. They had concentrated all \ntheir efforts on getting inside without being detected: They had not given a moment\u2019s \nthought to what they would do if they were forced to separate. Now Hermione was stuck \nin court proceedings, which would undoubtedly last hours; Ron was struggling to do \nmagic that Harry was sure was beyond him, a woman\u2019s liberty possibly depending on the \noutcome, and he, Harry, was wandering around on the top floor when he knew perfectly \nwell that his quarry had just gone down in the lift. \n\n He stopped walking, leaned against a wall, and tried to decide what to do. The \nsilence pressed upon him: There was no bustling or talk or swift footsteps here the \npurple-carpeted corridors were as hushed as though the Muffliato charm had been cast \nover the place. \n\n Her office must be up here, Harry thought. \n\n It seemed most unlikely that Umbridge would keep her jewelry in her office, but \non the other hand it seemed foolish not to search it to make sure. He therefore set off \nalong the corridor again, passing nobody but a frowning wizard who was murmuring \ninstructions to a quill that floated in front of him, scribbling on a trail of parchment. \n\n Now paying attention to the names on the doors, Harry turned a corner. Halfway \nalong the next corridor he emerged into a wide, open space where a dozen witches and \nwizards sat in rows at small desks not unlike school desks, though much more highly \npolished and free from graffiti. Harry paused to watch them, for the effect was quite \nmesmerizing. They were all waving and twiddling their wands in unison, and squares of \ncolored paper were flying in every direction like little pink kites. After a few seconds, \nHarry realized that there was a rhythm to the proceedings, that the papers all formed the \nsame pattern and after a few more seconds he realized what he was watching was the \ncreation of pamphlets \u2013 that the paper squares were pages, which, when assembled, \nfolded and magicked into place, fell into neat stacks beside each witch or wizard. \n\n Harry crept closer, although the workers were so intent on what they were doing \nthat he doubted they would notice a carpet-muffled footstep, and he slid a completed \n\n\f\npamphlet from the pile beside a young witch. He examined it beneath the Invisibility \nCloak. Its pink cover was emblazoned with a golden title: \n\n \n\nMudbloods \n\nand the Dangers They Pose to \n\na Peaceful Pure-Blood Society \n\n \n\n Beneath the title was a picture of a red rose with a simpering face in the middle of \nits petals, being strangled by a green weed with fangs and a scowl. There was no author\u2019s \nname upon the pamphlet, but again, the scars on the back of his right hand seemed to \ntingle as he examined it. Then the young witch beside him confirmed his suspicion as she \nsaid, still waving and twirling her wand, \u201cWill the old hag be interrogating Mudbloods all \nday, does anyone know?\u201d \n\n \u201cCareful,\u201d said the wizard beside her, glancing around nervously; one of his pages \nslipped and fell to the floor. \n\n \u201cWhat, has she got magic ears as well as an eye, now?\u201d \n\n The witch glanced toward the shining mahogany door facing the space full of \npamphlet-makers; Harry looked too, and the rage reared in him like a snake. Where there \nmight have been a peephole on a Muggle front door, a large, round eye with a bright blue \niris had been set into the wood \u2013 an eye that was shockingly familiar to anybody who had \nknown Alastor Moody. \n\n For a split second Harry forgot where he was and what he was doing there: He \neven forgot that he was invisible. He strode straight over to the door to examine the eye. \nIt was not moving. It gazed blindly upward, frozen. The plaque beneath it read: \n\n \n\nDolores Umbridge \n\nSenior Undersecretary to the Minister \n\n \n\n Below that a slightly shinier new plaque read: \n\n \n\nHead of the Muggle-Born \n\nRegistration Commission \n\n \n\n Harry looked back at the dozen pamphlet-makers: Though they were intent upon \ntheir work, he could hardly suppose that they would not notice if the door of an empty \noffice opened in front of them. He therefore withdrew from an inner pocket an odd object \nwith little waving legs and a rubber-bulbed horn for a body. Crouching down beneath the \nCloak, he placed the Decoy Detonator on the ground. \n\n It scuttled away at once through the legs of the witches and wizards in front of \nhim. A few moments later, during which Harry waited with his hand upon the doorknob, \nthere came a loud bang and a great deal of acrid smoke billowed from a corner. The \nyoung witch in the front row shrieked: Pink pages flew everywhere as she and her \nfellows jumped up, looking around for the source of the commotion. Harry turned the \ndoorknob, stepped into Umbridge\u2019s office, and closed the door behind him. \n\n\f\n He felt he had stepped back in time. The room was exactly like Umbridge\u2019s office \nat Hogwarts: Lace draperies, doilies and dried flowers covered every surface. The walls \nbore the same ornamental plates, each featuring a highly colored, beribboned kitten, \ngamboling and frisking with sickening cuteness. The desk was covered with a flouncy, \nflowered cloth. Behind Mad-eye\u2019s eye, a telescopic attachment enabled Umbridge to spy \non the workers on the other side of the door. Harry took a look through it and saw that \nthey were all still gathered around the Decoy Detonator. He wrenched the telescope out \nof the door, leaving a hole behind, pulled the magical eyeball out of it, and placed it in his \npocket. The he turned to face the room again, raised his wand, and murmured, \u201cAccio \nLocker.\u201d \n\n Nothing happened, but he had not expected it to; no doubt Umbridge knew all \nabout protective charms and spells. He therefore hurried behind her desk and began \npulling open all the drawers. He saw quills and notebooks and Spellotape; enchanted \npaper clips that coiled snakelike from their drawer and had be beaten back; a fussy little \nlace box full of spare hair bows and clips; but no sign of a locket. \n\n There was a filing cabinet behind the desk: Harry set to searching it. Like Filch\u2019s \nfiling cabinet at Hogwarts, it was full of folders, each labeled with a name. It was not \nuntil Harry reached the bottommost drawer that he saw something to distract him from \nthe search: Mr. Weasley\u2019s file. \n\n He pulled it out and opened it. \n\n \n\nArthur Weasley \n\nBlood Status: \n\nPureblood, but with unacceptable pro-Muggle \nleanings. Known member of the Order of the \nPhoenix. \n\nFamily: \n\nWife (pureblood), seven children, two \nyoungest at Hogwarts. NB: Youngest son \ncurrently at home, seriously ill, Ministry \ninspectors have confirmed. \n\nSecurity Status: \n\nTRACKED. All movements are being \nmonitored. Strong likelihood Undesirable No. \n1 will contact (has stayed with Weasley \nfamily previously) \n\n\n\n \n\n \u201cUndesirable Number One,\u201d Harry muttered under his breath as he replaced Mr. \nWeasley\u2019s folder and shut the drawer. He had an idea he knew who that was, and sure \nenough, as he straightened up and glanced around the office for fresh hiding places he \nsaw a poster of himself on the wall, with the words UNDESIRABLE NO. 1 emblazoned \nacross his chest. A little pink note was stuck to it with a picture of a kitten in the corner. \nHarry moved across to read it and saw that Umbridge had written, \u201cTo be punished.\u201d \n\n Angrier than ever, he proceeded to grope in the bottoms of the vases and baskets \nof dried flowers, but was not at all surprised that the locket was not there. He gave the \noffice one last sweeping look, and his heart skipped a beat. Dumbledore was staring at \nhim from a small rectangular mirror, propped up on a bookcase beside the desk. \n\n Harry crossed the room at a run and snatched it up, but realized that the moment \nhe touched it that it was not a mirror at all. Dumbledore was smiling wistfully out of the \n\n\f\nfront cover of a glossy book. Harry had not immediately noticed the curly green writing \nacross his hat \u2013 The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore \u2013 nor the slightly smaller writing \nacross his chest: \u201cby Rita Skeeter, bestselling author of Armando Dippet: Master or \nMoron?\u201d \n\n Harry opened the book at random and saw a full-page photograph of two teenage \nboys, both laughing immoderately with their arms around each other\u2019s shoulders. \nDumbledore, now with elbow-length hair, had grown a tiny wispy beard that recalled the \none on Krum\u2019s chin that had so annoyed Ron. The boy who roared in silent amusement \nbeside Dumbledore had a gleeful, wild look about him. His golden hair fell in curls to his \nshoulders. Harry wondered whether it was a young Doge, but before he could check the \ncaption, the door of the office opened. \n\n If Thicknesse had not been looking over his shoulder as he entered, Harry would \nnot have had time to pull the Invisibility Cloak over himself. As it was, he thought \nThicknesse might have caught a glimpse of movement, because for a moment or two he \nremained quite still, staring curiously at the place where Harry had just vanished. Perhaps \ndeciding that that all he had seen was Dumbledore scratching his nose on the front of the \nbook, for Harry had hastily replaced it upon the shelf. Thicknesse finally walked to the \ndesk and pointed his wand at the quill standing ready in the ink pot. It sprang out and \nbegan scribbling a note to Umbridge. Very slowly, hardly daring to breathe, Harry \nbacked out of the office into the open area beyond. \n\n The pamphlet-makers were still clustered around the remains of the Decoy \nDetonator, which continued to hoot feebly as it smoked. Harry hurried off up the corridor \nas the young witch said, \u201cI bet it sneaked up here from Experimental Charms, they\u2019re so \ncareless, remember that poisonous duck?\u201d \n\n Speeding back toward the lifts, Harry reviewed his options. It had never been \nlikely that the locket was here at the Ministry, and there was no hope of bewitching its \nwhereabouts out of Umbridge while she was sitting in a crowded court. Their priority \nnow had to be to leave the Ministry before they were exposed, and try again another day. \nThe first thing to do was to find Ron, and then they could work out a way of extracting \nHermione from the courtroom. \n\n The lift was empty when it arrived. Harry jumped in and pulled off the Invisibility \nCloak as it started its descent. To his enormous relief, when it rattled to a halt at level two, \na soaking-wet and wild-eyed Ron got in. \n\n \u201cM-morning,\u201d he stammered to Harry as the lift set off again. \n\n \u201cRon, it\u2019s me, Harry!\u201d \n\n \u201cHarry! Blimey, I forgot what you looked like \u2013 why isn\u2019t Hermione with you?\u201d \n\n \u201cShe had to go down to the courtrooms with Umbridge, she couldn\u2019t refuse, and \u2013\n\u201c \n\n But before Harry could finish the lift had stopped again. The doors opened and \nMr. Weasley walked inside, talking to an elderly witch whose blonde hair was teased so \nhigh it resembled an anthill. \n\n \u201c\u2026 I quite understand what you\u2019re saying, Wakanda, but I\u2019m afraid I cannot be \nparty to \u2013 \u201c \n\n Mr. Weasley broke off; he had noticed Harry. It was very strange to have Mr. \nWeasley glare at him with that much dislike. The lift doors closed and the four of them \ntrundled downward once more. \n\n\f\n \u201cOh hello, Reg,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, looking around at the sound of steady \ndripping from Ron\u2019s robes. \u201cIsn\u2019t your wife in for questioning today? Er \u2013 what\u2019s \nhappened to you? Why are you so wet?\u201d \n\n \u201cYaxley\u2019s office is raining,\u201d said Ron. He addressed Mr. Weasley\u2019s shoulder, and \nHarry felt sure he was scared that his father might recognize him if they looked directly \ninto each other\u2019s eyes. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stop it, so they\u2019ve sent me to get Bernie \u2013 Pillsworth, I \nthink they said \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cYes, a lot of offices have been raining lately,\u201d said Mr. Weasley. \u201cDid you try \nMeterolojinx Recanto? It worked for Bletchley.\u201d \n\n \u201cMeteolojinx Recanto?\u201d whispered Ron. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. Thanks, D \u2013 I mean, \nthanks, Arthur.\u201d \n\n The lift doors opened; the old witch with the anthill hair left, and Ron darted past \nher out of sight. Harry made to follow him, but found his path blocked as Percy Weasley \nstrode into the lift, his nose buried in some papers he was reading. \n\n Not until the doors had clanged shut again did Percy realize he was in a lit with \nhis father. He glanced up, saw Mr. Weasley, turned radish red, and left the lift the \nmoment the doors opened again. For the second time, Harry tried to get out, but this time \nfound his way blocked by Mr. Weasley\u2019s arm. \n\n \u201cOne moment, Runcorn.\u201d \n\n The lift doors closed and as they clanked down another floor, Mr. Weasley said, \n\u201cI hear you had information about Dirk Cresswell.\u201d \n\n Harry had the impression that Mr. Weasley\u2019s anger was no less because of the \nbrush with Percy. He decided his best chance was to act stupid. \n\n \u201cSorry?\u201d he said. \n\n \u201cDon\u2019t pretend, Runcorn,\u201d said Mr. Weasley fiercely. \u201cYou tracked down the \nwizard who faked his family tree, didn\u2019t you?\u201d \n\n \u201cI \u2013 so what if I did?\u201d said Harry. \n\n \u201cSo Dirk Cresswell is ten times the wizard you are,\u201d said Mr. Weasley quietly, as \nthe lift sank ever lower. \u201cAnd if he survives Azkaban, you\u2019ll have to answer to him, not \nto mention his wife, his sons, and his friends \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cArthur,\u201d Harry interrupted, \u201cyou know you\u2019re being tracked, don\u2019t you?\u201d \n\n \u201cIs that a threat, Runcorn?\u201d said Mr. Weasley loudly. \n\n \u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, \u201cit\u2019s a fact! They\u2019re watching your every move \u2013\u201c \n\n The lift doors opened. They had reached the Atrium. Mr. Weasley gave Harry a \nscathing look and swept from the lift. Harry stood there, shaken. He wished he was \nimpersonating somebody other than Runcorn\u2026. The lift doors clanged shut. \n\n Harry pulled out the Invisibility Cloak and put it back on. He would try to \nextricate Hermione on his own while Ron was dealing with the raining office. When the \ndoors opened, he stepped out into a torch-lit stone passageway quite different from the \nwood-paneled and carpeted corridors above. As the left rattled away again, Harry \nshivered slightly, looking toward the distant black door that marked the entrance to the \nDepartment of Mysteries. \n\n He set off, his destination not the black door, but the doorway he remembered on \nthe left hand side, which opened onto the flight of stairs down to the court chambers. His \nmind grappled with possibilities as he crept down them: He still had a couple of Decoy \nDetonators, but perhaps it would be better to simply knock on the courtroom door, enter \n\n\f\nas Runcorn, and ask for a quick word with Mafalda? Of course, he did not know whether \nRuncorn was sufficiently important to get away with this, and even if he managed it, \nHermione\u2019s non-reappearance might trigger a search before they were clear of the \nMinistry\u2026. \n\n Lost in thought, he did not immediately register the unnatural chill that was \ncreeping over him, as if he were descending into fog. It was becoming colder and colder \nwith every step he took; a cold that reached right down his throat and tore at his lungs. \nAnd then he felt that stealing sense of despair, or hopelessness, filling him, expanding \ninside him\u2026. \n\n Dementors, he thought. \n\n And as he reached the foot of the stairs and turned to his right he saw a dreadful \nscene. The dark passage outside the courtrooms was packed with tall, black-hooded \nfigures, their faces completely hidden, their ragged breathing the only sound in the place. \nThe petrified Muggle-borns brought in for questioning sat huddled and shivering on hard \nwooden benches. Most of them were hiding their faces in their hands, perhaps in an \ninstinctive attempt to shield themselves from the dementors\u2019 greedy mouths. Some were \naccompanied by families, others sat alone. The dementors were gliding up and down in \nfront of them, and the cold, and the hopelessness, and the despair of the place laid \nthemselves upon Harry like a curse\u2026. \n\n Fight it, he told himself, but he knew that he could not conjure a Patronus here \nwithout revealing himself instantly. So he moved forward as silently as he could, and \nwith every step he took numbness seemed to steal over his brain, but he forced himself to \nthink of Hermione and of Ron, who needed him. \n\n Moving through the towering black figures was terrifying: The eyeless faces \nhidden beneath their hoods turned as he passed, and he felt sure that they sensed him, \nsensed, perhaps, a human presence that still had some hope, some resilience\u2026. \n\n And then, abruptly and shockingly amid the frozen silence, one of the dungeon \ndoors on the left of the corridor was flung open and screams echoed out of it. \n\n \u201cNo, no, I\u2019m half-blood, I\u2019m half-blood, I tell you! My father was a wizard, he \nwas, look him up, Arkie Alderton, he\u2019s a well known broomstick designer, look him up, I \ntell you \u2013 get your hands off me, get your hands off \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cThis is your final warning,\u201d said Umbridge\u2019s soft voice, magically magnified so \nthat it sounded clearly over the man\u2019s desperate screams. \u201cIf you struggle, you will be \nsubjected to the Dementor\u2019s Kiss.\u201d \n\n The man\u2019s screams subsided, but dry sobs echoed through the corridor. \n\n \u201cTake him away,\u201d said Umbridge. \n\n Two dementors appeared in the doorway of the courtroom, their rotting, scabbed \nhands clutching the upper arms of a wizard who appeared to be fainting. They glided \naway down the corridor with him, and the darkness they trailed behind them swallowed \nhim from sight. \n\n \u201cNext \u2013 Mary Cattermole,\u201d called Umbridge. \n\n A small woman stood up; she was trembling from head to foot. Her dark hair was \nsmoothed back into a bun and she wore long plain robes. Her face was completely \nbloodless. As she passed the dementors, Harry saw her shudder. \n\n\f\n \u201cSpare us,\u201d spat Yaxley. \u201cThe brats of Mudbloods do not stir our sympathies.\u201d \n\n Mrs. Cattermole\u2019s sobs masked Harry\u2019s footsteps as he made his way carefully \ntoward the steps that led up to the raised platform. The moment he had passed the place \nwhere the Patronus cat patrolled, he felt the change in temperature: It was warm and \ncomfortable here. The Patronus, he was sure, was Umbridge\u2019s, and it glowed brightly \nbecause she was so happy here, in her element, upholding the twisted laws she had \nhelped to write. Slowly and very carefully he edged his way along the platform behind \nUmbridge, Yaxley, and Hermione, taking a seat behind the latter. He was worried about \nmaking Hermione jump. He thought of casting the Muffliato charm upon Umbridge and \nYaxley, but even murmuring the word might cause Hermione alarm. Then Umbridge \nraised her voice to address Mrs. Cattermole, and Harry seized his chance. \n\n \u201cI\u2019m behind you,\u201d he whispered into Hermione\u2019s ear. \n\n As he had expected, she jumped so violently she nearly overturned the bottle of \nink with which she was supposed to be recording the interview, but both Umbridge and \nYaxley were concentrating upon Mrs. Cattermole, and this went unnoticed. \n\n \u201cA wand was taken from you upon your arrival at the Ministry today, Mrs. \nCattermole,\u201d Umbridge was saying. \u201cEight-and-three-quarter inches, cherry, unicorn-hair \ncore. Do you recognize the description?\u201d \n\n Mrs. Cattermole nodded, mopping her eyes on her sleeve. \n\n \u201cCould you please tell us from which witch or wizard you took that wand?\u201d \n\n He did it instinctively, without any sort of plan, because he hated the sight of her \nwalking alone into the dungeon: As the door began to swing closed, he slipped into the \ncourtroom behind her. \n\n It was not the same room in which he had once been interrogated for improper use \nof magic. This one was much smaller, though the ceiling was quite as high it gave the \nclaustrophobic sense of being stuck at the bottom of a deep well. \n\n There were more dementors in here, casting their freezing aura over the place; \nthey stood like faceless sentinels in the corners farthest from the high, raised platform. \nHere, behind a balustrade, sat Umbridge, with Yaxley on one side of her, and Hermione, \nquite as white-faced as Mrs. Cattermole, on the other. At the foot of the platform, a bight-\nsilver, long-haired cat prowled up and down, up and down, and Harry realized that it was \nthere to protect the prosecutors from the despair that emanated from the dementors: That \nwas for the accused to feel, not the accusers. \n\n \u201cSit down,\u201d said Umbridge in her soft, silky voice. \n\n Mrs. Cattermole stumbled to the single seat in the middle of the floor beneath the \nraised platform. The moment she had sat down, chains clinked out of the arms of the \nchair and bound her there. \n\n \u201cYou are Mary Elizabeth Cattermole?\u201d asked Umbridge. \n\n Mrs. Cattermole gave a single, shaky nod. \n\n \u201cMarried to Reginald Cattermole of the Magical Maintenance Department?\u201d \n\n Mrs. Cattermole burst into tears. \n\n \u201cI don\u2019t know where he is, he was supposed to meet me here!\u201d \n\n Umbridge ignored her. \n\n \u201cMother to Maisie, Ellie and Alfred Cattermole?\u201d \nMrs. Cattermole sobbed harder than ever. \n\n \u201cThey\u2019re frightened, they think that I might not come home \u2013\u201c \n\n\f\n \u201cT-took?\u201d sobbed Mrs. Cattermole. \u201cI didn\u2019t t-take it from anybody. I b-bought it \nwhen I was eleven years old. It \u2013 it \u2013 it \u2013 chose me.\u201d \n\n She cried harder than ever. \n\n Umbridge laughed a soft girlish laugh that made Harry want to attack her. She \nleaned forward over the barrier, the better to observe her victim, and something gold \nswung forward too, and dangled over the void: the locket. \n\n Hermione had seen it; she let out a little squeak, but Umbridge and Yaxley, still \nintent upon their prey, were deaf to everything else. \n\n \u201cNo,\u201d said Umbridge, \u201cno, I don\u2019t think so, Mrs. Cattermole. Wands only choose \nwitches or wizards. You are not a witch. I have your responses to the questionnaire that \nwas sent to you here \u2013 Mafalda, pass them to me.\u201d \n\n Umbridge held out a small hand: She looked so toadlike at that moment that \nHarry was quite surprised not to see webs between the stubby fingers. Hermione\u2019s hands \nwere shaking with shock. She fumbled in a pile of documents balanced on the chair \nbeside her, finally withdrawing a sheaf of parchment with Mrs. Cattermole\u2019s name on it. \n\n \u201cThat\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s pretty, Dolores,\u201d she said, pointing at the pendant gleaming in the \nruffled folds of Umbridge\u2019s blouse. \n\n \u201cWhat?\u201d snapped Umbridge, glancing down. \u201cOh yes \u2013 an old family heirloom,\u201d \nshe said, patting the locket lying on her large bosom. \u201cThe S stands for Selwyn\u2026. I am \nrelated to the Selwyns\u2026. Indeed, there are few pure-blood families to whom I am not \nrelated. \u2026A pity,\u201d she continued in a louder voice, flicking through Mrs. Cattermole\u2019s \nquestionnaire, \u201cthat the same cannot be said for you. \u2018Parents professions: \ngreengrocers\u2019.\u201d \n\n Yaxley laughed jeeringly. Below, the fluffy silver cat patrolled up and down, and \nthe dementors stood waiting in the corners. \n\n It was Umbridge\u2019s lie that brought the blood surging into Harry\u2019s brain and \nobliterated his sense of caution \u2013 that the locket she had taken as a bribe from a petty \ncriminal was being used to bolster her own pure-blood credentials. He raised his wand, \nnot even troubling to keep it concealed beneath the Invisibility Cloak, and said, \n\u201cStupefy!\u201d \n\n There was a flash of red light; Umbridge crumpled and her forehead hit the edge \nof the balustrade: Mrs. Cattermole\u2019s papers slid off her lap onto the floor and, down \nbelow, the prowling silver cat vanished. Ice-cold air hit them like an oncoming wind: \nYaxley, confused, looked around for the source of the trouble and saw Harry\u2019s \ndisembodied hand and wand pointing at him. He tried to draw his own wand, but too late: \n\u201cStupefy!\u201d \n\n Yaxley slid to the ground to lie curled on the floor. \n\n \u201cHarry!\u201d \n\n \u201cHermione, if you think I was going to sit here and let her pretend \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cHarry, Mrs. Cattermole!\u201d \n\n Harry whirled around, throwing off the Invisibility Cloak; down below, the \ndementors had moved out of their corners; they were gliding toward the woman chained \nto the chair: Whether because the Patronus had vanished or because they sensed that their \nmasters were no longer in control, they seemed to have abandoned restraint. Mrs. \nCattermole let out a terrible scream of fear as a slimy, scabbed hand grasped her chin and \nforced her face back. \n\n\f\n \u201cEXPECTO PATRONUM!\u201d \n\n The silver stag soared from the tip of Harry\u2019s wand and leaped toward the \ndementors, which fell back and melted into the dark shadows again. The stag\u2019s light, \nmore powerful and more warming than the cat\u2019s protection, filled the whole dungeon as it \ncantered around the room. \n\n \u201cGet the Horcrux,\u201d Harry told Hermione. \n\n He ran back down the steps, stuffing the Invisibility Cloak into his back, and \napproached Mrs. Cattermole. \n\n \u201cYou?\u201d she whispered, gazing into his face. \u201cBut \u2013 but Reg said you were the one \nwho submitted my name for questioning!\u201d \n\n \u201cDid I?\u201d muttered Harry, tugging at the chains binding her arms, \u201cWell, I\u2019ve had \na change of heart. Diffindo!\u201d Nothing happened. \u201cHermione, how do I get rid of these \nchains?\u201d \n\u201cWait, I\u2019m trying something up here \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cHermione, we\u2019re surrounded by dementors!\u201d \n\n \u201cI know that, Harry, but if she wakes up and the locket\u2019s gone \u2013 I need to \nduplicate it \u2013 Geminio! There\u2026 That should fool her\u2026.\u201d \n\n Hermione came running downstairs. \n\n \u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026. Relashio!\u201d \n\n The chains clinked and withdrew into the arms of the chair. Mrs. Cattermole \nlooked just as frightened as ever before. \n\n \u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d she whispered. \n\n \u201cYou\u2019re going to leave here with us,\u201d said Harry, pulling her to her feet. \u201cGo \nhome, grab your children, and get out, get out of the country if you\u2019ve got to. Disguise \nyourselves and run. You\u2019ve seen how it is, you won\u2019t get anything like a fair hearing \nhere.\u201d \n\n \u201cHarry,\u201d said Hermione, \u201chow are we going to get out of here with all those \ndementors outside the door?\u201d \n\n \u201cPatronuses,\u201d said Harry, pointing his wand at his own. The stag slowed and \nwalked, still gleaming brightly, toward the door. \u201cAs many as we can muster; do yours, \nHermione.\u201d \n\n \u201cExpec \u2013 Expecto patronum,\u201d said Hermione. Nothing happened. \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s the only spell she ever has trouble with,\u201d Harry told a completely bemused \nMrs. Cattermole. \u201cBit unfortunate, really\u2026 Come on Hermione\u2026.\u201d \n\n \u2018Expecto patronum!\u201d \n\n A silver otter burst from the end of Hermione\u2019s wand and swam gracefully \nthrough the air to join the stag. \n\n \u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d said Harry, and he led Hermione and Mrs. Cattermole to the door. \n\n When the Patronuses glided out of the dungeon there were cries of shock from the \npeople waiting outside. Harry looked around; the dementors were falling back on both \nsides of them, melding into the darkness, scattering before the silver creatures. \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s been decided that you should all go home and go into hiding with your \nfamilies,\u201d Harry told the waiting Muggle-born, who were dazzled by the light of the \nPatronuses and still cowering slightly. \u201cGo abroad if you can. Just get well away from the \nMinistry. That\u2019s the \u2013 er \u2013 new official position. Now, if you\u2019ll just follow the Patronuses, \nyou\u2019ll be able to leave the Atrium.\u201d \n\n\f\n They managed to get up the stone stops without being intercepted, but as they \napproached the lifts Harry started to have misgivings. If they emerged into the Atrium \nwith a silver stag, and otter soaring alongside it, and twenty or so people, half of them \naccused Muggle-borns, he could not help feeling that they would attract unwanted \nattention. He had just reached this unwelcome conclusion when the lift clanged to a halt \nin front of them. \n\n \u201cReg!\u201d screamed Mrs. Cattermole, and she threw herself into Ron\u2019s arms. \n\u201cRuncorn let me out, he attacked Umbridge and Yaxley, and he\u2019s told all of us to leave \nthe country. I think we\u2019d better do it, Reg, I really do, let\u2019s hurry home and fetch the \nchildren and \u2013 why are you so wet?\u201d \n\n \u201cWater,\u201d muttered Ron, disengaging himself. \u201cHarry, they know there are \nintruders inside the Ministry, something about a hole in Umbridge\u2019s office door. I reckon \nwe\u2019ve got five minutes if that \u2013\u201c \n\n Hermione\u2019s Patronus vanished with a pop as she turned a horror struck face to \nHarry. \n\n \u201cHarry, if we\u2019re trapped here \u2013 !\u201d \n\n \u201cWe won\u2019t be if we move fast,\u201d said Harry. He addressed the silent group behind \nthem, who were all gawping at him. \n\n \u201cWho\u2019s got wands?\u201d \n\n About half of them raised their hands. \n\n \u201cOkay, all of you who haven\u2019t got wands need to attach yourself to somebody \nwho has. We\u2019ll need to be fast before they stop us. Come on.\u201d \n\n They managed to cram themselves into two lifts. Harry\u2019s Patronus stood sentinel \nbefore the golden grilles as they shut and the lifts began to rise. \n\n \u201cLevel eight,\u201d said the witch\u2019s cool voice, \u201cAtrium.\u201d \n\n Harry knew at once that they were in trouble. The Atrium was full of people \nmoving from fireplace to fireplace, sealing them off. \n\n \u201cHarry!\u201d squeaked Hermione. \u201cWhat are we going to \u2013 ?\u201d \n\n \u201cSTOP!\u201d Harry thundered, and the powerful voice of Runcorn echoed through the \nAtrium: The wizards sealing the fireplaces froze. \u201cFollow me,\u201d he whispered to the group \nof terrified Muggle-borns, who moved forward in a huddle, shepherded by Ron and \nHermione. \n\n \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Albert?\u201d said the same balding wizard who had followed Harry out \nof the fireplace earlier. He looked nervous. \n\n \u201cThis lot need to leave before you seal the exits,\u201d said Harry with all the authority \nhe could muster. \n\n The group of wizards in front of him looked at one another. \n\n \u201cWe\u2019ve been told to seal all exits and not let anyone \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cAre you contradicting me?\u201d Harry blustered. \u201cWould you like me to have your \nfamily tree examined, like I had Dirk Cresswell\u2019s?\u201d \n\n \u201cSorry!\u201d gasped the balding wizard, backing away. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean nothing, Albert, \nbut I thought\u2026 I thought they were in for questioning and\u2026\u201d \n\n \u201cTheir blood is pure,\u201d said Harry, and his deep voice echoed impressively through \nthe hall. \u201cPurer than many of yours, I daresay. Off you go,\u201d he boomed to the Muggle-\nborns, who scurried forward into the fireplaces and began to vanish in pairs. The Ministry \nwizards hung back, some looking confused, others scared and fearful. Then: \n\n\f\n \u201cMary!\u201d \n\n Mrs. Cattermole looked over her shoulder. The real Reg Cattermole, no longer \nvomiting but pale and wan, had just come running out of a lift. \n\n \u201cR- Reg?\u201d \n\n She looked from her husband to Ron, who swore loudly. \n\n The balding wizard gaped, his head turning ludicrously from one Reg Cattermole \nto the other. \n\n \u201cHey \u2013 what\u2019s going on? What is this?\u201d \n\n \u201cSeal the exit! SEAL IT!\u201d \n\n Yaxley had burst out of another lift and was running toward the group beside the \nfireplaces, into which all of the Muggle-borns but Mrs. Cattermole had now vanished. As \nthe balding wizard lifted his wand, Harry raised an enormous fist and punched him, \nsending him flying through the air. \n\n \u201cHe\u2019s been helping Muggle-borns escape, Yaxley!\u201d Harry shouted. \n\n The balding wizard\u2019s colleagues set up and uproar, under cover of which Ron \ngrabbed Mrs. Cattermole, pulled her into the still-open fireplace, and disappeared. \nConfused, Yaxley looked from Harry to the punched wizard, while the real Reg \nCattermole screamed, \u201cMy wife! Who was that with my wife? What\u2019s going on?\u201d \n\n Harry saw Yaxley\u2019s head turn, saw an inkling of truth dawn on that brutish face. \n\n \u201cCome on!\u201d Harry shouted at Hermione; he seized her hand and they jumped into \nthe fireplace together as Yaxley\u2019s curse sailed over Harry\u2019s head. They spun for a few \nseconds before shooting up out of a toilet into a cubicle. Harry flung open the door: Ron \nwas standing there beside the sinks, still wrestling with Mrs. Cattermole. \n\n \u201cReg, I don\u2019t understand \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cLet go, I\u2019m not your husband, you\u2019ve got to go home!\u201d \n\n There was a noise in the cubicle behind them; Harry looked around; Yaxley had \njust appeared. \n\n \u201cLET\u2019S GO!\u201d Harry yelled. He seized Hermione by the hand and Ron by the arm \nand turned on the stop. \n\n Darkness engulfed them, along with the sensation of compressing hands, but \nsomething was wrong\u2026. Hermione\u2019s hand seemed to be sliding out of his grip\u2026. \n\n He wondered whether he was going to suffocate; he could not breathe or see and \nthe only solid things in the world were Ron\u2019s arm and Hermione\u2019s fingers, which were \nslowly slipping away\u2026. \n\n And then he saw the door to number twelve, Grimmauld Place, with its serpent \ndoor knocker, but before he could draw breath, there was a scream and a flash of purple \nlight: Hermione\u2019s hand was suddenly vicelike upon his and everything went dark again. \n\nChapter Fourteen \n\nThe Thief \n\n \n\nHarry opened his eyes and was dazzled by gold and green; he had no idea what \nhad happened, he only knew that he was lying on what seemed to be leaves and twigs. \nStruggling to draw breath into lungs that felt flattened, he blinked and realized that the \ngaudy glare was sunlight streaming through a canopy of leaves far above him. Then an \n\n\f\nobject twitched close to his face. He pushed himself onto his hands and knees, ready to \nface some small, fierce creature, but saw that the object was Ron\u2019s foot. Looking around, \nHarry saw that they and Hermione were lying on a forest floor, apparently alone. \n\n Harry\u2019s first thought was of the Forbidden Forest, and for a moment, even though \nhe knew how foolish and dangerous it would be for them to appear in the grounds of \nHogwarts, his heart leapt at the thought of sneaking through the trees to Hagrid\u2019s hut. \nHowever, in the few moments it took for Ron to give a low groan and Harry to start \ncrawling toward him, he realized that this was not the Forbidden Forest; The trees looked \nyounger, they were more widely spaced, the ground clearer. \n\n He met Hermione, also on her hands and knees, at Ron\u2019s head. The moment his \neyes fell upon Ron, all other concerns fled Harry\u2019s mind, for blood drenched the whole of \nRon\u2019s left side and his face stood out, grayish-white, against the leaf-strewn earth. The \nPolyjuice Potion was wearing off now: Ron was halfway between Cattermole and himself \nin appearance, his hair turning redder and redder as his face drained of the little color it \nhad left. \n\n \u201cWhat\u2019s happened to him?\u201d \n\n \u201cSplinched,\u201d said Hermione, her fingers already busy at Ron\u2019s sleeve, where the \nblood was wettest and darkest. \n\n Harry watched, horrified, as she tore open Ron\u2019s short. He had always thought of \nSplinching as something comical, but this . . . His insides crawled unpleasantly as \nHermione laid bare Ron\u2019s upper arm, where a great chunk of flesh was missing, scooped \ncleanly away as though by a knife. \n\n \u201cHarry, quickly, in my bag, there\u2019s a small bottle labeled \u2018Essence of Dittany\u2019\u2013 \u201c \n\n \u201cBag \u2013 right \u2013\u201c \n\n Harry sped to the place where Hermione had landed, seized the tiny beaded bag, \nand thrust his hand inside it. At once, object after object began presenting itself to his \ntouch: He felt the leather spines of books, woolly sleeves of jumpers, heels of shoes \u2013 \n\n \u201cQuickly!\u201d \n\n He grabbed his wand from the ground and pointed it into the depths of the \nmagical bag. \n\n \u201cAccio Dittany!\u201d \n\n A small brown bottle zoomed out of the bag; he caught it and hastened back to \nHermione and Ron, whose eyes were now half-closed, strips of white eyeball all that \nwere visible between his lids. \n\n \u201cHe\u2019s fainted,\u201d said Hermione, who was also rather pale; she no longer looked \nlike Mafalda, though her hair was still gray in places. \u201cUnstopper it for me, Harry, my \nhands are shaking.\u201d \n\n Harry wrenched the stopper off the little bottle, Hermione took it and poured three \ndrops of the potion onto the bleeding wound. Greenish smoke billowed upward and when \nit had cleared, Harry saw that the bleeding had stopped. The wound now looked several \ndays old; new skin stretched over what had just been open flesh. \n\n \u201cWow,\u201d said Harry. \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s all I feel safe doing,\u201d said Hermione shakily. \u201cThere are spells that would put \nhim completely right, but I daren\u2019t try in case I do them wrong and cause more \ndamage. . . . He\u2019s lost so much blood already. . . .\u201d \n\n\f\n \u201cHow did he get hurt? I mean\u201d \u2013 Harry shook his head, trying to clear it, to make \nsense of whatever had just taken place \u2013 \u201cwhy are we here? I thought we were going back \nto Grimmauld Place?\u201d \n\n Hermione took a deep breath. She looked close to tears. \n\n \u201cHarry, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be able to go back there.\u201d \n\n \u201cWhat d\u2019you \u2013 ?\u201d \n\n \u201cAs we Disapparated, Yaxley caught hold of me and I couldn\u2019t get rid of him, he \nwas too strong, and he was still holding on when we arrived at Grimmauld Place, and \nthen \u2013 well, I think he must have seen the door, and thought we were stopping there, so \nhe slackened his grip and I managed to sake him off and I brought us here instead!\u201d \n\n \u201cBut then, where\u2019s he? Hang on. . . . You don\u2019t mean he\u2019s at Grimmauld Place? \nHe can\u2019t get in there?\u201d \n\n Her eyes sparkled with unshed tears as she nodded. \n\n \u201cHarry, I think he can. I \u2013 I forced him to let go with a Revulsion Jinx, but I\u2019d \nalready taken him inside the Fidelius Charm\u2019s protection. Since Dumbledore died, we\u2019re \nSecret-Keepers, so I\u2019ve given him the secret, haven\u2019t I?\u201d \n\n There was no pretending; Harry was sure she was right. It was a serious blow. If \nYaxley could now get inside the house, there was no way that they could return. Even \nnow, he could be bringing other Death Eaters in there by Apparition. Gloomy and \noppressive though the house was, it had been their one safe refuge; even, now that \nKreacher was so much happier and friendlier, a kind of home. With a twinge of regret \nthat had nothing to do with food, Harry imagined the house-elf busying himself over the \nsteak-and-kidney pie that Harry, Ron, and Hermione would never eat. \n\n \u201cHarry, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d \n\n \u201cDon\u2019t be stupid, it wasn\u2019t your fault! If anything, it was mine. . . .\u201d \n\n Harry put his hand in his pocket and drew out Mad-Eye\u2019s eye. Hermione recoiled, \nlooking horrified. \n\n \u201cUmbridge had stuck it to her office door, to spy on people. I couldn\u2019t leave it \nthere . . . but that\u2019s how they knew there were intruders.\u201d \n\n Before Hermione could answer, Ron groaned and opened his eyes. He was still \ngray and his face glistened with sweat. \n\n \u201cHow d\u2019you feel?\u201d Hermione whispered. \n\n \u201cLousy,\u201d croaked Ron, wincing as he felt his injured arm. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d \n\n \u201cIn the woods where they held the Quidditch World Cup,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cI \nwanted somewhere enclosed, undercover, and this was \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201c\u2013 the first place you thought of,\u201d Harry finished for her, glancing around at the \napparently deserted glade. He could not help remembering what had happened the last \ntime they had Apparated to the first place Hermione had thought of \u2013 how Death Eaters \nhad found them within minutes. Had it been Legilimency? Did Voldemort or his \nhenchmen know, even now, where Hermione had taken them? \n\n \u201cD\u2019you reckon we should move on?\u201d Ron asked Harry, and Harry could tell by \nthe look on Ron\u2019s face that he was thinking the same. \n\n \u201cI dunno.\u201d \nRon still looked pale and clammy. He had made no attempt to sit up and it looked \nas though he was too weak to do so. The prospect of moving him was daunting. \n\n \u201cLet\u2019s stay here for now,\u201d Harry said. \n\n\f\n Looking relieved, Hermione sprang to her feet. \n\n \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d asked Ron. \n\n \u201cIf we\u2019re staying, we should put some protective enchantments around the place,\u201d \nshe replied, and raising her wand, she began to walk in a wide circle around Harry and \nRon, murmuring incantations as she went. Harry saw little disturbances in the \nsurrounding air: It was as if Hermione had cast a heat haze upon their clearing. \n\n \u201cSalvio Hexia . . . Protego Totalum . . . Repello Muggletum . . . Muffliato . . . You \ncould get out the tent, Harry. . . .\u201d \n\n \u201cTent?\u201d \n\n \u201cIn the bag!\u201d \n\n \u201cIn the . . . of course,\u201d said Harry. \n\n He did not bother to grope inside it this time, but used another Summoning Charm. \nThe tent emerged in a lumpy mass of canvas, ropes, and poles. Harry recognized it, partly \nbecause of the smell of cats, as the same tent in which they had slept on the night of the \nQuidditch World Cup. \n\n \u201cI thought this belonged to that bloke Perkins at the Ministry?\u201d he asked, starting \nto disentangle the pent pegs. \n\n \u201cApparently he didn\u2019t want it back, his lumbago\u2019s so bad,\u201d said Hermione, now \nperforming complicated figure-of-eight movements with her wand. \u201cso Ron\u2019s dad said I \ncould borrow it. Erecto!\u201d she added, pointing her wand at the misshapen canvas, which in \none fluid motion rose into the air and settled, fully constructed, onto the ground before \nHarry, out of whose startled hands a tent peg soared, to land with a final thud at the end \nof a guy rope. \n\n \u201cCave Inimicum,\u201d Hermione finished with a skyward flourish. \u201cThat\u2019s as much as \nI can do. At the very least, we should know they\u2019re coming; I can\u2019t guarantee it will keep \nout Vol \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cDon\u2019t say the name!\u201d Ron cut across her, his voice harsh. \n\n Harry and Hermione looked at each other. \n\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Ron said, moaning a little as he raised himself to look at them, \u201cbut it \nfeels like a \u2013 a jinx or something. Can\u2019t we call him You-Know-Who \u2013 please?\u201d \n\n \u201cDumbledore said fear of a name \u2013\u201c began Harry. \n\n \u201cIn case you hadn\u2019t noticed, mate, calling You-Know-Who by his name didn\u2019t do \nDumbledore much good in the end,\u201d Ron snapped back. \u201cJust \u2013 just show You-Know-\nWho some respect, will you?\u201d \n\n \u201cRespect?\u201d Harry repeated, but Hermione shot him a warning look; apparently he \nwas not to argue with Ron while the latter was in such a weakened condition. \n\n Harry and Hermione half carried, half dragged Ron through the entrance of the \ntent. The interior was exactly as Harry remembered it; a small flat, complete with \nbathroom and tiny kitchen. He shoved aside an old armchair and lowered Ron carefully \nonto the lower berth of a bunk bed. Even this very short journey had turned Ron whiter \nstill, and once they had settled him on the mattress he closed his eyes again and did not \nspeak for a while. \n\n \u201cI\u2019ll make some tea,\u201d said Hermione breathlessly, pulling kettle and mugs from \nthe depths of her bag and heading toward the kitchen. \n\n\f\n Harry found the hot drink as welcome as the firewhisky had been on the night that \nMad-Eye had died; it seemed to burn away a little of the fear fluttering in his chest. After \na minute or two, Ron broke the silence. \n\n \u201cWhat d\u2019you reckon happened to the Cattermoles?\u201d \n\n \u201cWith any luck, they\u2019ll have got away,\u201d said Hermione, clutching her hot mug for \ncomfort. \u201cAs long as Mr. Cattermole had his wits about him, he\u2019ll have transported Mrs. \nCattermole by Side-Along-Apparition and they\u2019ll be fleeing the country right now with \ntheir children. That\u2019s what Harry told her to do.\u201d \n\n \u201cBlimey, I hope they escaped,\u201d said Ron, leaning back on his pillows. The tea \nseemed to be doing him good; a little of his color had returned. \u201cI didn\u2019t get the feeling \nReg Cattermole was all that quick-witted, though, the way everyone was talking to me \nwhen I was him. God, I hope they made it. . . . If they both end up in Azkaban because of \nus . . .\u201d \n\n Harry looked over at Hermione and the question he had been about to ask \u2013 about \nwhether Mrs. Cattermole\u2019s lack of a wand would prevent her Apparating alongside her \nhusband \u2013 died in his throat. Hermione was watching Ron fret over the fate of the \nCattermoles, and there was such tenderness in her expression that Harry felt almost as if \nhe had surprised her in the act of kissing him. \n\n \u201cSo, have you got it?\u201d Harry asked her, partly to remind her that he was there. \n\n \u201cGot \u2013 got what?\u201d she said with a little start. \n\n \u201cWhat did we just go through all that for? The locket! Where\u2019s the locket?\u201d \n\n \u201cYou got it?\u201d shouted Ron, raising himself a little higher on his pillows. \u201cNo one \ntells me anything! Blimey, you could have mentioned it!\u201d \n\u201cWell, we were running for our lives from the Death Eaters, weren\u2019t we?\u201d said \nHermione. \u201cHere.\u201d \n\n And she pulled the locket out of the pocket of her robes and handed it to Ron. \n\n It was as large as a chicken\u2019s egg. An ornate letter S, inlaid with many small green \nstones, glinted dully in the diffused light shining through the tent\u2019s canvas roof. \n\n \u201cThere isn\u2019t any chance someone\u2019s destroyed it since Kreacher had it?\u201d asked \nRon hopefully. \u201cI mean, are we sure it\u2019s still a Horcrux?\u201d \n\n \u201cI think so,\u201d said Hermione, taking it back from him and looking at it closely. \n\u201cThere\u2019d be some sign of damage if it had been magically destroyed.\u201d \n\n She passed it to Harry, who turned it over in his fingers. The thing looked perfect, \npristine. He remembered the mangled remains of the diary, and how the stone in the \nHorcrux ring had been cracked open when Dumbledore destroyed it. \n\n \u201cI reckon Kreacher\u2019s right,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to work out how to \nopen this thing before we can destroy it.\u201d \n\n Sudden awareness of what he was holding, of what lived behind the little golden \ndoors, hit Harry as he spoke. Even after all their efforts to find it, he felt a violent urge to \nfling the locket from him. Mastering himself again, he tried to prise the locket apart with \nhis fingers, then attempted the charm Hermione had used to open Regulus\u2019s bedroom \ndoor. Neither worked. He handed the locket back to Ron and Hermione, each of whom \ndid their best, but were no more successful at opening it than he had been. \n\n \u201cCan you feel it, though?\u201d Ron asked in a hushed voice, as he held it tight in his \nclenched fist. \n\n\f\n \u201cWhat d\u2019you mean?\u201d \nRon passed the Horcrux to Harry. After a moment or two, Harry thought he knew \nwhat Ron meant. Was it his own blood pulsing through his veins that he could feel, or \nwas it something beating inside the locket, like a tiny metal heart? \n\n \u201cWhat are we going to do with it?\u201d Hermione asked. \n\n \u201cKeep it safe till we work out how to destroy it.\u201d Harry replied, and, little though \nhe wanted to, he hung the chain around his own neck, dropping the locket out of sight \nbeneath his robes, where it rested against his chest beside the pouch Hagrid had given \nhim. \n\n \u201cI think we should take it in turns to keep watch outside the tent,\u201d he added to \nHermione, standing up and stretching. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll need to think about some food as well. \nYou stay there,\u201d he added sharply, as Ron attempted to sit up and turned a nasty shade of \ngreen. \n\n With the Sneakoscope Hermione had given Harry for his birthday set carefully \nupon the table in the tent, Harry and Hermione spent the rest of the day sharing the role \nof lookout. However, the Sneakoscope remained silent and still upon its point all day, and \nwhether because of the protective enchantments and Muggle-repelling charms Hermione \nhad spread around them, or because people rarely ventured this way, their patch of wood \nremained deserted, apart from occasional birds and squirrels. Evening brought no change; \nHarry lit his wand as he swapped places with Hermione at ten o\u2019clock, and looked out \nupon a deserted scene, noting the bats fluttering high above him across the single patch of \nstarry sky visible from their protected clearing. \n\n He felt hungry now, and a little light-headed. Hermione had not packed any food \nin her magical bag, as she had assumed that they would be returning to Grimmauld Place \nthat night, so they had had nothing to eat except some wild mushrooms that Hermione \nhad collected from amongst the nearest trees and stewed in a Billycan. After a couple of \nmouthfuls Ron had pushed his portion away, looking queasy; Harry had only persevered \nso as to not hurt Hermione\u2019s feelings. \n\n The surrounding silence was broken by odd rustlings and what sounded like \ncrackings of twigs: Harry thought that they were caused by animals rather than people, \nyet he kept his wand held tight at the ready. His insides, already uncomfortable due to \ntheir inadequate helping of rubbery mushrooms, tingled with unease. \n\n He had though that he would feel elated if they managed to steal back the Horcrux, \nbut somehow he did not; all he felt as he sat looking out at the darkness, of which his \nwand lit only a tiny part, was worry about what would happen next. It was as though he \nhad been hurtling toward this point for weeks, months, maybe even years, but how he had \ncome to an abrupt halt, run out of road. \n\n There were other Horcruxes out there somewhere, but he did not have the faintest \nidea where they could be. He did not even know what all of them were. Meanwhile he \nwas at a loss to know how to destroy the only one that they had found, the Horcrux that \ncurrently lay against the bare flesh of his chest. Curiously, it had not taken heat from his \nbody, but lay so cold against his skin it might just have emerged from icy water. From \ntime to time Harry thought, or perhaps imagined, that he could feel the tiny heartbeat \nticking irregularly alongside his own. Nameless forebodings crept upon him as he sat \nthere in the dark. He tried to resist them, push them away, yet they came at him \nrelentlessly. Neither can live while the other survives. Ron and Hermione, now talking \n\n\f\nsoftly behind him in the tent, could walk away if they wanted to: He could not. And it \nseemed to Harry as he sat there trying to master his own fear and exhaustion, that the \nHorcrux against his chest was ticking away the time he had left. . . . Stupid idea, he told \nhimself, don\u2019t think that. . . . \n\n His scar was starting to prickle again. He was afraid that he was making it happen \nby having these thoughts, and tried to direct them into another channel. He thought of \npoor Kreacher, who had expected them home and had received Yaxley instead. Would \nthe elf keep silent or would he tell the Death Eater everything he knew? Harry wanted to \nbelieve that Kreacher had changed towards him in the past month, that he would be loyal \nnow, but who knew what would happen? What if the Death Eaters tortured the elf? Sick \nimages swarmed into Harry\u2019s head and he tried to push these away too, for there was \nnothing he could do for Kreacher: He and Hermione had already decided against trying to \nsummon him; what if someone from the Ministry came too? They could not count on \nelfish Apparition being free from the same flaw that had taken Yaxley to Grimmauld \nPlace on the hem of Hermione\u2019s sleeve. \n\n Harry\u2019s scar was burning now. He thought that there was so much they did not \nknow: Lupin had been right about magic they had never encountered or imagined. Why \nhadn\u2019t Dumbledore explained more? Had he thought that there would be time; that he \nwould live for years, for centuries perhaps, like his friend Nicolas Flamel? If so, he had \nbeen wrong. . . . Snape had seen to that. . . . Snape, the sleeping snake, who had struck at \nthe top of the tower . . . \n\n And Dumbledore had fallen . . . fallen . . . \n\n \u201cGive it to me, Gregorovitch.\u201d \n\n Harry\u2019s voice was high, clear, and cold, his wand held in front of him by a long-\nfingered white hand. The man at whom he was pointing was suspended upside down in \nmidair, though there were no ropes holding him; he swung there, invisibly and eerily \nbound, his limbs wrapped about him, his terrified face, on a level with Harry\u2019s ruddy due \nto the blood that had rushed to his head. He had pure-white hair and a thick, bushy beard: \na trussed-up Father Christmas. \n\n \u201cI have it not, I have it no more! It was, many years ago, stolen from me!\u201d \n\n \u201cDo not lie to Lord Voldemort, Gregorovitch. He knows. . . . He always knows.\u201d \nThe hanging man\u2019s pupils were wide, dilated with fear, and they seemed to swell, \nbigger and bigger until their blackness swallowed Harry whole \u2013 \n\n And how Harry was hurrying along a dark corridor in stout little Gregorovitch\u2019s \nwake as he held a lantern aloft: Gregorovitch burst into the room at the end of the passage \nand his lantern illuminated what looked like a workshop; wood shavings and gold \ngleamed in the swinging pool of light, and there on the window ledge sat perched, like a \ngiant bird, a young man with golden hair. In the split second that the lantern\u2019s light \nilluminated him, Harry saw the delight upon his handsome face, then the intruder shot a \nStunning Spell from his wand and jumped neatly backward out of the window with a \ncrow of laughter. \n\n And Harry was hurtling back out of those wide, tunnellike pupils and \nGregorovitch\u2019s face was stricken with terror. \n\n \u201cWho was the thief, Gregorovitch?\u201d said the high cold voice. \n\n \u201cI do not know, I never knew, a young man \u2013 no \u2013 please \u2013 PLEASE!\u201d \n\n A scream that went on and on and then a burst of green light \u2013 \n\n\f\n \u201cHarry!\u201d \n\n He opened his eyes, panting, his forehead throbbing. He had passed out against \nthe side of the tent, had slid sideways down the canvas, and was sprawled on the ground. \nHe looked up at Hermione, whose bushy hair obscured the tiny patch of sky visible \nthrough the dark branches high above them. \n\n \u201cDream,\u201d he said, sitting up quickly and attempting to meet Hermione\u2019s glower \nwith a look of innocence. \u201cMust\u2019ve dozed off, sorry.\u201d \n\n \u201cI know it was your scar! I can tell by the look on your face! You were looking \ninto Vol \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cDon\u2019t say his name!\u201d came Ron\u2019s angry voice from the depths of the tent. \n\n \u201cFine,\u201d retorted Hermione, \u201cYou-Know-Who\u2019s mind, then!\u201d \n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it to happen!\u201d Harry said. \u201cIt was a dream! Can you control what \nyou dream about, Hermione?\u201d \n\n \u201cIf you just learned to apply Occlumency \u2013\u201c \n\n But Harry was not interested in being told off; he wanted to discuss what he had \njust seen. \n\n \u201cHe\u2019s found Gregorovitch, Hermione, and I think he\u2019s killed him, but before he \nkilled him he read Gregorovitch\u2019s mind and I saw \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cI think I\u2019d better take over the watch if you\u2019re so tired you\u2019re falling sleep,\u201d said \nHermione coldly. \n\n \u201cI can finish the watch!\u201d \n\n \u201cNo, you\u2019re obviously exhausted. Go and lie down.\u201d \n\n She dropped down in the mouth of the tent, looking stubborn. Angry, but wishing \nto avoid a row, Harry ducked back inside. \n\n Ron\u2019s still-pale face was poking out from the lower bunk; Harry climbed into the \none above him, lay down, and looked up at the dark canvas ceiling. After several \nmoments, Ron spoke in a voice so low that it would not carry to Hermione, huddle in the \nentrance. \n\n \u201cWhat\u2019s You-Know-Who doing?\u201d \n\n Harry screwed up his eyes in the effort to remember every detail, then whispered \ninto the darkness. \n\n \u201cHe found Gregorovitch. He had him tied up, he was torturing him.\u201d \n\u201cHow\u2019s Gregorovitch supposed to make him a new wand if he\u2019s tied up?\u201d \n\n \u201cI dunno. . . . It\u2019s weird, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \n\n Harry closed his eyes, thinking of all that he had seen and heard. The more he \nrecalled, the less sense it made. . . . Voldemort had said nothing about Harry\u2019s wand, \nnothing about the twin cores, nothing about Gregorovitch making a new and more \npowerful wand to beat Harry\u2019s. . . . \n\n \u201cHe wanted something from Gregorovitch,\u201d Harry said, eyes still closed tight. \n\u201cHe asked him to hand it over, but Gregorovitch said it had been stolen from him . . . and \nthen . . . then . . .\u201d \n\n He remembered how he, as Voldemort, had seemed to hurtle through \nGregorovitch\u2019s eyes, into his memories. . . . \n\n \u201cHe read Gregorovitch\u2019s mind, and I saw this young bloke perched on a \nwindowsill, and he fired a curse at Gregorovitch and jumped out of sight. He stole it, he \nstole whatever You-Know-Who\u2019s after. And I . . . I think I\u2019ve seen him somewhere. . . .\u201d \n\n\f\n Harry wished he could have another glimpse of the laughing boy\u2019s face. The theft \nhad happened many years ago, according to Gregorovitch. Why did the young thief look \nfamiliar? \n\n The noises of the surrounding woods were muffled inside the tent; all Harry could \nhear was Ron\u2019s breathing. After a while, Ron whispered, \u201cCouldn\u2019t you see what the \nthief was holding?\u201d \n\n \u201cNo . . . it must\u2019ve been something small.\u201d \n\n \u201cHarry?\u201d \n\n The wooden slats of Ron\u2019s bunk creaked as he repositioned himself in bed. \n\n \u201cHarry, you don\u2019t reckon You-Know-Who\u2019s after something else to turn into a \nHorcrux?\u201d \n\n \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Harry slowly. \u201cMaybe. But wouldn\u2019t it be dangerous for him \nto make another one? Didn\u2019t Hermione say he had pushed his soul to the limit already?\u201d \n\n \u201cYeah, but maybe he doesn\u2019t know that.\u201d \n\n \u201cYeah . . .maybe,\u201d said Harry. \n\n He had been sure that Voldemort had been looking for a way around the problem \nof the twin cores, sure that Voldemort sought a solution from the old wandmaker . . . and \nyet he had killed him, apparently without asking him a single question about wandlore. \n\n What was Voldemort trying to find? Why, with the Ministry of Magic and the \nWizarding world at his feet, was he far away, intent on the pursuit of an object that \nGregorovitch had once owned, and which had been stolen by the unknown thief? \n\n Harry could still see the blond-haired youth\u2019s face; it was merry, wild; there was a \nFred and George-ish air of triumphant trickery about him. He had soared from the \nwindowsill like a bird, and Harry had seen him before, but he could not think where. . . . \n\n With Gregorovitch dead, it was the merry-faced thief who was in danger now, and \nit was on him that Harry\u2019s thoughts dwelled, as Ron\u2019s snores began to rumble from the \nlower bunk and as he himself drifted slowly into sleep once more. \n\n \n\nChapter Fifteen \n\nThe Goblin\u2019s Revenge \n\n \n\n Early next morning, before the other two were awake, Harry left the tent to search \nthe woods around them for the oldest, most gnarled, and resilient-looking tree he could \nfind. There in its shadows he buried Mad-Eye Moody's eye and marked the spot by \ngouging a small cross in the bark with his wand. It was not much, but Harry felt that \nMad-Eye would have much preferred this to being stuck on Dolores Umbridge's door. \nThen he returned to the tent to wait for the others to wake, and discuss what they were \ngoing to do next. \n\n Harry and Hermione felt that it was best not to stay anywhere too long, and Ron \nagreed, wit the sole proviso that their next move took them within reach of a bacon \nsandwich. Hermione therefore removed the enchantments she had placed around the \nclearing, while Harry and Ron obliterated all the marks and impressions on the ground \nthat might show they had camped there. Then they Disapparated to the outskirts of a \nsmall market town. \n\n\f\n Once they had pitched the tent in the shelter of a small copse of trees and \nsurrounded it with freshly cast defensive enchantments. Harry ventured out under the \nInvisibility Cloak to find sustenance. This, however, did not go as planned. He had barely \nentered the town when an unnatural chill, a descending mist, and a sudden darkening of \nthe skies made him freeze where he stood. \n\n\"But you can make a brilliant Patronus!\" protested Ron, when Harry arrived back at the \ntent empty handed, out of breath, and mouthing the single word, dementors. \n\n \"I couldn't . . . make one.\" he panted, clutching the stitch in his side. \"Wouldn't . . . \ncome.\" \n\nTheir expressions of consternation and disappointment made Harry feel ashamed. It had \nbeen a nightmarish experience, seeing the dementors gliding out of the must in the \ndistance and realizing, as the paralyzing cold choked his lungs and a distant screaming \nfilled his ears, that he was not going to be able to protect himself. It had taken all Harry's \nwillpower to uproot himself from the spot and run, leaving the eyeless dementors to glide \namongst the Muggles who might not be able to see them, but would assuredly feel the \ndespair they cast wherever they went. \n\n \"So we still haven't got any food.\" \n\n \"Shut up, Ron,\" snapped Hermione. \"Harry, what happened? Why do you think \nyou couldn't make your Patronus? You managed perfectly yesterday!\" \n\n \"I don't know.\" \n\n He sat low in one of Perkins's old armchairs, feeling more humiliated by the \nmoment. He was afraid that something had gone wrong inside him. Yesterday seemed a \nlong time ago: Today me might have been thirteen years old again, the only one who \ncollapsed on the Hogwarts Express. \n\n Ron kicked a chair leg. \n\n \"What?\" he snarled at Hermione. \"I'm starving! All I've had since I bled half to \ndeath is a couple of toadstools!\" \n\n \"You go and fight your way through the dementors, then,\" said Harry, stung. \n\n \"I would, but my arm's in a sling, in case you hadn't noticed!\" \n\n \"That's convenient.\" \n\n \"And what's that supposed to \u2014 ?\" \n\n \"Of course!\" cried Hermione, clapping a hand to her forehead and startling both \nof them into silence. \"Harry, give me the locket! Come on,\" she said impatiently, clicking \nher fingers at him when he did not react,\" to Horcrux, Harry, you're still wearing it!\" \n\n She held out her hands, and Harry lifted the golden chain over his head. The \nmoment it parted contact with Harry's skin he free and oddly light. He had not even \nrealized that he was clammy or that there was a heavy weight pressing on his stomach \nuntil both sensations lifted. \n\n \"Better?\" asked Hermione. \n\n \"Yeah, loads better!\" \n\n \"Harry,\" she said, crouching down in front of him and using the kind of voice he \nassociated with visiting the very sick, \"you don't think you've been possessed, do you?\" \n\n \"What? No!\" he said defensively, \"I remember everything we've done while I've \nbee wearing it. I wouldn't know what I'd done if I'd been possessed, would I? Ginny told \nme there were times when she couldn't remember anything.\" \n\n\f\n \"Hmm,\" said Hermione, looking down at the heavy locket. \"Well, maybe we \nought not to wear it. We can just keep it in the tent.\" \n\n \"We are not leaving that Horcrux lying around,\" Harry stated firmly. \"If we lose it, \nif it gets stolen\u2014\" \n\n \"Oh, all right, all right,\" said Hermione, and she placed it around her own neck \nand tucked it out of sight down the front of her shirt. \"But we'll take turns wearing it, so \nnobody keeps it on too long.\" \n\n \"Great,\" said Ron irritably, \"and now we've sorted that out, can we please get \nsome food?\" \n\n \"Fine, but we'll go somewhere else to find it,\" said Hermione with half a glance at \nHarry. \"There's no point staying where we know dementors are swooping around.\" \n\n In the end they settled down for the night in a far flung field belonging to a lonely \nfarm, from which they had managed to obtain eggs and bread. \n\n \"It's not stealing, is it?\" asked Hermione in a troubled voice, as they devoured \nscrambled eggs on toast. \"Not if I left some money under the chicken coo?\" \n\n Ron rolled his eyes and said, with his cheeks bulging, \"Er-my-nee, 'oo worry 'oo \nmuch. 'Elax!\" \n\n And, indeed, it was much easier to relax when they were comfortably well fed. \nThe argument about the dementors was forgotten in laughter that night, and Harry felt \ncheerful, even hopeful, as he took the first of the three night watches. \n\n This was their first encounter with the fact that a full stomach meant good spirits, \nan empty one, bickering and gloom. Harry was least surprised by this, because be had \nsuffered periods of near starvation at the Dursleys\u2019. Hermione bore up reasonably well on \nthose nights when they managed to scavenge nothing but berries or stale biscuits, her \ntemper perhaps a little shorter than usual and her silences dour. Ron, however, had \nalways been used to three delicious meals a day, courtesy of his mother or of the \nHogwarts house-elves, and hunger made him both unreasonable and irascible. Whenever \nlack of food coincided with Ron's turn to wear the Horcrux, he became downright \nunpleasant. \n\n \"So where next?\" was his constant refrain. He did not seem to have any ideas \nhimself, but expected Harry and Hermione to come up with plans while he sat and \nbrooded over the low food supplies. Accordingly Harry and Hermione spent fruitless \nhours trying to decide where they might find the other Horcruxes, and how to destroy the \none they already got, their conversations becoming increasingly repetitive as they got no \nnew information. \n\n As Dumbledore had told Harry that be believed Voldemort had hidden the \nHorcruxes in places important to him, they kept reciting, in a sort of dreary litany, those \nlocations they knew that Voldemort had lived or visited. The orphanage where he had \nbeen born and raised: Hogwarts, where he had been educated; Borgin and Burks, where \nhe had worked after completing school; then Albania, where he had spent his years of \nexile: These formed the basis of their speculations. \n\n \"Yeah, let's go to Albania. Shouldn't take more than an afternoon to search an \nentire country,\" said Ron sarcastically. \n\n \"There can't be anything there. He'd already made five of his Horcruxes before he \nwent into exile, and Dumbledore was certain the snake is the sixth,\" said Hermione. \"We \nknow the snake's not in Albania, it's usually with Vol\u2014\" \n\n\f\n \"Didn't I ask you to stop say that?\" \n\n \"Fine! The snake is usually with You-Know-Who\u2014happy?\" \n\n \"Not particularly.\" \n\n \"I can't see him hiding anything at Borgin and Burkes.\" said Harry, who had made \nthis point many times before, but said it again simply to break the nasty silence. \"Borgin \nand Burke were experts at Dark objects, they would've recognized a Horcrux \nstraightaway.\" \n\n Ron yawned pointedly. Repressing a strong urge to throw something at him, \nHarry plowed on, \"I still reckon he might have hidden something at Hogwarts.\" \n\n Hermione sighed. \n\n \"But Dumbledore would have found it, Harry!\" \n\n Harry repeated the argument he kept bringing out in favor of this theory. \n\n \"Dumbledore said in front of me that he never assumed he knew all of Hogwart's \nsecrets. I'm telling you, if there was one place Vol\u2014\" \n\n \"Oi!\" \n\n \"YOU-KNOW-WHO, then!\" Harry shouted, goaded past endurance. \"If there was \none place that was really important to You-Know-Who, it was Hogwarts!\" \n\n \"Oh, come on,\" scoffed Ron. \"His school?\" \n\n \"Yeah, his school! It was his first real home, the place that meant he was special: \nit meant everything to him, and even after he left\u2014\" \n\n \"This is You-Know-Who we're talking about, right? Not you?\" inquired Ron. He \nwas tugging at the chain of the Horcrux around his neck; Harry was visited by a desire to \nseize it and throttle him. \n\n \"You told us that You-Know-Who asked Dumbledore to give him a job after he \nleft,\" said Hermione. \n\n \"That's right,\" said Harry. \n\n \"And Dumbledore thought he only wanted to come back to try and find something, \nprobably another founder's object, to make into another Horcrux?\" \n\n \u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry. \n\n \u201cBut he didn\u2019t get the job, did he?\u201d said Hermione. \u201cSo he never got the chance to \nfind a founder\u2019s object there and hide it in the school!\u201d \n\n \u201cOkay, then,\u201d said Harry, defeated. \u201cForget Hogwarts.\u201d \n\n Without any other leads, they traveled into London and, hidden beneath the \nInvisibility Cloak, search for the orphanage in which Voldemort had been raised. \nHermione stole into a library and discovered from their records that the place had been \ndemolished many years before. They visited its site and found a tower block of offices. \n\n \u201cWe could try digging in to foundations?\u201d Hermione suggested halfheartedly. \n\n \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have hidden a Horcrux here,\u201d Harry said. He had known it all along. \nThe orphanage had been the place Voldemort had been determined to escape; he would \nnever have hidden a part of his soul there. Dumbledore had shown Harry that Voldemort \nsought grandeur or mystique in his hiding places; this dismal gray corner of London was \nas far removed as you could imagine from Hogwarts of the Ministry or a building like \nGringotts, the Wizarding banks, with its gilded doors and marble floors. \n\n Even without any new idea, they continued to move through the countryside, \npitching the tent in a different place each night for security. Every morning they made \nsure that they had removed all clues to their presence, then set off to find another lonely \n\n\f\nand secluded spot, traveling by Apparition to more woods, to the shadowy crevices of \ncliffs, to purple moors, gorse-covered mountainsides, and once a sheltered and pebbly \ncove. Every twelve hours or so they passed the Horcrux between them as though they \nwere playing some perverse, slow-motion game of pass-the-parcel, where they dreaded \nthe music stopping because the reward was twelve hours of increased fear and anxiety. \n\n Harry\u2019s scare kept prickling. It happened most often, he noticed, when he was \nwearing the Horcrux. Sometimes he could not stop himself reacting to the pain. \n\n \u201cWhat? What did you see?\u201d demanded Ron, whenever he noticed Harry wince. \n\n \u201cA face,\u201d muttered Harry, every time. \u201cThe same face. The thief who stole from \nGregorovitch.\u201d \n\n And Ron would turn away, making no effort to hide his disappointment. Harry \nknew that Ron was hoping to bear news of his family or the rest of the Order of the \nPhoenix, but after all, he, Harry, was not a television aerial; he could only see what \nVoldemort was thinking at the time, not tune in to whatever took his fancy. Apparently \nVoldemort was dwelling endlessly on the unknown youth with the gleeful face, whose \nname and whereabouts, Harry felt sure, Voldemort knew no better than he did. As \nHarry\u2019s scar continued to burn and the merry, blond-haired boy swam tantalizingly in his \nmemory, he learned to suppress any sign of pain or discomfort, for the other two showed \nnothing but impatience at the mention of the thief. He could not entirely blame them, \nwhen they were so desperate for a lean on the Horcruxes. \n\n As the days stretched into weeks, Harry began to suspect that Ron and Hermione \nwere having conversations without, and about, him. Several times they stopped talking \nabruptly when Harry entered the tent, and twice he came accidentally upon them, huddled \na little distance away, heads together and talking fast; both times they fell silent when \nthey realized he was approaching them and hastened to appear busy collecting wood or \nwater. \n\n Harry could not help wondering whether they had only agreed to come on what \nnow felt like a pointless and rambling journey because they thought he had some secret \nplan that they would learn in due course. Ton was making no effort to hide his bad mood, \nand Harry was starting to fear that Hermione too was disappointed by his poor leadership. \nIn desperation he tried to think of further Horcrux locations, but the only one that \ncontinued to occur to him was Hogwarts, and as neither of the others thought this at all \nlikely, he stopped suggesting it. \n\n Autumn rolled over the countryside as they moved through it. They were now \npitching the tent on mulches of fallen leaves. Natural mists joined those cast by the \ndementors; wind and rain added to their troubles. The fact that Hermione was getting \nbetter at identifying edible fungi could not altogether compensate for their continuing \nisolation, the lack of other people\u2019s company, or their total ignorance of what was going \non in the war against Voldemort. \n\n \u201cMy mother,\u201d said Ron on night, as they sat in the tent on a riverbank in Wales, \n\u201ccan make good food appear out of thin air.\u201d \n\n He prodded moodily at the lumps of charred gray fish on his plate. Harry glanced \nautomatically at Ron\u2019s neck and saw, as he has expected, the golden chain of the Horcrux \nglinting there. He managed to fight down the impulse to swear at Ron, whose attitude \nwould, he knew, improve slightly when the time came to take off the locket. \n\n\f\n \u201cYour mother can\u2019t produce food out of thin air,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cno one can. \nFood is the first of the five Principal Exceptions to Gamp\u2019s Law of Elemental \nTransfigura\u2014\u201d \n\n \u201cOh, speak English, can\u2019t you?\u201d Ron said, prising a fish out from between his \nteeth. \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to make good food out of nothing! You can Summon it if you \nknow where it is, you can transform it, you can increase the quantity if you\u2019ve already got \nsome\u2014\u201d \n\n \u201cWell, don\u2019t bother increasing this, it\u2019s disgusting,\u201d said Ron. \n\n \u201cHarry caught the fish and I did my best with it! I notice I\u2019m always the one who \nends up sorting out the food, because I\u2019m a girl, I suppose!\u201d \n\n \u201cNo, it\u2019s because you\u2019re supposed to be the best at magic!\u201d shot back Ron. \n\n Hermione jumped up and bits of roast pike slid off her tin plate onto the floor. \n\n \u201cYou can do the cooking tomorrow, Ron, you can find the ingredients and try and \ncharm them into something worth eating, and I\u2019ll sit here and pull faces and moan and \nyou can see you\u2014\u201d \n\n \u201cShut up!,\u201d said Harry, leaping to his feet and holding up both hands. \u201cShut up \nnow!\u201d \n\n Hermione looked outraged. \n\n \u201cHow can you side with him, he hardly ever does the cook\u2014\u201d \n\n \u201cHermione, be quiet, I can hear someone!\u201d \n\n He was listening hard, his hands still raised, warning them not to talk. Then, over \nthe rush and gush of the dark river beside them, he heard voices again. He looked around \nat the Sneakoscope. It was not moving. \n\n \u201cYou cast the Muffliato charm over us, right?\u201d he whispered to Hermione. \n\n \u201cI did everything,\u201d she whispered back, \u201cMuffliato, Muggle-Repelling and \nDisillusionment Charms, all of it. They shouldn\u2019t be able to hear of see us, whoever they \nare.\u201d \n\n Heavy scuffing and scraping noises, plus the sound of dislodged stones and twigs, \ntold them that several people were clambering down the steep, wooded slope that \ndescended to the narrow bank where they had pitched the tent. They drew their wands, \nwaiting. The enchantments they had cast around themselves ought to be sufficient, in the \nnear total darkness, to shield them from the notice of Muggles and normal witches and \nwizards. If these were Death Eaters, then perhaps their defenses were about to be tested \nby Dark Magic for the first time. \n\n The voices became louder but no more intelligible as the group of men reached \nthe bank. Harry estimated that their owners were fewer than twenty feet away, but the \ncascading river made it impossible to tell for sure. Hermione snatched up the beaded bag \nand started to rummage; after a moment she drew out three Extendible Ears and threw \none each to Harry and Ron, who hastily inserted the ends of the flesh-colored strings into \ntheir ears and fed the other ends out of the tent entrance. \n\n Within seconds Harry heard a weary male voice. \n\n \u201cThere ought to be a few salmon in here, or d\u2019you reckon it\u2019s too early in the \nseason? Accio Salmon!\u201d \n\n There were several distinct splashes and then the slapping sounds of fish against \nflesh. Somebody grunted appreciatively. Harry pressed the Extendable ear deeper into his \n\n\f\nown: Over the murmur of the river he could make out more voices, but they were not \nspeaking English or any human language he had ever heard. It was a rough and \nunmelodious tongue, a string of rattling, guttural noises, and there seemed to be two \nspeakers, one with a slightly lower, slower voice than the other. \n\n A fire danced into life on the other side of the canvas, large shadows passed \nbetween tent and flames. The delicious smell of baking salmon wafted tantalizingly in \ntheir direction. Then came the clinking of cutlery on plates, and the first man spoke again. \n\n \u201cHere, Griphook, Gornuk.\u201d \n\n Goblins! Hermione mouthed at Harry, who nodded. \n\n \u201cThank you,\u201d said the goblins together in English. \n\n \u201cSo, you three have been on the run how long?\u201d asked a new, mellow, and \npleasant voice; it was vaguely familiar to Harry, who pictured a round-bellied, cheerful-\nfaced man. \n\n \u201cSix weeks . . . Seven . . . I forget,\u201d said the tired man. \u201cMet up with Griphook in \nthe first couple of days and joined forces with Gornuk not long after. Nice to have a but \nof company.\u201d There was a pause, while knives scraped plates and tin mugs were picked \nup and replaced on the ground. \u201cWhat made you leave, Ted?\u201d continued the man. \n\n \u201cKnew they were coming for me,\u201d replied mellow-voiced Ted, and Harry \nsuddenly knew who he was: Tonks\u2019s father. \u201cHeard Death Eaters were in the area last \nweek and decided I\u2019d better run for it. Refused to register as a Muggle-born on principle, \nsee, so I knew it was a matter of time, knew I\u2019d have to leave in the end. My wife should \nbe okay, she\u2019s pure-blood. And then I net Dean here, what, a few days ago, son?\u201d \n\n \u201cYeah,\u201d said another voice, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione stared at each other, \nsilent but besides themselves with excitement, sure they recognized the voice of Dean \nThomas, their fellow Gryffindor. \n\n \u201cMuggle-born, eh?\u201d asked the first man. \n\n \u201cNot sure ,\u201d said Dean. \u201cMy dad left my mum when I was a kid. I\u2019ve got no proof \nhe was a wizard, though.\u201d \n\n There was silence for a while, except for the sounds of munching; then Ted spoke \nagain. \n\n \u201cI\u2019ve got to say, Dirk, I\u2019m surprised to run into you. Pleased, but surprised. Word \nwas that you\u2019d been caught.\u201d \n\n \u201cI was,\u201d said Dirk. \u201cI was halfway to Azkaban when I made a break for it. \nStunned Dawlish, and nicked his broom. It was easier than you\u2019d think; I don\u2019t reckon \nhe\u2019s quite right at the moment .Might be Confunded. If so, I\u2019d like to shake the hand of \nthe witch or wizard who did it, probably saved my life.\u201d \n\n There was another pause in which the fire crackled and the river rushed on. The \nTed said, \u201cAnd where do you two fit in? I, er, had the impression the goblins were for \nYou-Know-Who, on the whole.\u201d \n\n \u201cYou had a false impression,\u201d said the higher-voiced of the goblins. \u201cWe take no \nsides. This is a wizards\u2019 war.\u201d \n\n \u201cHow come you\u2019re in hiding, then?\u201d \n\n \u201cI deemed in prudent,\u201d said the deeper-voiced goblin. \u201cHaving refused what I \nconsidered an impertinent request, I could see that my person safety was in jeopardy.\u201d \n\n \u201cWhat did they ask you to do?\u201d asked Ted. \n\n\f\n \u201cDuties ill-befitting the dignity of my race,\u201d replied the goblin, his voice rougher \nand less human as he said it. \u201cI am not a house-elf.\u201d \n\n \u201cWhat about you, Griphook?\u201d \n\n \u201cSimilar reasons,\u201d said the higher voiced goblin. \u201cGringotts is no longer under the \nsole control of my race. I recognize no Wizarding master.\u201d \n\n He added something under his breath in Gobbledegook, and Gornuk laughed. \n\n \u201cWhat\u2019s the joke?\u201d asked Dean. \n\n \u201cHe said,\u201d replied Dirk, \u201cthat there are things wizards don\u2019t recognize, either.\u201d \n\n There was a short pause. \n\n \u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d said Dean. \n\n \u201cI had my small revenge before I left,,\u201d said Griphook in English. \n\n \u201cGood man\u2014goblin, I should say,\u201d amended Ted hastily. \u201cDidn\u2019t manage to lock \na Death Eater up in one of the old high-security vaults, I suppose?\u201d \n\n \u201cIf I had, the sword would not have helped him break out,\u201d replied Griphook. \nGornuk laughed again and even Dirk gave a dry chuckle. \n\n \u201cDean and I are still missing something here,\u201d said Ted. \n\n \u201cSo is Severus Snape, though he does not know it,\u201d said Griphook, and the two \ngoblins roared with malicious laughter. Inside the tent Harry\u2019s breathing was shallow \nwith excitement: He and Hermione stared at each other, listening as hard as they could. \n\n \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear about that, Ted?\u201d asked Dirk. \u201cAbout the kids who tried to steal \nGryffindor\u2019s sword out of Snape\u2019s office at Hogwarts?\u201d \n\n An electric current seemed to course through Harry, jangling his every nerve as he \nstood rooted to the spot. \n\n \u201cNever heard a word,\u201d said Ted, \u201cNot in the Prophet, was it?\u201d \n\n \u201cHardly,\u201d chortled Dirk. \u201cGriphook here told me, he heard about it from Bill \nWeasley who works for the bank. One of the kids who tried to take the sword was Bill\u2019s \nyounger sister.\u201d \n\n Harry glanced toward Hermione and Ron, both of whom were clutching the \nExtendable Ears as tightly as lifelines. \n\n \u201cShe and a couple of friends got into Snape\u2019s office and smashed open the glass \ncase where he was apparently keeping the sword. Snape caught them as they were trying \nto smuggle it down the staircase. \n\n \u201cAh, God bless \u2018em,\u201d said Ted. \u201cWhat did they think, that they\u2019d be able to use \nthe sword on You-Know-Who? Or on Snape himself? \n\n \u201cWell, whatever they thought they were going to do with it, Snape decided the \nsword wasn\u2019t safe where it was,\u201d said Dirk. \u201cCouple of days later, once he\u2019d got the say-\nso from You-Know-Who, I imagine, he sent it down to London to be kept in Gringotts \ninstead.\u201d \n\n The goblins started to laugh again. \n\n \u201cI\u2019m still not seeing the joke,\u201d said Ted. \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s a fake,\u201d rasped Griphook. \n\n \u201cThe sword of Gryffindor!\u201d \n\n \u201cOh yes. It is a copy\u2014en excellent copy, it is true\u2014but it was Wizard-made. The \noriginal was forged centuries ago by goblins and had certain properties only goblin-made \narmor possesses. Wherever the genuine sword of Gryffindor is, it is not in a vault at \nGringotts bank.\u201d \n\n\f\n \u201cI see,\u201d said Ted. \u201cAnd I take it you didn\u2019t bother telling the Death Eaters this/\u2019 \n\n \u201cI saw no reason to trouble them with the information,\u201d said Griphook smugly, \nand now Ted and Dean joined in Gornuk and Dirk\u2019s laughter. \n\n Inside the tent, Harry closed his eyes, willing someone to ask the question he \nneeded answered, and after a minute that seemed ten, Dean obliged: he was (Harry \nremembered with a jolt) an ex-boyfriend of Ginny\u2019s too. \n\n \u201cWhat happened to Ginny and all the others? The ones who tried to steal it?\u201d \n\n \u201cOh, they were punished, and cruelly,\u201d said Griphook indifferently. \n\n \u201cThey\u2019re okay, though?\u201d asked Ted quickly, \u201cI mean, the Weasleys don\u2019t need \nany more of their kids injured, do they?\u201d \n\n \u201cThey suffered no serious injury, as far as I am aware,\u201d said Griphook. \n\n \u201cLucky for them,\u201d said Ted. \u201cWith Snape\u2019s track record I suppose we should just \nbe glad they\u2019re still alive.\u201d \n\n \u201cYou believe that story, then, do you, Ted?\u201d asked Dirk.\u201d You believe Snape \nkilled Dumbledore? \n\n \u201cCourse I do,\u201d said Ted. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to sit there and tell me you think \nPotter had anything to do with it?\u201d \n\n \u201cHard to know what to believe these days,\u201d muttered Dirk. \n\n \u201cI know Harry Potter,\u201d said Dean. \u201cAnd I reckon he\u2019s the real thing\u2014the Chosen \nOne, or whatever you want to call it.\u201d \n\n \u201cYeah, there\u2019s a lot would like to believe he\u2019s that, son,\u201d said Dirk, \u201cme included. \nBut where is he? Run for it, by the looks of things. You\u2019d think if he knew anything we \ndon\u2019t, or had anything special going for him, he\u2019d be out there now fighting, rallying \nresistance, instead of hiding. And you know, the Prophet made a pretty good case against \nhim\u2014\u201d \n\n \u201cThe Prophet?\u201d scoffed Ted. \u201cYou deserve to be lied to if you\u2019re still reading that \nmuch, Dirk. You want the facts, try the Quibbler.\u201d \n\n There was a sudden explosion of choking and retching, plus a good deal of \nthumping, by the sound of it. Dirk had swallowed a fish bone. At last he sputtered, \u201cThe \nQuibbler? That lunatic rag of Xeno Lovegood\u2019s?\u201d \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s not so lunatic these days,\u201d said Ted. \u201cYou want to give it a look, Xeno is \nprinting all the stuff the Prophet\u2019s ignoring, not a single mention of Crumple-Horned \nSnorkacks in the last issue. How long they\u2019ll let him get with it, mind, I don\u2019t know. But \nXeno says, front page of every issue, that any wizard who\u2019s against You-Know-Who \nought to make helping Harry Potter their number-one priority.\u201d \n\n \u201cHard to help a boy who\u2019s vanished off the face of the earth,\u201d said Dirk. \n\n \u201cListen, the fact that they haven\u2019t caught him yet\u2019s one hell of an achievement,\u201d \nsaid Ted. \u201cI\u2019d take tips from him gladly; it\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do, stay free, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \n\n \u201cYeah, well, you\u2019ve got a point there,\u201d said Dirk heavily. \u201cWith the whole of the \nMinistry and all their informers looking for him, I\u2019d have expected him to be caught by \nnow. Mind, who\u2019s to say they haven\u2019t already caught and killed him without publicizing \nit?\u201d \n\n \u201cAh, don\u2019t say that, Dirk,\u201d murmured Ted. \n\n There was a long pause filled with more clattering of knives and forks. When they \nspoke again it was to discuss whether they ought to sleep on the back or retreat back up \n\n\f\nthe wooded slope. Deciding the trees would give better cover, they extinguished their fire, \nthen clambered back up the incline, their voices fading away. \n\n Harry, Ron, and Hermione reeled in the Extendable Ears. Harry, who had found \nthe need to remain silent increasingly difficult the longer they eavesdropped, now found \nhimself unable to say more then, \u201cGinny\u2014the sword\u2014\u201d \n\n \u201cI know!\u201d said Hermione. \n\n She lunged for the tiny beaded bag, this time sinking her arm in it right up to the \narmpit. \n\n \u201cHere . . . we . . . are . . .\u201d she said between gritted teeth, and she pulled at \nsomething that was evidently in the depths of the bag. Slowly the edge of an ornate \npicture frame came into sight. Harry hurried to help her. As they lifted the empty portrait \nof Phineas Nigellus free of Hermione\u2019s bag, she kept her wand pointing at it, ready to \ncast a spell at any moment. \n\n \u201cIf somebody swapped the real sword for the face while it was in Dumbledore\u2019s \noffice,\u201d she panted, as they propped the painting against the side of the tent, \u201cPhineas \nNigellus would have seen it happen, he hangs right beside the case!\u201d \n\n \u201cUnless he was asleep,\u201d said Harry, but he still held his breath as Hermione knelt \ndown in front of the empty canvas, her wand directed at its center, cleared her throat, then \nsaid: \n\n \u201cEr\u2014Phineas? Phineas Nigellus?\u201d \n\n Nothing happened. \n\n \u201cPhineas Nigellus?\u201d said Hermione again. \u201cProfessor Black? Please could we talk \nto you? Please?\u201d \n\n \u201c\u2019Please\u2019 always helps,\u201d said a cold, snide voice, and Phineas Nigellus slid into \nhis portrait. At one, Hermione cried: \n\n \u201cObscura!\u201d \n\n A black blindfold appeared over Phineas Nigellus\u2019s clever, dark eyes, causing \nhim to bump into the frame and shriek with pain. \n\n \u201cWhat\u2014how dare\u2014what are you\u2014?\u201d \n\n \u201cI\u2019m very sorry, Professor Black,\u201d said Hermione, \u201cbut it\u2019s a necessary \nprecaution!\u201d \n\n \u201cremove this foul addition at once! Remove it, I say! You are ruining a great work \nof art! Where am I? What is going on?\u201d \n\n \u201cNever mind where we are,\u201d said Harry, and Phineas Nigellus froze, abandoning \nhis attempts to peel off the painted blindfold. \n\n \u201cCan that possible be the voice of the elusive Mr. Potter?\u201d \n\n \u201cMaybe,\u201d said Harry, knowing that this would keep Phineas Nigellus\u2019s interest. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a couple of questions to ask you\u2014about the sword of Gryffindor.\u201d \n\n \u201cAh,\u201d said Phineas Nigellus, now turning his head this way and that in an effort to \ncatch sight of Harry, \u201cyes. That silly girl acted most unwisely there\u2014\u201d \n\n \u201cShut up about my sister,\u201d said Ron roughly, Phineas Nigellus raised supercilious \neyebrows. \n\n \u201cWho else is here?\u201d he asked, turning his head from side to side. \u201cYour tone \ndispleases me! The girl and her friends were foolhardily in the extreme. Thieving from \nthe headmaster.\u201d \n\n \u201cThey weren\u2019t thieving,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThat sword isn\u2019t Snape\u2019s.\u201d \n\n\f\n \u201cIt belongs to Professor Snape\u2019s school,\u201d said Phineas Nigellus. \u201cExactly what \nclaim did the Weasley girl have upon it? She deserved her punishment, as did the idiot \nLongbottom and the Lovegood oddity!\u201d \n\n \u201cNeville is not an idiot and Luna is not an oddity!\u201d said Hermione. \n\n \u201cWhere am I?\u201d repeated Phineas Nigellus, starting to wrestle with the blindfold \nagain. \u201cWhere have you brought me? Why have you removed me from the house of my \nforebears?\u201d \n\n \u201cnever mind that! How did Snape punish Ginny, Neville, and Luna?\u201d asked Harry \nurgently. \n\n \u201cProfessor Snape sent them into the Forbidden Forest, to do some work for the \noaf, Hagrid.\u201d \n\n \u201cHagrid\u2019s not an oaf!\u201d said Hermione shrilly. \n\n \u201cAnd Snape might\u2019ve though that was a punishment,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbuy Ginny, \nNeville, and Luna probably had a good laugh with Hagrid. The Forbidden Forest . . . \nthey\u2019ve faced plenty worse than the Forbidden Forest, big deal!\u201d \n\n He felt relieved; he had been imagining horrors, the Cruciatus Curse at the very \nleast. \n\n \u201cWhat we really wanted to know, Professor Black, is whether anyone else has, um, \ntaken out the sword at all? Maybe it\u2019s been taken away for cleaning\u2014or something!\u201d \n\n Phineas Nigellus paused again in his struggles to free his eyes and sniggered. \n\n \u201cMuggle-born,\u201d he said, \u201cGoblin-made armor does not require cleaning, simple \ngirl. Goblin\u2019s silver repels mundane dirt, imbibing only that which strengthens it.\u201d \n\n \u201cDon\u2019t call Hermione simple,\u201d said Harry. \n\n \u201cI grow weary of contradiction,\u201d said Phineas Nigellus. \u201cperhaps it is time for me \nto return to the headmaster\u2019s office.?\u201d \n\n Still blindfolded, he began groping the side of his frame, trying to feel his way out \nof his picture and back into the one at Hogwarts. Harry had a sudden inspiration. \n\n \u201cDumbledore! Can\u2019t you bring us Dumbledore?\u201d \n\n \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d asked Phineas Nigellus. \n\n \u201cProfessor Dumbledore\u2019s portrait\u2014couldn\u2019t you bring him along, here, into \nyours?\u201d \n\n Phineas Nigellus turned his face in the direction of Harry\u2019s voice. \n\n \u201cEvidently it is not only Muggle-borns who are ignorant, Potter. The portraits of \nHogwarts may commune with each other, but they cannot travel outside of the castle \nexcept to visit a painting of themselves elsewhere. Dumbledore cannot come here with \nme, and after the treatment I have received at your hands, I can assure you that I will not \nbe making a return visit!\u201d \n\n Slightly crestfallen, Harry watched Phineas redouble his attempts to leave his \nframe. \n\n \u201cProfessor Black,\u201d said Hermione, \u201ccouldn\u2019t you just tell us, please, when was the \nlast time the sword was taken out of its case? Before Ginny took it out, I mean?\u201d \n\n Phineas snorted impatiently. \n\n \u201cI believe that the last time I saw the sword of Gryffindor leave its case was when \nProfessor Dumbledore used it to break open a ring.\u201d \n\n Hermione whipped around to look at Harry. Neither of them dared say more in \nfront of Phineas Nigellus, who had at least managed to locate the exit. \n\n\f\n \u201cWell, good night to you,\u201d he said a little waspishly, and he began to move out of \nsight again. Only the edge of his hat brim remained in view when Harry gave a sudden \nshout. \n\n \u201cWait! Have you told Snape you saw this?\u201d \n\n Phineas Nigellus stuck his blindfolded head back into the picture. \n\n \u201cProfessor Snape has more important things on his mind that the many \neccentricities of Albus Dumbledore. Good-bye, Potter!\u201d \n\n And with that, he vanished completely, leaving behind him nothing but his murky \nbackdrop. \n\n \u201cHarry!\u201d Hermione cried. \n\n \u201cI know!\u201d Harry shouted. Unable to contain himself, he punched the air; it was \nmore than he had dared to hope for. He strode up and down the tent, feeling that he could \nhave run a mile; he did not even feel hungry anymore. Hermione was squashing Phineas \nNigellus\u2019s back into the beaded bag; when she had fastened the clasp she threw the bag \naside and raised a shining face to Harry. \n\n \u201cThe sword can destroy Horcruxes! Goblin-made blades imbibe only that which \nstrengthens them\u2014Harry, that sword\u2019s impregnated with basilisk venom!\u201d \n\n \u201cAnd Dumbledore didn\u2019t five it to me because he still needed it, he wanted to use \nit on the locket\u2014\u201d \n\n \u201c\u2014and he must have realized they wouldn\u2019t let you have it if he put it in his \nwill\u2014\u201d \n\n \u201c\u2014so he made a copy\u2014\u201d \n\n \u201c\u2014and put a fake in the glass case\u2014\u201d \n\n \u201c\u2014and he left the real one\u2014where?\u201d \n\n They gazed at east other Harry felt that the answer was dangling invisibly in the \nair above them, tantalizingly close. Why hadn\u2019t Dumbledore told him? Or had he, in fact, \ntold Harry, but Harry had not realized it at the time?\u201d \n\n \u201cThink!\u201d whispered Hermione. \u201cThink! Where would he have left it?\u201d \n\n \u201cNot at Hogwarts,\u201d said Harry, resuming his pacing. \n\n \u201cSomewhere in Hogsmeade?\u201d suggested Hermione. \n\n \u201cThe Shrieking Shack?\u201d said Harry. \u201cNobody ever goes in there.\u201d \n\n \u201cBut Snape knows how to get in, wouldn\u2019t that be a bit risky?\u201d \n\n \u201cDumbledore trusted Snape,\u201d Harry reminded her. \n\n \u201cNot enough to tell him that he had swapped the swords,\u201d said Hermione. \n\n \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right!\u201d said Harry, and he felt even more cheered at the thought \nthat Dumbledore had had some reservations, however faint, about Snape\u2019s \ntrustworthiness. \u201cSo, would he have hidden the sword well away from Hogsmeade, then? \nWhat d\u2019you reckon, Ron? Ron?\u201d \n\n Harry looked around. For one bewildered moment he thought that Ron had left \nthe tent, then realized that Ron was lying in the shadow of a bunk, looking stony. \n\n \u201cOh, remembered me, have you?\u201d he said. \n\n \u201cWhat?\u201d \n\n Ron snorted as he stared up at the underside of the upper bunk. \n\n \u201cYou two carry on. Don\u2019t let me spoil your fun.\u201d \n\n Perplexed, Harry looked to Hermione for help, but she shook her head, apparently \nas nonplussed as he was. \n\n\f\n \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d asked Harry. \n\n \u201cProblem? There\u2019s no problem,\u201d said Ron, still refusing to look at Harry. \u201cNot \naccording to you, anyways.\u201d \n\n There were several plunks on the canvas over their heads. It had started to rain. \n\n \u201cWell, you\u2019ve obviously got a problem,\u201d said Harry. \u201cSpit it out, will you?\u201d \n\n Ron swung his long legs off the bed and sat up. He looked mean, unlike himself. \n\n \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll spit it out. Don\u2019t expect me to skip up and down the tent because \nthere\u2019s some other damn thing we\u2019ve got to find. Just add it to the list of stuff you don\u2019t \nknow.\u201d \n\n \u201cI don\u2019t know?\u201d repeated Harry. \u201cI don\u2019t know?\u201d \n\n Plunk, plunk, plunk. The rain was falling harder and heavier; it pattered on the \nleaf-strewn bank all around them and into the river chattering through the dark. Dread \ndoused Harry\u2019s jubilation; Ron was saying exactly what he had suspected and feared him \nto be thinking. \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m not having the time of my life here,\u201d said Ron, \u201cyou know, with \nmy arm mangled and nothing to eat and freezing my backside off every night. I just \nhoped, you know, after we\u2019d been running round a few weeks, we\u2019d have achieved \nsomething.\u201d \n\n \u201cRon,\u201d Hermione said, but in such a quiet voice that Ron could pretend not to \nhave heard it over the loud tattoo the rain was beating on the tent. \n\n \u201cI thought you knew what you\u2019d signed up for,\u201d said Harry. \n\n \u201cYeah, I thought I did too.\u201d \n\n \u201cSo what part of it isn\u2019t living up to your expectations?\u201d asked Harry. Anger was \ncoming to his defense now. \u201cDid you think we\u2019d be staying in five-star hotels? Finding a \nHorcrux every other day? Did you think you\u2019d be back to Mummy by Christmas?\u201d \n\n \u201cWe thought you knew what you were doing!\u201d shouted Ron, standing up, and his \nwords Harry like scalding knives. \u201cWe thought Dumbledore had told you what to do, we \nthought you had a real plan!\u201d \n\n \u201cRon!\u201d said Hermione, this time clearly audible over the rain thundering on the \ntent roof, but again, he ignored her. \n\n \u201cWell, sorry to let you down,\u201d said Harry, his voice quite calm even though he \nfelt hollow, inadequate. \u201cI\u2019ve been straight with you from the start. I told you everything \nDumbledore told me. And in the case you haven\u2019t noticed, we\u2019ve found one Horcrux\u2014\u201d \n\n \u201cYeah, and we\u2019re about as near getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of \nthem\u2014nowhere effing near in other words.\u201d \n\n \u201ctake off the locket, Ron,\u201d Hermione said, her voice unusually high. \u201cPlease take \nit off. You wouldn\u2019t be talking like this if you hadn\u2019t been wearing it all day.\u201d \n\n \u201cYeah, he would,\u201d said Harry, who did not want excuses made for Ron. \u201cD\u2019you \nthink I haven\u2019t noticed the two of you whispering behind my back? D\u2019you think I didn\u2019t \nguess you were thinking this stuff? \n\n \u201cHarry, we weren\u2019t\u2014\u201d \n\n \u201cDon\u2019t lie!\u201d Ron hurled at her. \u201cYou said it too, you said you were disappointed, \nyou said you\u2019d thought he had a bit more to go on than\u2014\u201d \n\n \u201cI didn\u2019t say it like that\u2014Harry, I didn\u2019t!\u201d she cried. \n\n The rain was pounding the tent, tears were pouring down Hermione\u2019s face, and \nthe excitement of a few minutes before had vanished as if it had never been, a short-lived \n\n\f\nfirework that had flared and died, leaving everything dark, wet, and cold. The sword of \nGryffindor was hidden they knew not where, and their were three teenagers in a tent \nwhose only achievement was not, yet, to be dead. \n\n \u201cSo why are you still here?\u201d Harry asked Ron. \n\n \u201cSearch me,\u201d said Ron. \n\n \u201cGo home then,\u201d said Harry. \n\n \u201cYeah, maybe I will!\u201d shouted Ron, and he took several steps toward Harry, who \ndid not back away. \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear what they said about my sister? But you don\u2019t give a \nrat\u2019s fart, do you, it\u2019s only the Forbidden Forest, Harry I\u2019ve-Faced-Worse Potter doesn\u2019t \ncare what happened to her in there\u2014well, I do, all right, giant spiders and mental stuff\u2014\u201d \n\n \u201cI was only saying\u2014she was with the others, they were with Hagrid\u2014\u201d \n\n \u201cYeah, I get it, you don\u2019t care! And what about the rest of my family, \u2018the \nWeasleys don\u2019t need another kid injured,\u2019 did you hear that?\u201d\u001f \u201cYeah, I\u2014\u201d \n\n \u201cNot bothered what it meant, though?\u201d \n\n \u201cRon!\u201d said Hermione, forcing her way between them. \u201cI don\u2019t think it means \nanything new has happened, anything we don\u2019t know about; think, Ron, Bill\u2019s already \nscared, plenty of people must have seen that George has lost an ear by now, and you\u2019re \nsupposed to be on your deathbed with spattergroit, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s all he meant\u2014\u201d \n\n \u201cOh, you\u2019re sure, are you? Right then, well, I won\u2019t bother myself about them. \nIt\u2019s all right for you, isn\u2019t it, with your parents safely out of the way\u2014\u201d \n\n \u201cMy parents are dead!\u201d Harry bellowed. \n\n \u201cAnd mine could be going the same way!\u201d yelled Ron. \n\n \u201cThen GO!\u201d roared Harry. \u201cGo back to them, pretend you\u2019re got over your \nspattergroit and Mummy\u2019ll be able to feed you up and\u2014\u201d \n\n Ron made a sudden movement: Harry reacted, but before either wand was clear of \nits owner\u2019s pocket, Hermione had raised her own. \n\n \u201cPrestego!\u201d she cried, and an invisible shield expanded between her and Harry on \nthe one side and Ron on the other; all of them were forced backward a few steps by the \nstrength of the spell, and Harry and Ron glared from either side of the transparent barrier \nas though they were seeing each other clearly for the first time. Harry felt a corrosive \nhatred toward Ron: Something had broken between them. \n\n \u201cLeave the Horcrux,\u201d Harry said. \n\n Ron wrenched the chain from over his head and cast the locket into a nearby chair. \nHe turned to Hermione. \n\n \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d \n\n \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \n\n \u201cAre you staying, or what?\u201d \n\n \u201cI . . .\u201d She looked anguished. \u201cYes\u2014yes, I\u2019m staying. Ron, we said we\u2019d go with \nHarry, we said we\u2019d help\u2014\u201d \n\n \u201cI get it. You choose him.\u201d \n\n \u201cRon, no\u2014please\u2014come back, come back!\u201d \n\n She was impeded by her own Shield Charm; by the time she had removed it he \nhad already stormed into the night. Harry stood quite still and silent, listening to her \nsobbing and calling Ron\u2019s name amongst the trees. \n\n After a few minutes she returned, her sopping hair plastered to her face. \n\n \u201cHe\u2019s g-g-gone! Disapparated!\u201d \n\n\f\n She threw herself into a chair, curled up, and started to cry. \n\n Harry felt dazed. He stooped, picked up the Horcrux, and placed it around his \nown neck. He dragged blankets off Ron\u2019s bunk and threw them over Hermione. Then he \nclimbed onto his own bed and stared up at the dark canvas roof, listening to the pounding \nof the rain. \n\n \n\nChapter Sixteen \n\nGodric\u2019s Hollow \n\n \n\n When Harry woke the following day it was several seconds before he \nremembered what had happened. Then he hoped childishly, that it had been a dream, that \nRon was still there and had never left. Yet by turning his head on his pillow he could see \nRon's deserted bunk. It was like a dead body in the way it seems to draw his eyes. Harry \njumped down from his own bed, keeping his eyes averted from Ron's. Hermione, who \nwas already busy in the kitchen, did not wish Harry good morning, but turned \n\nher face away quickly as he went by. He's gone, Harry told himself. He's gone. He had to \nkeep thinking it as he washed and dressed as though repetition would dull the shock of it. \nHe's gone and he's not coming back. And that was the simple truth of it, Harry knew, \nbecause their protective enchantments meant that it would be impossible, once they \nvacated this spot, for Ron to find them again. He and Hermione ate breakfast in silence. \nHermione's eyes were puffy and red; she looked as if she had not slept. They packed up \ntheir things, Hermione dawdling. Harry knew why she wanted to spin out their time on \nthe riverbank; several times he saw her look up eagerly, and he was sure she had deluded \nherself into thinking that she heard footsteps through the heavy rain, but no red-haired \nfigure appeared between the trees. Every time Harry imitated her, looked around ( for he \ncould not help hoping a little, himself) and saw nothing but rain-swept woods, another \nlittle parcel of fury exploded inside him. He could hear Ron saying, \"We thought you \nknew what you were doing!\", and he resumed packing with a hard knot in the pit of his \nstomach. \n\n The muddy river beside them was rising rapidly and would soon spill over onto their \nbank. They had lingered a good hour after they would usually have departed their \ncampsite. Finally having entirely repacked the beaded bag three times, Hermione seemed \nunable to find any more reasons to delay: She and Harry gasped hands and Disapparated, \nreappearing on a windswept heather-covered hillside. The instant they arrived, Hermione \ndropped Harry's hand and walked away from him, finally sitting down on a large rock, \nher face on her knees, shaking with what he knew were sobs. He watched her, supposing \nthat he ought to go and comfort her, but something kept him rooted to the spot. \nEverything inside him felt cold and tight: Again he saw the contemptuous expression on \nRon's face. Harry strode off through the heather, walking in a large circle with the \ndistraught Hermione at its center, casting the spell she usually performed to ensure their \nprotection. \n\n They did not discuss Ron at all over the next few days. Harry was determined never to \nmention his name again and Hermione seemed to know that it was no use forcing the \nissue, although sometimes at night when she thought he was sleeping, he would hear her \n\n\f\ncrying. Meanwhile Harry had started bringing out the Marauder's map and examining it \nby wandlight. He was waiting for the moment when Ron's labeled dot would reappear in \nthe corridors of Hogwarts, proving that he had returned to the comfortable castle, \nprotected by his status of pureblood. However, Ron did not appear on the map and after a \nwhile Harry found himself taking it out simply to stare at Ginny's name in the girl's \ndormitory, wondering whether the intensity with which he gazed at it might break into \nher sleep, that she would somehow know he was thinking about her, hoping that she was \nall right. \n\n By day, hey devoted themselves to trying to determine the possible locations of \nGryffindor's sword, but the more they talked about the places in which Dumbledore \nmight have hidden it, the more desperate and far-fetched their speculation became. \nCudgel his brains though he might, Harry could not remember Dumbledore ever \nmentioning a place in which he might hide something. There were moments when he did \nnot know whether he was angrier with Ron or with Dumbledore. We thought you knew \nwhat you were doing ...We thought Dumbledore had told you what to do ... We thought \nyou had a real plan! \n\nHe could not hide it from himself: Ron had been right. Dumbledore had left him \nwith virtually nothing. They had discovered one Horcrux, but they had no means of \ndestroying it: The others were as unattainable as they had ever been. Hopelessness \nthreatened to engulf him. He was staggered now to think of his own presumption in \naccepting his friends' offers to accompany him on this meandering, pointless journey. he \nknew nothing, he had no ideas, and he was constantly, painfully on the alert for any \nindications that Hermione too was about to tell him that she had had enough. That she \nwas leaving. \n\n They were spending many evenings in near silence and Hermione took to bringing out \nPhineas Nigellus's portrait and propping it up in a chair, as though he might fill part of \nthe gaping hole left by Ron's departure. Despite his previous assertion that he would \nnever visit them again, Phineas Nigellus did not seem able to resist the chance to find out \nmore about what Harry was up to and consented to reappear, blindfolded, every few days \nof so. Harry was even glad to see him, because he was company, albeit of a snide and \ntaunting kind. They relished any news about what was happening at Hogwarts, though \nPhineas Nigellus was not an ideal informer. He venerated Snape, the first Slytherin \nheadmaster since he himself had controlled the school, and they had to be careful not to \ncriticize or ask impertinent questions about Snape, or Phineas Nigellus would instantly \nleave his painting. \n\nHowever, he did let drop certain snippets. Snape seemed to be facing a constant, \nlow level of mutiny from a hard core of students. Ginny had been banned from going into \nHogsmeade. Snape had reinstated Umbridge's old decree forbidding gatherings of three \nor more students or any unofficial student societies. From all of these things, Harry \ndeduced that Ginny, and probably Neville and Luna along with her, had been doing their \nbest to continue Dumbledore's Army. This scant news made Harry want to see Ginny so \nbadly it felt like a stomachache; but it also made him think of Ron again, and of \nDumbledore, and of Hogwarts itself, which he missed nearly as much as his ex-girlfriend. \nIndeed, as Phineas Niggellus talked about Snape's crackdown, Harry experienced a split \nsecond of madness when he imagined simply going back to school to join the \ndestabilization of Snape\u2019s regime: Being fed and having a soft bad, and other people \n\n\f\nbeing in charge, seemed the most wonderful prospect in the world at this moment. But \nthen he remembered that he was Undesirable Number One, that there was a ten-thousand \nGalleon price on his head, and that to walk into Hogwarts these days was just as \ndangerous as walking into the Ministry of Magic. Indeed, Phineas Nigellus inadvertently \nemphasized this fact my slipping in leading questions about Harry and \nHermione's whereabouts. Hermione shoved him back inside the beaded bag every time \nhe did this, and Phineas Nigellus invariably refused to reappear for several days after \nthese unceremonious good-byes. \n\nThe weather grew colder and colder. They did not dare remain in any area too \nlong, so rather than staying in the south of England, where a hard ground frost was the \nworst of their worries, they continued to meander up and down the country, braving a \nmountainside, where sleet pounded the tent; a wide, flat marsh, where the tent was \nflooded with chill water; and a tiny island in the middle of a Scottish loch, where snow \nhalf buried the tent in the night. They had already spotted Christmas Trees twinkling \nfrom several sitting room windows before there came an evening when Harry resolved to \nsuggest again, what seemed to him the only unexplored avenue left to them. They had \njust eaten an unusually good meal: Hermione had been to a supermarket under the \nInvisibility Cloak (scrupulously dropping the money into an open till as she left), and \nHarry thought that she might be more persuadable than usual on a stomach full of \nspaghetti Bolognese and tinned pears. \n\nHe had also had the foresight to suggest that they take a few hours\u2019 break from \nwearing the Horcrux, which was hanging over the end of the bunk beside him. \n\n \u201cHermione?\u201d \n\n \u201cHmm?\u201d She was curled up in one of the sagging armchairs with The Tales of \nBeedle the Bard. He could not imagine how much more she could get out of the book, \nwhich was not, after all, very long, but evidently she was still deciphering something in it, \nbecause Spellman\u2019s Syllabary lay open on the arm of the chair. \n\n Harry cleared his throat. He felt exactly as he had done on the occasion, several \nyears previously, when he had asked Professor McGonagall whether he could go into \nHogsmeade, despite the fact that he had not persuaded the Dursleys to sign his \npermission slip. \n\n \u201cHermione, I\u2019ve been thinking, and \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cHarry, could you help me with something?\u201d \nApparently she had not been listening to him. She leaned forward and held out \nThe Tales of Beedle the Bard. \n\n \u201cLook at that symbol,\u201d she said, pointing to the top of a page. Above what Harry \nassumed was the title of the story (being unable to read runes, he could not be sure), there \nwas a picture of what looked like a triangular eye, its pupil crossed with a vertical line. \n\n \u201cI never took Ancient Runes, Hermione.\u201d \n\n \u201cI know that; but it isn\u2019t a rune and it\u2019s not in the syllabary, either. All along I \nthought it was a picture of an eye, but I don\u2019t think it is! It\u2019s been inked in, look, \nsomebody\u2019s drawn it there, it isn\u2019t really part of the book. Think, have you ever seen it \nbefore?\u201d \n\u201cNo . . . No, wait a moment.\u201d Harry looked closer. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the same symbol \nLuna\u2019s dad was wearing round his neck?\u201d \n\n\f\n \u201cWell, that\u2019s what I thought too!\u201d \n\u201cThen it\u2019s Grindelwald\u2019s mark.\u201d \n\n She stared at him, openmouthed. \n\n \u201cWhat?\u201d \n\n \u201cKrum told me . . .\u201d \nHe recounted the story that Viktor Krum had told him at the wedding. Hermione \nlooked astonished. \n\n \u201cGrindelwald\u2019s mark?\u201d \n\n She looked from Harry to the weird symbol and back again. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard that \nGrindelwald had a mark. There\u2019s no mention of it in anything I\u2019ve ever read about him.\u201d \n\n \u201cWell, like I say, Krum reckoned that symbol was carved on a wall at Durmstrang, \nand Grindelwald put it there.\u201d \nShe fell back into the old armchair, frowning. \n\n \u201cThat\u2019s very odd. If it\u2019s a symbol of Dark Magic, what\u2019s it doing in a book of \nchildren\u2019s stories?\u201d \n\n \u201cYeah, it is weird,\u201d said Harry. \u201cAnd you\u2019d think Scrimgeour would have \nrecognized it. He was Minister, he ought to have been expert on Dark stuff.\u201d \n\u201cI know. . . . Perhaps he thought it was an eye, just like I did. All the other stories \nhave little pictures over the titles.\u201d \nShe did not speak, but continued to pore over the strange mark. Harry tried again. \n\n \u201cHermione?\u201d \n\n \u201cHmm?\u201d \n\n \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking. I \u2013 I want to go to Godric\u2019s Hollow.\u201d \n\n She looked up at him, but her eyes were unfocused, and he was sure she was still \nthinking about the mysterious mark on the book. \n\n \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cYes, I\u2019ve been wondering that too. I really think we\u2019ll have to.\u201d \n\n \u201cDid you hear me right?\u201d he asked. \n\n \u201cOf course I did. You want to go to Godric\u2019s Hollow. I agree. I think we should. I \nmean, I can\u2019t think of anywhere else it could be either. It\u2019ll be dangerous, but the more I \nthink about it, the more likely it seems it\u2019s there.\u201d \n\u201cEr \u2013 what\u2019s there?\u201d asked Harry. \n\n At that, she looked just as bewildered as he felt. \n\n \u201cWell, the sword, Harry! Dumbledore must have known you\u2019d want to go back \nthere, and I mean, Godric\u2019s Hollow is Godric Gryffindor\u2019s birthplace \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cReally? Gryffindor came from Godric\u2019s Hollow?\u201d \n\u201cHarry, did you ever even open A History of Magic?\u201d \n\n \u201cErm,\u201d he said, smiling for what felt like the first time in months: The muscles in \nhis face felt oddly stiff. \u201cI might\u2019ve opened it, you know, when I bought it . . . just the \nonce. . . .\u201d \n\n \u201cWell, as the village is named after him I\u2019d have thought you might have made \nthe connection,\u201d said Hermione. She sounded much more like her old self than she had \ndone of late; Harry half expected her to announce that she was off to the library. \u201cThere\u2019s \na bit about the village in A History of Magic, wait . . .\u201d \n\n She opened the beaded bag and rummaged for a while, finally extracting her copy \nof their old school textbook, A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot, which she thumbed \nthrough until finding the page she wanted. \n\n\f\n \u201c\u2019Upon the signature of the International Statute of Secrecy in 1689, wizards went \ninto hiding for good. It was natural, perhaps, that they formed their own small \ncommunities within a community. Many small villages and hamlets attracted several \nmagical families, who banded together for mutual support and protection. The villages of \nTinworsh in Cornwall, Upper Flagley in Yorkshire, and Ottery St. Catchpole on the south \ncoast of England were notable homes to knots of Wizarding families who lived alongside \ntolerant and sometimes Confunded Muggles. Most celebrated of these half-magical \ndwelling places is, perhaps, Godric\u2019s Hollow, the West Country village where the great \nwizard Godric Gryffindor was born, and where Bowman Wright, Wizarding smith, forged \nthe first Golden Snitch. The graveyard is full of the names of ancient magical families, \nand this accounts, no doubt, for the stories of hauntings that have dogged the little \nchurch beside it for many centuries.\u2019 \n\n \u201cYou and your parents aren\u2019t mentioned.\u201d Hermione said, closing the book, \n\u201cbecause Professor Bagshot doesn\u2019t cover anything later than the end of the nineteenth \ncentury. But you see? Godric\u2019s Hollow, Godric Gryffindor, Gryffindor\u2019s sword; don\u2019t \nyou think Dumbledore would have expected you to make the connection?\u201d \n\n \u201cOh yeah . . .\u201d \n\n Harry did not want to admit that he had not been thinking about the sword at all \nwhen he suggested they go to Godric\u2019s Hollow. For him, the lore of the village lay in his \nparents\u2019 graves, the house where he had narrowly escaped death, and in the person of \nBathilda Bagshot. \n\n \u201cRemember what Muriel said?\u201d he asked eventually. \n\n \u201cWho?\u201d \n\n \u201cYou know,\u201d he hesitated. He did not want to say Ron\u2019s name. \u201cGinny\u2019s great-\naunt. At the wedding. The one who said you had skinny ankles.\u201d \n\n \u201cOh,\u201d said Hermione. It was a sticky moment: Harry knew that she had sensed \nRon\u2019s name in the offing. He rushed on: \n\n \u201cShe said Bathilda Bagshot still lived in Godric\u2019s Hollow.\u201d \n\n \u201cBathilda Bagshot,\u201d murmured Hermione, running her index finger over \nBathilda\u2019s embossed name on the front cover of A History of Magic. \u201cWell, I suppose \u2013\u201c \n\n She gasped so dramatically that Harry\u2019s insides turned over; he drew his wand, \nlooking around at the entrance, half expecting to see a hand forcing its way through the \nentrance flap, but there was nothing there. \n\n \u201cWhat?\u201d he said, half angry, half relieved. \u201cWhat did you do that for? I thought \nyou\u2019d seen a Death Eater unzipping the tent, at least \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cHarry, what if Bathilda\u2019s got the sword? What if Dumbledore entrusted it to \nher?\u201d \n\n Harry considered this possibility. Bathilda would be an extremely old woman by \nnow, and according to Muriel, she was \u201cgaga.\u201d Was it likely that Dumbledore would \nhave hidden the sword of Gryffindor with her? If so, Harry felt that Dumbledore had left \na great deal to chance: Dumbledore had never revealed that he had replaced the sword \nwith a fake, nor had he so much as mentioned a friendship with Bathilda. Now, however, \nwas not the moment to cast doubt on Hermione\u2019s theory, not when she was so \nsurprisingly willing to fall in with Harry\u2019s dearest wish. \n\n \u201cYeah, he might have done! So, are we going to go to Godric\u2019s Hollow?\u201d \n\n\f\n \u201cYes, but we\u2019ll have to think it through carefully, Harry.\u201d She was sitting up now, \nand Harry could tell that the prospect of having a plan again had lifted her mood as much \nas his. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to practice Disapparating together under the Invisibility Cloak for a \nstart, and perhaps Disillusionment Charms would be sensible too, unless you think we \nshould go the whole hog and use Polyjuice Potion? In that case we\u2019ll need to collect hair \nfrom somebody. I actually think we\u2019d better do that, Harry, the thicker our disguises the \nbetter. . . .\u201d \n\n Harry let her talk, nodding and agreeing whenever there was a pause, but his mind \nhad left the conversation. For the first time since he had discovered that the sword in \nGringotts was a fake, he felt excited. \n\n He was about to go home, about to return to the place where he had had a family. \nIt was in Godric\u2019s Hollow that, but for Voldemort, he would have grown up and spent \nevery school holiday. He could have invited friends to his house. . . . He might even have \nhad brothers and sisters. . . . It would have been his mother who had made his \nseventeenth birthday cake. The life he had lost had hardly ever seemed so real to him as \nat this moment, when he knew he was about to see the place where it had been taken \nfrom him. After Hermione had gone to bed that night, Harry quietly extracted his \nrucksack from Hermione\u2019s beaded bag, and from inside it, the photograph album Hagrid \nhad given him so long ago. For the first time in months, he perused the old pictures of his \nparents, smiling and waving up at him from the images, which were all he had left of \nthem now. \n\n Harry would gladly have set out for Godric\u2019s Hollow the following day, but \nHermione had other ideas. Convinced as she was that Voldemort would expect Harry to \nreturn to the scene of his parents\u2019 deaths, she was determined that they would set off only \nafter they had ensured that they had the best disguises possible. It was therefore a full \nweek later \u2013 once they had surreptitiously obtained hairs from innocent Muggles who \nwere Christmas shopping, and had practiced Apparating and Disapparating while \nunderneath the Invisibility Cloak together \u2013 that Hermione agreed to make the journey. \n\n They were to Apparate to the village under cover of darkness, so it was late \nafternoon when they finally swallowed Polyjuice Potion, Harry transforming into a \nbalding, middle-aged Muggle man, Hermione into his small and rather mousy wife. The \nbeaded bag containing all of their possessions (apart from the Horcrux, which Harry was \nwearing around his neck) was tucked into an inside pocket of Hermione\u2019s buttoned-up \ncoat. Harry lowered the Invisibility Cloak over them, then they turned into the \nsuffocating darkness once again. \n\n Heart beating in his throat, Harry opened his eyes. They were standing hand in \nhand in a snowy lane under a dark blue sky, in which the night\u2019s first stars were already \nglimmering feebly. Cottages stood on either side of the narrow road, Christmas \ndecorations twinkling in their windows. A short way ahead of them, a glow of golden \nstreetlights indicated the center of the village. \n\n \u201cAll this snow!\u201d Hermione whispered beneath the cloak. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t we think of \nsnow? After all our precautions, we\u2019ll leave prints! We\u2019ll just have to get rid of them \u2013 \nyou go in front, I\u2019ll do it \u2013\u201c \n\n Harry did not want to enter the village like a pantomime horse, trying to keep \nthemselves concealed while magically covering their traces. \n\n\f\n \u201cLet\u2019s take off the Cloak,\u201d said Harry, and when she looked frightened, \u201cOh, \ncome on, we don\u2019t look like us and there\u2019s no one around.\u201d \n\n He stowed the Cloak under his jacket and they made their way forward \nunhampered, the icy air stinging their faces as they passed more cottages. Any one of \nthem might have been the one in which James and Lily had once lived or where Bathilda \nlived now. Harry gazed at the front doors, their snow-burdened roofs, and their front \nporches, wondering whether he remembered any of them, knowing deep inside that it was \nimpossible, that he had been little more than a year old when he had left this place forever. \nHe was not even sure whether he would be able to see the cottage at all; he did not know \nwhat happened when the subjects of a Fidelius Charm died. Then the little lane along \nwhich they were walking curved to the left and the heart of the village, a small square, \nwas revealed to them. \n\n Strung all around with colored lights, there was what looked like a war memorial \nin the middle, partly obscured by a windblown Christmas tree. There were several shops, \na post office, a pub, and a little church whose stained-glass windows were glowing jewel-\nbright across the square. \n\n The snow here had become impacted: It was hard and slippery where people had \ntrodden on it all day. Villagers were crisscrossing in front of them, their figures briefly \nilluminated by streetlamps. They heard a snatch of laughter and pop music as the pub \ndoor opened and closed; then they heard a carol start up inside the little church. \n\n \u201cHarry, I think it\u2019s Christmas Eve!\u201d said Hermione. \n\n \u201cIs it?\u201d \n\n He had lost track of the date; they had not seen a newspaper for weeks. \n\n \u201cI\u2019m sure it is,\u201d said Hermione, her eyes upon the church. \u201cThey . . . they\u2019ll be in \nthere, won\u2019t they? Your mum and dad? I can see the graveyard behind it.\u201d \n\n Harry felt a thrill of something that was beyond excitement, more like fear. Now \nthat he was so near, he wondered whether he wanted to see after all. Perhaps Hermione \nknew how he was feeling, because she reached for his hand and took the lead for the first \ntime, pulling him forward. Halfway across the square, however, she stopped dead. \n\n \u201cHarry, look!\u201d \n\n She was pointing at the war memorial. As they had passed it, it had transformed. \nInstead of an obelisk covered in names, there was a statue of three people: a man with \nuntidy hair and glasses, a woman with long hair and a kind, pretty face, and a baby boy \nsitting in his mother\u2019s arms. Snow lay upon all their heads, like fluffy white caps. \n\n Harry drew closer, gazing up into his parents\u2019 faces. He had never imagined that \nthere would be a statue. . . . How strange it was to see himself represented in stone, a \nhappy baby without a scar on his forehead. . . . \n\n \u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d said Harry, when he had looked his fill, and they turned again toward \nthe church. As they crossed the road, he glanced over his shoulder; the statue had turned \nback into the war memorial. \n\n The singing grew louder as they approached the church. It made Harry\u2019s throat \nconstrict, it reminded him so forcefully of Hogwarts, of Peeves bellowing rude versions \nof carols from inside suits of armor, of the Great Hall\u2019s twelve Christmas trees, of \nDumbledore wearing a bonnet he had won in a cracker, of Ron in a hand-knitted \nsweater. . . . \n\n\f\n There was a kissing gate at the entrance to the graveyard. Hermione pushed it \nopen as quietly as possible and they edged through it. On either side of the slippery path \nto the church doors, the snow lay deep and untouched. They moved off through the snow, \ncarving deep trenches behind them as they walked around the building, keeping to the \nshadows beneath the brilliant windows. \n\n Behind the church, row upon row of snowy tombstones protruded from a blanket \nof pale blue that was flecked with dazzling red, gold, and green wherever the reflections \nfrom the stained glass hit the snow. Keeping his hand closed tightly on the wand in his \njacket pocket, Harry moved toward the nearest grave. \n\n \u201cLook at this, it\u2019s an Abbott, could be some long-lost relation of Hannah\u2019s!\u201d \n\n \u201cKeep your voice down,\u201d Hermione begged him. \n\n They waded deeper and deeper into the graveyard, gouging dark tracks into the \nsnow behind them, stooping to peer at the words on old headstones, every now and then \nsquinting into the surrounding darkness to make absolutely sure that they were \nunaccompanied. \n\n \u201cHarry, here!\u201d \n\n Hermione was two rows of tombstones away; he had to wade back to her, his \nheart positively banging in his chest. \n\n \u201cIs it \u2013 ?\u201d \n\n \u201cNo, but look!\u201d \n\n She pointed to the dark stone. Harry stooped down and saw , upon the frozen, \nlichen-spotted granite, the words Kendra Dumbledore and, a short way down her dates of \nbirth and death, and Her Daughter Ariana. There was also a quotation: \n\n \n\n Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. \n\n \n\n So Rita Skeeter and Muriel had got some of their facts right. The Dumbledore \nfamily had indeed lived here, and part of it had died here. \n\n Seeing the grave was worse than hearing about it. Harry could not help thinking \nthat he and Dumbledore both had deep roots in this graveyard, and that Dumbledore \nought to have told him so, yet he had never thought to share the connection. They could \nhave visited the place together; for a moment Harry imagined coming here with \nDumbledore, of what a bond that would have been, of how much it would have meant to \nhim. But it seemed that to Dumbledore, the fact that their families lay side by side in the \nsame graveyard had been an unimportant coincidence, irrelevant, perhaps, to the job he \nwanted Harry to do. \n\n Hermione was looking at Harry, and he was glad that his face was hidden in \nshadow. He read the words on the tombstone again. Where your treasure is, there will \nyour heart be also. He did not understand what these words meant. Surely Dumbledore \nhad chosen them, as the eldest member of the family once his mother had died. \n\n \u201cAre you sure he never mentioned \u2013 ?\u201d Hermione began. \n\n \u201cNo,\u201d said Harry curtly, then, \u201clet\u2019s keep looking,\u201d and he turned away, wishing \nhe had not seen the stone: He did not want his excited trepidation tainted with resentment. \n\n \u201cHere!\u201d cried Hermione again a few moments later from out of the darkness. \u201cOh \nno, sorry! I thought it said Potter.\u201d \n\n\f\n She was rubbing at a crumbling, mossy stone, gazing down at it, a little frown on \nher face. \n\n \u201cHarry, come back a moment.\u201d \n\n He did not want to be sidetracked again, and only grudgingly made his way back \nthrough the snow toward her. \n\n \u201cWhat?\u201d \n\n \u201cLook at this!\u201d \nThe grave was extremely old, weathered so that Harry could hardly make out the \nname. Hermione showed him the symbol beneath it. \n\n \u201cHarry, that\u2019s the mark in the book!\u201d \n\n He peered at the place she indicated: The stone was so worn that it was hard to \nmake out what was engraved there, though there did seem to be a triangular mark beneath \nthe nearly illegible name. \n\n \u201cYeah . . . it could be. . . .\u201d \n\n Hermione lit her wand and pointed it at the name on the headstone. \n\n \u201cIt says Ig \u2013 Ignotus, I think. . . .\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m going to keep looking for my parents, all right?\u201d Harry told her, a slight edge \nto his voice, and he set off again, leaving her crouched beside the old grave. \n\n Every now and then he recognized a surname that, like Abbott, he had met at \nHogwarts. Sometimes there were several generations of the same Wizarding family \nrepresented in the graveyard: Harry could tell from the dates that it had either died out, or \nthe current members had moved away from Godric\u2019s Hollow. Deeper and deeper \namongst the graves he went, and every time he reached a new headstone he felt a little \nlurch of apprehension and anticipation. \n\n The darkness and the silence seemed to become, all of a sudden, much deeper. \nHarry looked around, worried, thinking of dementors, then realized that the carols had \nfinished, that the chatter and flurry of churchgoers were fading away as they made their \nway back into the square. Somebody inside the church had just turned off the lights. \n\n Then Hermione\u2019s voice came out of the blackness for the third time, sharp and \nclear from a few yards away. \n\n \u201cHarry, they\u2019re here . . . right here.\u201d \n\n And he knew by her tone that it was his mother and father this time: He moved \ntoward her, feeling as if something heavy were pressing on his chest, the same sensation \nhe had had right after Dumbledore had died, a grief that had actually weighed on his heart \nand lungs. \n\n The headstone was only two rows behind Kendra and Ariana\u2019s. It was made of \nwhite marble, just like Dumbledore\u2019s tomb, and this made it easy to read, as it seemed to \nshine in the dark. Harry did not need to kneel or even approach very close to it to make \nout the words engraved upon it. \n\n \n\n JAMES POTTER LILY POTTER \n\n \n\n BORN 27 MARCH 1960 BORN 30 JANUARY 1960 \n\n DIED 31 OCTOBER 1981 DIED 31 OCTOBER 1981 \n\n \n\n The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. \n\n \n\n\f\n Harry read the words slowly, as though he would have only one chance to take in \ntheir meaning, and he read the last of them aloud. \n\n \u201c\u2019The last enemy that shall be defeated is death\u2019 . . .\u201d A horrible thought came to \nhim, and with a kind of panic. \u201cIsn\u2019t that a Death Eater idea? Why is that there?\u201d \n\n \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean defeating death in the way the Death Eaters mean it, Harry,\u201d said \nHermione, her voice gentle. \u201cIt means . . . you know . . . living beyond death. Living after \ndeath.\u201d \n\n But they were not living, thought Harry. They were gone. The empty words could \nnot disguise the fact that his parents\u2019 moldering remains lay beneath snow and stone, \nindifferent, unknowing. And tears came before he could stop them, boiling hot then \ninstantly freezing on his face, and what was the point in wiping them off or pretending? \nHe let them fall, his lips pressed hard together, looking down at the thick snow hiding \nfrom his eyes the place where the last of Lily and James lay, bones now, surely, or dust, \nnot knowing or caring that their living son stood so near, his heart still beating, alive \nbecause of their sacrifice and close to wishing, at this moment, that he was sleeping under \nthe snow with them. \n\n Hermione had taken his hand again and was gripping it tightly. He could not look \nat her, but returned the pressure, now taking deep, sharp gulps of the night air, trying to \nsteady himself, trying to regain control. He should have brought something o give them, \nand he had not thought of it, and every plant in the graveyard was leafless and frozen. But \nHermione raised her wand, moved it in a circle through the air, and a wreath of Christmas \nroses blossomed before them. Harry caught it and laid it on his parents\u2019 grave. \n\n As soon as he stood up he wanted to leave: He did not think he could stand \nanother moment there. He put his arm around Hermione\u2019s shoulders, and she put hers \naround his waist, and they turned in silence and walked away through the snow, past \nDumbledore\u2019s mother and sister, back toward the dark church and the out-of-sight kissing \ngate. \n\n \n\nChapter Seventeen \n\nBathilda\u2019s Secret \n\n \n\n\"Harry, stop.\" \n\"What's wrong?\" \nThey had only just reached the grave of the unknown Abbott. \n\"There's someone there. Someone watching us. I can tell. There, over by the bushes.\" \nThey stood quite still, holding on to each other, gazing at the dense black boundary of the \ngraveyard. Harry could not see anything. \n\"Are you sure?\" \n\n\n\f\n\"I saw something move. I could have sworn I did...\" \nShe broke from him to free her wand arm. \n\"We look like Muggles,\" Harry pointed out. \n\"Muggles who've just been laying flowers on your parents' grave? Harry, I'm sure there's \nsomeone over there!\" \nHarry thought of A History of Magic; the graveyard was supposed to be haunted; what if \n--? But then he heard a rustle and saw a little eddy of dislodged snow in the bush to \nwhich Hermione had pointed. Ghosts could not move snow. \n\"It's a cat,\" said Harry, after a second or two, \"or a bird. If it was a Death Eater we'd be \ndead by now. But let's get out of here, and we can put the Cloak back on.\" \nThey glanced back repeatedly as they made their way out of the graveyard. Harry, who \ndid not feel as sanguine as he had pretended when reassuring Hermione, was glad to \nreach the gate and the slippery pavement. They pulled the Invisibility Cloak back over \nthemselves. The pub was fuller than before. Many voices inside it were now singing the \ncarol that they had heard as they approached the church. For a moment, Harry considered \nsuggesting they take refuge inside it, but before he could say anything Hermione \nmurmured, \"Let's go this way,\" and pulled him down the dark street leading out of the \nvillage in the opposite direction from which they had entered. Harry could make out the \npoint where the cottages ended and the lane turned into open country again. They walked \nas quickly as they dared, past more windows sparkling with multicolored lights, the \noutlines of Christmas trees dark through the curtains. \n\"How are we going to find Bathilda's house?\" asked Hermione, who was shivering a little \nand kept glancing back over her shoulder. \"Harry? What do you think? Harry?\" \nShe tugged at this arm, but Harry was not paying attention. He was looking toward the \ndark mass that stood at the very end of this row of houses. Next moment he sped up, \ndragging Hermione along with him, she slipped a little on the ice. \n\"Harry --\" \n\"Look ... Look at it, Hermione ...\" \n\"I don't ... oh!\" \nHe could see it; the Fidelius Charm must have died with James and Lily. The hedge had \ngrown wild in the sixteen years since Hagrid had taken Harry from the rubble that lay \nscattered amongst the waist-high grass. Most of the cottage was still standing, though \nentirely covered in the dark ivy and snow, but the right side of the top floor had been \nblown apart; that, Harry was sure, was where the curse had backfired. He and Hermione \n\n\f\nstood at the gate, gazing up at the wreck of what must once have been a cottage just like \nthose that flanked it. \n\"I wonder why nobody's ever rebuilt it?\" whispered Hermione. \n\"Maybe you can't rebuild it?\" Harry replied. \"Maybe it's like the injuries from Dark \nMagic and you can't repair the damage?\" \nHe slipped a hand from beneath the Cloak and grasped the snowy and thickly rusted gate, \nnot wishing to open it, but simply so he'd some part of the house. \n\"You're not going to go inside? It looks unsafe, it might -- oh, Harry, look!\" \nHis touch on the gate seemed to have done it. A sign had risen out of the ground in front \nof them, up thorough the tangles of nettles and weeds, like some bizarre, fast-growing \nflower, and in golden letters upon the wood it said: \nOn this spot, on this night of 31 October 1981, \nLily and James Potter lost their lives. \nTheir son, Harry, remains the only wizard \never to have survived the Killing Curse. \nThis house, invisible to Muggles, has been left \nin its ruined state as a monument to the Potters \nand as a reminder of the violence \nthat tore apart their family. \nAnd all around these neatly lettered words, scribbles had been added by other witches \nand wizards who had come to see the place where the Boy Who Lived had escaped. \nSome had merely signed their names in Everlasting Ink; others had carved their initials \ninto the wood, still others had left messages. The most recent of these, shining brightly \nover sixteen years' worth of magical graffiti, all said similar things. \nGood luck, Harry, wherever you are. \nIf you read this, Harry, we're all behind you! \nLong live Harry Potter. \n\"They shouldn't have written on the sign!\" said Hermione, indignant. \nBut Harry beamed at her. \n\"It's brilliant. I'm glad they did. I ...\" \nHe broke off. A heavily muffled figure was hobbling up the lane toward them, silhouetted \nby the bright lights in the distant square. Harry thought, though it was hard to judge, that \nthe figure was a woman. She was moving slowly, possibly frightened of slipping on the \nsnowy ground. Her stoop, her stoutness, her shuffling gait all gave an impression of \n\n\f\nextreme age. They watched in silence as she drew nearer. Harry was waiting to see \nwhether she would turn into any of the cottages she was passing, but he knew \ninstinctively that she would not. At last she came to a halt a few yards from them and \nsimply stood there in the middle of the frozen road, facing them. \nHe did not need Hermione's pinch to his arm. There was next to no chance that this \nwoman was a Muggle: She was standing there gazing at a house that ought to have been \ncompletely invisible to her, if she was not a witch. Even assuming that she was a witch, \nhowever, it was odd behavior to come out on a night this cold, simply to look at an old \nruin. By all the rules of normal magic, meanwhile, she ought not to be able to see \nHermione and him at all. Nevertheless, Harry had the strangest feeling that she knew that \nthey were there, and also who they were. Just as he had reached this uneasy conclusion, \nshe raised a gloved hand and beckoned. \nHermione moved closer to him under the Cloak, her arm pressed against his. \n\"How does she know?\" \nHe shook his head. The woman beckoned again, more vigorously. Harry could think of \nmany reasons not to obey the summons, and yet his suspicions about her identity were \ngrowing stronger every moment that they stood facing each other in the deserted street. \nWas it possible that she had been waiting for them all these long months? That \nDumbledore had told her to wait, and that Harry would come in the end? Was it not likely \nthat it was she who had moved in the shadows in the graveyard and had followed them to \nthis spot? Even her ability to sense them suggested some Dumbledore-ish power that he \nhad never encountered before. \nFinally Harry spoke, causing Hermione to gasp and jump. \n\"Are you Bathilda?\" \nThe muffled figure nodded and beckoned again. \nBeneath the Cloak Harry and Hermione looked at each other. Harry raised his eyebrows; \nHermione gave a tiny, nervous nod. \nThey stepped toward the woman and , at once, she turned and hobbled off back the way \nthey had come. Leading them past several houses, she turned in at a gate. They followed \nher up the front path through a garden nearly as overgrown as the one they had just left. \nShe fumbled for a moment with a key at the front door, then opened it and stepped back \nto let them pass. \nShe smelled bad, or perhaps it was her house; Harry wrinkled his nose as they sidled past \nher and pulled off the Cloak. Now that he was beside her, he realized how tiny she was; \nbowed down with age, she came barely level with his chest. She closed the door behind \n\n\f\nthem, her knuckles blue and mottled against the peeling paint, then turned and peered into \nHarry's face. Her eyes were thick with cataracts and sunken into folds of transparent skin, \nand her whole face was dotted with broken veins and liver spots. He wondered whether \nshe could make him out at all; even if she could, it was the balding Muggle whose \nidentity he had stolen that she would see. \nThe odor of old age, of dust, of unwashed clothes and stale food intensified as the \nunwound a moth-eaten black shawl, revealing a head of scant white hair through which \nthe scalp showed clearly. \n\"Bathilda?\" Harry repeated. \nShe nodded again. Harry became aware of the locket against his skin; the thing inside it \nthat sometimes ticked or beat had woken; he could feel it pulsing through the cold gold. \nDid it know, could it sense, that the thing that would destroy it was near? \nBathilda shuffled past them, pushing Hermione aside as though she had not seen her, and \nvanished into what seemed to be a sitting room. \n\"Harry, I'm not sure about this,\" breathed Hermione. \n\"Look at the size of her, I think we could overpower her if we had to,\" said Harry. \"Listen, \nI should have told you, I knew she wasn't all there. Muriel called her 'gaga.'\" \n\"Come!\" called Bathilda from the next room. \nHermione jumped and clutched Harry's arm. \n\"It's okay,\" said Harry reassuringly, and he led the way into the sitting room. \nBathilda was tottering around the place lighting candles, but it was still very dark, not to \nmention extremely dirty. Thick dust crunched beneath their feet, and Harry's nose \ndetected, underneath the dank and mildewed smell, something worse, like meat gone bad. \nHe wondered when was the last time anyone had been inside Bathilda's house to check \nwhether she was coping. She seemed to have forgotten that she could do magic, too, for \nshe lit the candles clumsily by hand, her trailing lace cuff in constant danger of catching \nfire. \n\"Let me do that,\" offered Harry, and he took the matches from her. She stood watching \nhim as he finished lighting the candle stubs that stood on saucers around the room, \nperched precariously on stacks of books and on side tables crammed with cracked and \nmoldy cups. \nThe last surface on which Harry spotted a candle was a bow-fronted chest of drawers on \nwhich there stood a large number of photographs. When the flame danced into life, its \nreflection wavered on their dusty glass and silver. He saw a few tiny movements from the \n\n\f\npictures. As Bathilda fumbled with logs for the fire, he muttered \"Tergeo\": The dust \nvanished from the photographs, and he saw at once that half a dozen were missing from \nthe largest and most ornate frames. He wondered whether Bathilda or somebody else had \nremoved them. Then the sight of a photograph near the back of the collection caught his \neye, and he snatched it up. \nIt was the golden-haired, merry-faced thief, the young man who had perched on \nGregorovitch's windowsill, smiling lazily up at Harry out of the silver frame. And it came \nto Harry instantly where he had seen the boy before: in The Life and Lies of Albus \nDumbledore, arm in arm with the teenage Dumbledore, and that must be where all the \nmissing photographs were: in Rita's book. \n\"Mrs. -- Miss -- Bagshot?\" he said, and his voice shook slightly. \"Who is this?\" \nBathilda was standing in the middle of the room watching Hermione light the fire for her. \n\"Miss Bagshot?\" Harry repeated, and he advanced with the picture in his hands as the \nflames burst into life in the fireplace. Bathilda looked up at his voice, and the Horcrux \nbeat faster upon his chest. \n\"Who is this person?\" Harry asked her, pushing the picture forward. \nShe peered at it solemnly, then up at Harry. \n\"Do you know who this is?\" he repeated in a much slower and louder voice than usual. \n\"This man? Do you know him? What's he called?\" \nBathilda merely looked vague. Harry felt an awful frustration. How had Rita Skeeter \nunlocked Bathilda's memories? \n\"Who is this man?\" he repeated loudly. \n\"Harry, what area you doing?\" asked Hermione. \n\"This picture. Hermione, it's the thief, the thief who stole from Gregorovitch! Please!\" he \nsaid to Bathilda. \"Who is this?\" \nBut she only stared at him. \n\"Why did you ask us to come with you, Mrs. - Miss -- Bagshot?\" asked Hermione, \nraising her own voice. \"Was there something you wanted to tell us?\" \nGiving no sign that she had heard Hermione, Bathilda now shuffled a few steps closer to \nHarry. With a little jerk of her head she looked back into the hall. \n\"You want us to leave?\" he asked. \n\n\f\n She repeated the gesture, this time pointing firstly at him, then at herself, then at the \nceiling. \n\"Oh, right... Hermione, I think she wants me to go upstairs with her.\" \n\"All right,\" said Hermione, \"let's go.\" \nBut when Hermione moved, Bathilda shook her head with surprising vigor, once more \npointing first at Harry, then to herself. \n\"She wants me to go with her, alone.\" \n\"Why?\" asked Hermione, and her voice rang out sharp and clear in the candlelit room, the \nold lady shook her head a little at the loud noise. \n\"Maybe Dumbledore told her to give the sword to me, and only to me?\" \n\"Do you really think she knows who you are?\" \n\"Yes,\" said Harry, looking down into the milky eyes fixed upon his own. \"I think she \ndoes.\" \n\"Well, okay then, but be quick, Harry.\" \n\"Lead the way,\" Harry told Bathilda. \nShe seemed to understand, because she shuffled around him toward the door. Harry \nglanced back at Hermione with a reassuring smile, but he was not sure she had seen it; \nshe stood hugging herself in the midst of the candlelit squalor, looking toward the \nbookcase. As Harry walked out of the room, unseen by both Hermione and Bathilda, he \nslipped the silver-framed photograph of the unknown thief inside his jacket. \nThe stairs were steep and narrow; Harry was half tempted to place his hands on stout \nBathilda's backside to ensure that she did not topple over backward on top of him, which \nseemed only too likely. Slowly, wheezing a little, she climbed to the upper landing, \nturned immediately right, and led him into a low-ceilinged bedroom. \nIt was pitch-black and smelled horrible: Harry had just made out a chamber pot \nprotruding from under the bed before Bathilda closed the door and even that was \nswallowed by the darkness. \n\"Lumos,\" said Harry, and his wand ignited. He gave a start: Bathilda had moved close to \nhim in those few seconds of darkness, and he had not heard her approach. \n\"You are Potter?\" she whispered. \n\n\f\n \"Yes, I am.\" \nShe nodded slowly, solemnly. Harry felt the Horcrux beating fast, faster than his own \nheart; It was an unpleasant, agitating sensation. \n\"Have you got anything for me?\" Harry asked, but she seemed distracted by his lit wand-\ntip. \n\"Have you got anything for me?\" he repeated. \nThen she closed her eyes and several things happened at once: Harry's scar prickled \npainfully; the Horcrux twitched so that the front of his sweater actually moved; the dark, \nfetid room dissolved momentarily. He felt a leap of joy and spoke in a high, cold voice: \nHold him! \nHarry swayed where he stood: The dark, foul-smelling room seemed to close around him \nagain; he did not know what had just happened. \n\"Have you got anything for me?\" he asked for a third time, much louder. \n\"Over here,\" she whispered, pointing to the corner. Harry raised his wand and saw the \noutline of a cluttered dressing table beneath the curtained window. \nThis time she did not lead him. Harry edged between her and the unmade bed, his wand \nraised. He did not want to look away from her. \n\"What is it?\" he asked as he reached the dressing table, which was heaped high with what \nlooked and smelled like dirty laundry. \n\"There,\" she said, pointing at the shapeless mass. \nAnd in the instant that he looked away, his eyes taking the tangled mess for a sword hilt, \na ruby, she moved weirdly: He saw it out of the corner of his eye; panic made him turn \nand horror paralyzed him as he saw the old body collapsing and the great snake pouring \nfrom the place where her neck had been. \nThe snake struck as he raised his wand: The force of the bite to his forearm sent the wand \nspinning up toward the ceiling; its light swung dizzyingly around the room and was \nextinguished; Then a powerful blow from the tail to his midriff knocked the breath out of \nhim: He fell backward onto the dressing table, into the mound of filthy clothing -- \nHe rolled sideways, narrowly avoiding the snake's tail, which thrashed down upon the \ntable where he had been a second earlier. Fragments of the glass surface rained upon him \nas he hit the floor. From below he heard Hermione call, \"Harry?\" \n\n\n\f\nHe could not get enough breath into his lungs to call back: Then a heavy smooth mass \nsmashed him to the floor and he felt it slide over him, powerful, muscular -- \n\"No!\" he gasped, pinned to the floor. \n\"Yes,\" whispered the voice. \"Yesss... hold you ... hold you ...\" \n\"Accio ... Accio Wand ...\" \nBut nothing happened and he needed his hands to try to force the snake from him as it \ncoiled itself around his torso, squeezing the air from him, pressing the Horcrux hard into \nhis chest, a circle of ice that throbbed with life, inches from his own frantic heart, and his \nbrain was flooding with cold, white light, all thought obliterated, his own breath drowned, \ndistant footsteps, everything going... \nA metal heart was banging outside his chest, and now he was flying, flying with triumph \nin his heart, without need of broomstick or thestral... \nHe was abruptly awake in the sour-smelling darkness; Nagini had released him. He \nscrambled up and saw the snake outlined against the landing light: It struck, and \nHermione dived aside with a shriek; her deflected curse hit the curtained window, which \nshattered. Frozen air filled the room as Harry ducked to avoid another shower of broken \nglass and his foot slipped on a pencil-like something -- his wand -- \nHe bent and snatched it up, but now the room was full of the snake, its tail thrashing; \nHermione was nowhere to be seen and for a moment Harry thought the worst, but then \nthere was a loud bang and a flash of red light, and the snake flew into the air, smacking \nHarry hard in the face as it went, coil after heavy coil rising up to the ceiling. Harry \nraised his wand, but as he did so, his scar seared more painfully, more powerfully than it \nhad done in years. \n\"He's coming! Hermione, he's coming!\" \nAs he yelled the snake fell, hissing wildly. Everything was chaos: It smashed shelves \nfrom the wall, and splintered china flew everywhere as Harry jumped over the bed and \nseized the dark shape he knew to be Hermione -- \nShe shrieked with pain as he pulled her back across the bed: The snake reared again, but \nHarry knew that worse than the snake was coming, was perhaps already at the gate, his \nhead was going to split open with the pain from his scar -- \nThe snake lunged as he took a running leap, dragging Hermione with him; as it struck, \nHermione screamed, \"Confringo!\" and her spell flew around the room, exploding the \nwardrobe mirror and ricocheting back at them, bouncing from floor to ceiling; Harry felt \nthe heat of it sear the back of his hand. Glass cut his cheek as, pulling Hermione with him, \nhe leapt from bed to broken dressing table and then straight out of the smashed window \n\n\f\ninto nothingness, her scream reverberating through the night as they twisted in midair ... \nAnd then his scar burst open and he was Voldemort and he was running across the fetid \nbedroom, his long white hands clutching at the windowsill as he glimpsed the bald man \nand the little woman twist and vanish, and he screamed with rage, a scream that mingled \nwith the girl's, that echoed across the dark gardens over the church bells ringing in \nChristmas Day... \nAnd his scream was Harry's scream, his pain was Harry's pain... that it could happen here, \nwhere it had happened before... here, within sight of that house where he had come so \nclose to knowing what it was to die ... to die ... the pain was so terrible ... ripped from his \nbody ... But if he had no body, why did his head hurt so badly; if he was dead, how cold \nhe feel so unbearably, didn't pain cease with death, didn't it go ... \nThe night wet and windy, two children dressed as pumpkins waddling across the square \nand the shop windows covered in paper spiders, all the tawdry Muggle trappings of a \nworld in which they did not believe ... And he was gliding along, that sense of purpose \nand power and rightness in him that he always knew on these occasions ... Not anger ... \nthat was for weaker souls than he ... but triumph, yes ... He had waited for this, he had \nhoped for it ... \n\"Nice costume, mister!\" \nHe saw the small boy's smile falter as he ran near enough to see beneath the hood of the \ncloak, saw the fear cloud his pained face: Then the child turned and ran away ... Beneath \nthe robe he fingered the handle of his wand ... One simple movement and the child would \nnever reach his mother ... but unnecessary, quite unnecessary ... \nAnd along a new and darker street he moved, and now his destination was in sight at last, \nthe Fidelius Charm broken, though they did not know it yet ... And he made less noise \nthan the dead leaves slithering along the pavement as he drew level with the dark hedge, \nand steered over it ... \nThey had not drawn the curtains; he saw them quite clearly in their little sitting room, the \ntall black-haired man in his glasses, making puffs of colored smoke erupt from his wand \nfor the amusement of the small black-haired boy in his blue pajamas. The child was \nlaughing and trying to catch the smoke, to grab it in his small fist ... \nA door opened and the mother entered, saying words he cold not hear, her long dark-red \nhair falling over her face. Now the father scooped up the son and handed him to the \nmother. He threw his wand down upon the sofa and stretched, yawning... \nThe gate creaked a little as he pushed it open, but James Potter did not hear. His white \nhand pulled out the wand beneath his cloak and pointed it at the door, which burst open... \nHe was over the threshold as James came sprinting into the hall. It was easy, too easy, he \n\n\f\nhad not even picked up his wand ... \n\"Lily, take Harry and go! It's him! Go! Run! I'll hold him off!\" \nHold him off, without a wand in his hand! ... He laughed before casting the curse ... \n\"Avada Kedavra!\" \nThe green light filled the cramped hallway, it lit the pram pushed against the wall, it \nmade the banisters glow like lighting rods, and James Potter fell like a marionette whose \nstrings were cut ... \nHe could hear her screaming from the upper floor, trapped, but as long as she was \nsensible, she, at least, had nothing to fear ... He climbed the steps, listening with faint \namusement to her attempts to barricade herself in ... She had no wand upon her either ... \nHow stupid they were, and how trusting, thinking that their safety lay in friends, that \nweapons could be discarded even for moments... \nHe forced the door open, cast aside the chair and boxes hastily piled against it with one \nlazy wave of his wand ... and there she stood, the child in her arms. At the sight of him, \nshe dropped her son into the crib behind her and threw her arms wide, as if this would \nhelp, as if in shielding him from sight she hoped to be chosen instead ... \n\"Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry!\" \n\"Stand aside, you silly girl... stand aside, now.\" \n\"Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead --\" \n\"This is my last warning --\" \n\"Not Harry! Please ... have mercy ... have mercy ... Not Harry! Not Harry! Please -- I'll \ndo anything ...\" \n\"Stand aside. Stand aside, girl!\" \nHe could have forced her away from the crib, but it seemed more prudent to finish them \nall ... \nThe green light flashed around the room and she dropped like her husband. The child had \nnot cried all this time. He could stand, clutching the bars of his crib, and he looked up \ninto the intruder's face with a kind of bright interest, perhaps thinking that it was his \nfather who hid beneath the cloak, making more pretty lights, and his mother would pop \nup any moment, laughing -- \nHe pointed the wand very carefully into the boy's face: He wanted to see it happen, the \n\n\f\ndestruction of this one, inexplicable danger. The child began to cry: It had seen that he \nwas not James. He did not like it crying, he had never been able to stomach the small \nones whining in the orphanage -- \n\"Avada Kedavra!\" \nAnd then he broke. He was nothing, nothing but pain and terror, and he must hide himself, \nnot here in the rubble of the ruined house, where the child was trapped screaming, but far \naway ... far away ... \n\"No,\" he moaned. \nThe snake rustled on the filthy, cluttered floor, and he had killed the boy, and yet he was \nthe boy ... \n\"No...\" \nAnd now he stood at the broken window of Bathilda's house, immersed in memories of \nhis greatest loss, and at his feet the great snake slithered over broken china and glass... He \nlooked down and saw something... something incredible... \n\"No...\" \n\"Harry, it's all right, you're all right!\" \nHe stooped down and picked up the smashed photograph. There he was, the unknown \nthief, the thief he was seeking... \n\"No... I dropped it... I dropped it ...\" \n\"Harry, it's okay, wake up, wake up!\" \nHe was Harry... Harry, not Voldemort ... and the thing that was rustling was not a snake ... \nHe opened his eyes. \n\"Harry,\" Hermione whispered. \"Do you feel all -- all right?\" \n\"Yes,\" he lied. \nHe was in the tent, lying on one of the lower bunks beneath a heap of blankets. He could \ntell that it was almost dawn by the stillness and quality of the cold, flat light beyond the \ncanvas ceiling. He was drenched in sweat; he could feel it on the sheets and blankets. \n\"We got away.\" \n\"Yes,\" said Hermione. \"I had to use a Hover Charm to get you into your bunk. I couldn't \n\n\f\nlift you. You've been ... Well, you haven't been quite ...\" \nThere were purple shadows under her brown eyes and he noticed a small sponge in her \nhand: She had been wiping his face. \n\"You've been ill,\" she finished. \"Quite ill.\" \n\"How long ago did we leave?\" \n\"Hours ago. It's nearly morning.\" \n\"And I've been... what, unconscious?\" \n\"Not exactly,\" said Hermione uncomfortably. \"You've been shouting and moaning and ... \nthings,\" she added in a tone that made Harry feel uneasy. What had he done? Screamed \ncurses like Voldemort, cried like the baby in the crib? \n\"I couldn't get the Horcrux off you,\" Hermione said, and he knew she wanted to change \nthe subject. \"It was stuck, stuck to your chest. You've got a mark; I'm sorry, I had to use a \nSevering Charm to get it away. The snake hit you too, but I've cleaned the wound and put \nsome dittany on it ...\" \nHe pulled the sweaty T-shirt he was wearing away from himself and looked down. There \nwas a scarlet oval over his heart where the locket had burned him. He could also see the \nhalf healed puncture marks to his forearm. \n\"Where've you put the Horcrux?\" \n\"In my bag. I think we should keep it off for a while.\" \nHe lay back on his pillows and looked into her pinched gray face. \n\"We shouldn't have gone to Godric's Hollow. It's my fault, it's all my fault. Hermione, I'm \nsorry.\" \n\"It's not you fault. I wanted to go too; I really thought Dumbledore might have left the \nsword there for you.\" \n\"Yeah, well ... we got that wrong, didn't we?\" \n\"What happened, Harry? What happened when she took you upstairs? Was the snake \nhiding somewhere? Did it just come out and kill her and attack you?\" \n\"No.\" he said. \"She was the snake ... or the snake was her ... all along.\" \n\"W-what?\" \n\n\f\n He closed his eyes. He could still smell Bathilda's house on him; it made the whole thing \nhorribly vivid. \n\"Bathilda must've been dead a while. The snake was ... was inside her. You-Know-Who \nput it there in Godric's Hollow, to wait. You were right. He knew I'd go back.\" \n\"The snake was inside her?\" \nHe opened his eyes again. Hermione looked revolted, nauseated. \n\"Lupin said there would be magic we'd never imagined.\" Harry said. \"She didn't want to \ntalk in front of you, because it was Parseltongue, all Parseltongue, and I didn't realize, \nbut of course I could understand her. Once we were up in the room, the snake sent a \nmessage to You-Know-Who, I heard it happen inside my head, I felt him get excited, he \nsaid to keep me there ... and then ...\" \nHe remembered the snake coming out of Bathilda's neck: Hermione did not need to know \nthe details. \n\"...she changed, changed into the snake, and attacked.\" \nHe looked down at the puncture marks. \n\"It wasn't supposed to kill me, just keep me there till You-Know-Who came.\" \nIf he had only managed to kill the snake, it would have been worth it, all of it ... Sick at \nheart, he sat up and threw back the covers. \n\"Harry, no, I'm sure you ought to rest!\" \n\"You're the one who needs sleep. No offense, but you look terrible. I'm fine. I'll keep \nwatch for a while. Where's my wand?\" \nShe did not answer, she merely looked at him. \n\"Where's my wand, Hermione?\" \nShe was biting her lip, and tears swam in her eyes. \n\"Harry ...\" \n\"Where's my wand?\" \nShe reached down beside the bed and held it out to him. \n\n\n\f\nThe holly and phoenix wand was nearly severed in two. One fragile strand of phoenix \nfeather kept both pieces hanging together. The wood had splintered apart completely. \nHarry took it into his hands as though it was a living thing that had suffered a terrible \ninjury. He could not think properly: Everything was a blur of panic and fear. Then he \nheld out the want to Hermione. \n\"Mend it. Please.\" \n\"Harry, I don't think, when it's broken like this --\" \n\"Please, Hermione, try!\" \n\"R-Reparo.\" \nThe dangling half of the wand resealed itself. Harry held it up. \n\"Lumos!\" \nThe wand sparked feebly, then went out. Harry pointed it at Hermione. \n\"Expelliarmus!\" \nHermione's wand gave a little jerk, but did not leave her hand. The feeble attempt at \nmagic was too much for Harry's wand, which split into two again. He stared at it, aghast, \nunable to take in what he was seeing ... the wand that had survived so much ... \n\"Harry.\" Hermione whispered so quietly he could hardly hear her. \"I'm so, so sorry. I \nthink it was me. As we were leaving, you know, the snake was coming for us, and so I \ncast a Blasting Curse, and it rebounded everywhere, and it must have -- must have hit --\" \n\"It was an accident.\" said Harry mechanically. He felt empty, stunned. \"We'll -- we'll find \na way to repair it.\" \n\"Harry, I don't think we're going to be able to,\" said Hermione, the ears trickling down \nher face. \"Remember ... remember Ron? When he broke his wand, crashing the car? It \nwas never the same again, he had to get a new one.\" \nHarry thought of Ollivander, kidnapped and held hostage by Voldemort; of Gregorovitch, \nwho was dead. How was he supposed to find himself a new wand? \n\"Well,\" he said, in a falsely matter-of-fact voice, \"well, I'll just borrow yours for now, \nthen. While I keep watch.\" \nHer face glazed with tears, Hermione handed over her wand, and he left her sitting beside \nhis bed, desiring nothing more than to get away from her. \n\n \n\n\f\nChapter Eighteen \n\nThe Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore \n\nThe sun was coming up: The pure, colorless vastness of the sky stretched over \nhim, indifferent to him and his suffering. Harry sat down in the tent entrance and took a \ndeep breath of clean air. Simply to be alive to watch the sun rise over the sparkling snowy \nhillside ought to have been the greatest treasure on earth, yet he could not appreciate it: \nHis senses had been spiked by the calamity of losing his want. He looked out over a \nvalley blanketed in snow, distant church bells chiming through the glittering silence. \n\nWithout realizing it, he was digging his fingers into his arms as if he were trying \nto resist physical pain. He had spilled his own blood more times than he could count; he \nhad lost all bones in his right arm once; this journey had already given him scars to his \nchest and forearm to join those on his hand and forehead, but never, until this moment, \nhad he felt himself to be fatally weakened, vulnerable, and naked, as though the best part \nof his magical power had been torn from him. He knew exactly what Hermione would \nsay if he expressed any of this: The wand is only as good as the wizard. But she was \nwrong, his case was different. She had not felt the wand spin like the needle of a compass \nand shoot golden flames at his enemy. He had lost the protection of the twin cores, and \nonly now that it was gone did he realize how much he had been counting on it. \n\nHe pulled the pieces of the broken wand out of his pocket and, without looking at \nthem, tucked them away in Hagrid\u2019s pouch around his neck. The pouch was now too full \nof broken and useless objects to take any more. Harry\u2019s hand brushed the old Snitch \nthrough the mokeskin and for a moment he had to fight the temptation to pull it out and \nthrow it away. Impenetrable, unhelpful, useless, like everything else Dumbledore had left \nbehind --- \n\nAnd his fury at Dumbledore broke over him now like lava, scorching him inside, \nwiping out every other feeling. Out of sheer desperation they had talked themselves into \nbelieving that Godric\u2019s Hollow held answers, convinced themselves that they were \nsupposed to go back, that it was all part of some secret path laid out for them by \nDumbledore: but there was no map, no plan. Dumbledore had left them to grope in the \ndarkness, to wrestle with unknown and undreamed-of terrors, alone and unaided: Nothing \nwas explained, nothing was given freely, they had no sword, and now, Harry had no \nwand. And he had dropped the photograph of the thief, and it would surely be easy now \nfor Voldemort to find out who he was . . . \n\nVoldemort had all the information now . . . \n\n\u201cHarry?\u201d \n\nHermione looked frightened that he might curse her with her own wand. Her face \nstreaked with tears, she crouched down beside him, two cups of tea trembling in her \nhands and something bulky under her arm. \n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d he said, taking one of the cups. \n\n\u201cDo you mind if I talk to you?\u201d \n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said because he did not want to hurt her feelings. \n\n\u201cHarry, you wanted to know who that man in the picture was. Well . . . I\u2019ve got \nthe book.\u201d \n\nTimidly she pushed it onto his lap, a pristine copy of The Life and Lies of Albus \nDumbledore. \n\n\f\n\u201cWhere --- how --- ?\u201d \n\n\u201cIt was in Bathilda\u2019s sitting room, just lying there. . . . This note was sticking out \nof the top of it.\u201d \n\nHermione read the few lines of spiky, acid-green writing aloud. \n\n\u201c \u2018Dear Bally, Thanks for your help. Here\u2019s a copy of the book, hope you like it. \nYou said everything, even if you don\u2019t remember it. Rita.\u2019 I think it must have arrived \nwhile the real Bathilda was alive, but perhaps she wasn\u2019t in any fit state to read it?\u201d \n\n\u201cNo, she probably wasn\u2019t.\u201d \n\nHarry looked down upon Dumbledore\u2019s face and experienced a surge of savage \npleasure: Now he would know if all the things that Dumbledore had never thought it \nworth telling him, whether Dumbledore wanted him to or not. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re still really angry at me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d said Hermione; he looked up to see \nfresh tears leaking out of her eyes, and knew that his anger must have shown in his face. \n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cNo, Hermione, I know it was an accident. You were trying \nto get us out of there alive, and you were incredible. I\u2019d be dead if you hadn\u2019t been there \nto help me.\u201d \n\nHe tried to return her watery smile, then turned his attention to the book. Its spine \nwas stiff; it had clearly never been opened before. He riffled through the pages, looking \nfor photographs. He came across the one he sought almost at once, the young \nDumbledore and his handsome companion, roaring with laughter at some long-forgotten \njoke. Harry dropped his eyes to the caption. \n\n \n\nAlbus Dumbledore, shortly after his mother\u2019s death, \n\nWith his friend Gellert Grindelwald. \n\n \n\nHarry gaped at the last word for several long moments. Grindelwald. His friend \nGrindelwald. He looked sideways at Hermione, who was still contemplating the name as \nthough she could not believe her eyes. Slowly she looked up at Harry. \n\n\u201cGrindelwald!\u201d \n\nIgnoring the remainder of the photographs, Harry searched the pages around them \nfor a recurrence of that fatal name. He soon discovered it and read greedily, but became \nlost: It was necessary to go farther back to make sense of it all, and eventually he found \nhimself at the start of a chapter entitled \u201cThe Greater Good.\u201d Together, he and Hermione \nstarted to read: \n\n \n\nNow approaching his eighteenth birthday, Dumbledore left Hogwarts in a blaze \nof glory --- Head Boy, Prefect, Winner of the Barnabus Finkley Prize for \nExceptional Spell-Casting, British Youth Representative to the Wizengamot, \nGold Medal-Winner for Ground-Breaking Contribution to the International \nAlchemical Conference in Cairo. Dumbledore intended, next, to take a Grand \nTour with Elphias \u201cDogbreath\u201d Doge, the dim-witted but devoted sidekick he \nhad picked up at school. \n\nThe two young men were staying at the Leaky Cauldron in London, \npreparing to depart for Greece the following morning, when an owl arrived \nbearing news of Dumbledore\u2019s mother\u2019s death. \u201cDogbreath\u201d Doge, who refused \nto be interviewed for this book, has given the public his own sentimental \n\n\f\nversion of what happened next. He represents Kendra\u2019s death as a tragic blow, \nand Dumbledore\u2019s decision to give up his expedition as an act of noble self-\nsacrifice. \n\nCertainly Dumbledore returned to Godric\u2019s Hollow at once, supposedly to \n\u201ccare\u201d for his younger brother and sister. But how much care did he actually \ngive them? \n\n\u201cHe were a head case, that Aberforth,\u201d said Enid Smeek, whose family lived \non the outskirts of Godric\u2019s Hollow at that time. \u201cRan wild. \u2018Course, with his \nmum and dad gone you\u2019d have felt sorry for him, only he kept chucking goat \ndung at my head. I don\u2019t think Albus was fussed about him. I never saw them \ntogether, anyway.\u201d \n\nSo what was Albus doing, if not comforting his wild young brother? The \nanswer, it seems, is ensuring the continued imprisonment of his sister. For \nthough her first jailer had died, there was no change in the pitiful condition of \nAriana Dumbledore. Her very existence continued to be known only to those \nfew outsiders who, like \u201cDogbreath\u201d Doge, could be counted upon to believe in \nthe story of her \u201cill health.\u201d \n\nAnother such easily satisfied friend of the family was Bathilda Bagshot, the \ncelebrated magical historian who has lived in Godric\u2019s Hollow for many years. \nKendra, of course, had rebuffed Bathilda when she first attempted to welcome \nthe family to the village. Several years later, however, the author sent an owl to \nAlbus at Hogwarts, having been favorably impressed by his paper on trans-\nspecies transformation in Transfiguration Today. This initial contract led to \nacquaintance with the entire Dumbledore family. At the time of Kendra\u2019s death, \nBathilda was the only person in Godric\u2019s Hollow who was on speaking terms \nwith Dumbledore\u2019s mother. \n\nUnfortunately, the brilliance that Bathilda exhibited earlier in her life has \nnow dimmed. \u201cThe fire\u2019s lit, but the cauldron\u2019s empty,\u201d as Ivor Dillonsby put it \nto me, or, in Enid Smeek\u2019s slightly earthier phrase, \u201cShe\u2019s nutty as squirrel \npoo.\u201d Nevertheless, a combination of tried-and-tested reporting techniques \nenabled me to extract enough nuggets of hard fact to string together the whole \nscandalous story. \n\nLike the rest of the Wizarding world, Bathilda puts Kendra\u2019s premature death \ndown to a backfiring charm, a story repeated by Albus and Aberforth in later \nyears. Bathilda also parrots the family line on Ariana, calling her \u201cfrail\u201d and \n\u201cdelicate.\u201d On one subject, however, Bathilda is well worth the effort I put into \nprocuring Veritaserum, for she, and she alone, knows the full story of the best-\nkept secret of Albus Dumbledore\u2019s life. Now revealed for the first time, it calls \ninto question everything that his admirers believed of Dumbledore: his \nsupposed hatred of the Dark Arts, his opposition into the oppression of Muggles, \neven his devotion to his own family. \n\nThe very same summer that Dumbledore went home to Godric\u2019s Hollow, \nnow an orphan and head of the family, Bathilda Bagshot agreed to accept into \nher home her great-nephew, Gellert Grindelwald. \n\nThe name of Grindelwald is justly famous: In a list of Most Dangerous Dark \nWizards of All Time, he would miss out on the top spot only because You-\n\n\f\nKnow-Who arrived, a generation later, to steal his crown. As Grindelwald never \nextended his campaign of terror to Britain, however, the details of his rise to \npower are not widely known here. \n\nEducated at Durmstrang, a school famous even then for its unfortunate \ntolerance of the Dark Arts, Grindelwald showed himself quite as precociously \nbrilliant as Dumbledore. Rather than channel his abilities into the attainment of \nawards and prizes, however, Gellert Grindelwald devoted himself no other \npursuits. At sixteen years old, even Durmstrang felt it could no longer turn a \nblind eye to the twisted experiments of Gellert Grindelwald, and he was \nexpelled. \n\nHitherto, all that has been known of Grindelwald\u2019s next movements is that he \n\u201ctraveled around for some months.\u201d It can now be revealed that Grindelwald \nchose to visit his great-aunt in Godric\u2019s Hollow, and that there, intensely \nshocking though it will be for many to hear it, he struck up a close friendship \nwith none other than Albus Dumbledore. \n\n\u201cHe seemed a charming boy to me,\u201d babbles Bathilda, \u201cwhatever he became \nlater. Naturally I introduced him to poor Albus, who was missing the company \nof lads his own age. The boys took to each other at once.\u201d \n\nThey certainly did. Bathilda shows me a letter, kept by her that Albus \nDumbledore sent Gellert Grindelwald in the dead of night. \n\n\u201cYes, even after they\u2019d spent all day in discussion --- both such brilliant \nyoung boys, they got on like a cauldron on fire --- I\u2019d sometimes hear an owl \ntapping at Gellert\u2019s bedroom window, delivering a letter from Albus! An idea \nwould have struck him and he had to let Gellert know immediately!\u201d \n\nAnd what ideas they were. Profoundly shocking though Albus Dumbledore\u2019s \nfans will find it, here are the thoughts of their seventeen-year-old hero, as \nrelayed to his new best friend. (A copy of the original letter may be seen on \npage 463.) \n\n \n\nGellert --- \n\nYour point about Wizard dominance being FOR THE MUGGLES\u2019 \nOWN GOOD --- this, I think, is the crucial point. Yes, we have been given \npower and yes, that power gives us the right to rule, but it also gives us \nresponsibilities over the ruled. We must stress this point, it will be the \nfoundation stone upon which we build. Where we are opposed, as we \nsurely will be, this must be the basis of all our counterarguments. We seize \ncontrol FOR THE GREATER GOOD. And from this it follows that where \nwe meet resistance, we must use only the force that is necessary and no \nmore. (This was your mistake at Durmstrang! But I do not complain, \nbecause if you had not been expelled, we would never have met.) \n\nAlbus \n\n \n\nAstonished and appalled though his many admirers will be, this letter \nconstitutes the Statute of Secrecy and establishing Wizard rule over Muggles. \nWhat a blow for those who have always portrayed Dumbledore as the Muggle-\nborns\u2019 greatest champion! How hollow those speeches promoting Muggle rights \n\n\f\nseem in the light of this damning new evidence! How despicable does Albus \nDumbledore appear, busy plotting his rise to power when he should have been \nmourning his mother and caring for his sister! \n\nNo doubt those determined to keep Dumbledore on his crumbling pedestal \nwill bleat that he did not, after all, put his plans into action, that he must have \nsuffered a change of heart, that he came to his senses. However, the truth seems \naltogether more shocking. \n\nBarely two months into their great new friendship, Dumbledore and \nGrindelwald parted, never to see each other again until they met for their \nlegendary duel (for more, see chapter 22). What caused this abrupt rupture? Had \nDumbledore come to his senses? Had he told Grindelwald he wanted no more \npart in his plans? Alas, no. \n\n\u201cIt was poor little Ariana dying, I think, that did it,\u201d says Bathilda. \u201cIt came \nas an awful shock. Gellert was there in the house when it happened, and he \ncame back to my house all of a dither, told me he wanted to go home the next \nday. Terribly distressed, you know. So I arranged a Portkey and that was the last \nI saw of him. \n\n\u201cAlbus was beside himself at Ariana\u2019s death. It was so dreadful for those two \nbrothers. They had lost everybody except for each other. No wonder tempers \nran a little high. Aberforth blamed Albus, you know, as people will under these \ndreadful circumstances. But Aberforth always talked a little madly, poor boy. \nAll the same, breaking Albus\u2019s nose at the funeral was not decent. It would have \ndestroyed Kendra to see her sons fighting like that, across her daughter\u2019s body. \nA shame Gellert could not have stayed for the funeral. . . . He would have been \na comfort to Albus, at least. . . . \n\nThis dreadful coffin-side brawl, known only to those few who attended \nAriana Dumbledore\u2019s funeral, raises several questions. Why exactly did \nAberforth Dumbledore blame Albus for his sister\u2019s death? Was it, as \u201cBatty\u201d \npretends, a mere effusion of grief? Or could there have been some more \nconcrete reason for his fury? Grindelwald, expelled from Durmstrang for the \nnear-fatal attacks upon fellow students, fled the country hours after the girl\u2019s \ndeath, and Albus (out of shame or fear?) never saw him again, not until forced \nto do so by the pleas of the Wizarding world. \n\nNeither Dumbledore nor Grindelwald ever seems to have referred to this \nbrief boyhood friendship in later life. However, there can be no doubt that \nDumbledore delayed, for some five years of turmoil, fatalities, and \ndisappearances, his attack upon Gellert Grindelwald. Was it lingering affection \nfor the man or fear of exposure as his once best friend that caused Dumbledore \nto hesitate? Was it only reluctantly that Dumbledore set out to capture the man \nhe was once so delighted he had met? \n\nAnd how did the mysterious Ariana die? Was she the inadvertent victim of \nsome Dark rite? Did she stumble across something she ought not to have done, \nas the two young men sat practicing for their attempt at glory and domination? \nIs it possible that Ariana Dumbledore was the first person to die \u201cfor the greater \ngood\u201d? \n\n \n\n\f\nThe chapter ended here and Harry looked up. Hermione had reached the bottom \nof the page before him. She tugged the book out of Harry\u2019s hands, looking a little \nalarmed by his expression, and closed it without looking at it, as though hiding something \nindecent. \n\n\u201cHarry ---\u201d \n\nBut he shook his head. Some inner certainty had crashed down inside him; it was \nexactly as he had felt after Ron left. He had trusted Dumbledore, believed him the \nembodiment of goodness and wisdom. All was ashes: How much more could he lose? \nRon, Dumbledore, the phoenix wand . . . \n\n\u201cHarry.\u201d She seemed to have heard his thoughts. \"Listen to me. It --- it doesn't \nmake a very nice reading ---\" \n\n\"Yeah, you could say that ---\" \n\n\"--- but don't forget, Harry, this is Rita Skeeter writing.\" \n\n\"You did read that letter to Grindelwald, didn't you?\" \n\n\"Yes, I --- I did.\" She hesitated, looking upset, cradling her tea in her cold hands. \n\"I think that's the worst bit. I know Bathilda thought it was all just talk, but 'For the \nGreater Good' became Grindelwald's slogan, his justification for all the atrocities he \ncommitted later. And . . . from that . . . it looks like Dumbledore gave him the idea. They \nsay 'For the Greater Good' was even carved over the entrance to Nurmengard.\" \n\n\"What's Nurmengard?\" \n\n\"The prison Grindelwald had built to hold his opponents. He ended up in there \nhimself, once Dumbledore had caught him. Anyway, it's --- it\u2019s an awful thought that \nDumbledore's ideas helped Grindelwald rise to power. But on the other hand, even Rita \ncan't pretend that they knew each other for more than a few months one summer when \nthey were both really young, and ---\" \n\n\"I thought you'd say that,\" said Harry. He did not want to let his anger spill out at \nher, but it was hard to keep his voice steady. \"I thought you'd say 'They were young.' \nThey were the same age as we are now. And here we are, risking our lives to fight the \nDark Arts, and there he was, in a huddle with his new best friend, plotting their rise to \npower over the Muggles.\" \n\nHis temper would not remain in check much longer: He stood up and walked \naround, trying to work some of it off. \n\n\"I'm not trying to defend what Dumbledore wrote,\" said Hermione. \"All that 'right \nto rule' rubbish, it's 'Magic Is Might' all over again. But Harry, his mother had just died, \nhe was stuck alone in the house ---\" \n\n\"Alone? He wasn't alone! He had his brother and sister for company, his Squib \nsister he was keeping locked up ---\" \n\n\"I don't believe it,\" said Hermione. She stood up too. \"Whatever was wrong with that \ngirl, I don't think she was a Squib. The Dumbledore we knew would never, ever have \nallowed---\" \n\n\"The Dumbledore we thought we knew didn't want to conquer Muggles by force!\" \nHarry shouted, his voice echoing across the empty hilltop, and several blackbirds rose \ninto the air, squawking and spiraling against the pearly sky. \n\n\"He changed, Harry, he changed! It's as simple as that! Maybe he did believe \nthese things when he was seventeen, but the whole of the rest of his life was devoted to \nfighting the Dark Arts! Dumbledore was the one who stopped Grindelwald, the one who \n\n\f\nalways voted for Muggle protection and Muggle born rights, who fought You-Know-\nWho from the start, and who died trying to bring him down!\" \n\nRita's book lay on the ground between them, so that the face of Albus \nDumbledore smiled dolefully at both. \n\n\"Harry, I'm sorry, but I think the real reason you're so angry is that Dumbledore \nnever told you any of this himself.\" \n\n\"Maybe I am!\" Harry bellowed, and he flung his arms over his head, hardly \nknowing whether he was trying to hold in his anger or protect himself from the weight of \nhis own disillusionment. \"Look what he asked from me, Hermione! Risk your life, Harry! \nAnd again! And again! And don't expect me to explain everything, just trust me blindly, \ntrust that I know what I'm doing, trust me even though I don't trust you! Never the whole \ntruth! Never!\" \n\nHis voice cracked with the strain, and they stood looking at each other in the \nwhiteness and emptiness, and Harry felt they were as insignificant as insects beneath that \nwide sky. \n\n\"He loved you,\" Hermione whispered. \"I know he loved you.\" \n\nHarry dropped his arms. \n\n\"I don't know who he loved, Hermione, but it was never me. This isn't love, the \nmess he's left me in. He shared a damn sight more of what he was really thinking with \nGellert Grindelwald than he ever shared with me.\" \n\nHarry picked up Hermione's wand, which he had dropped in the snow, and sat \nback down in the entrance of the tent. \n\n\"Thanks for the tea. I'll finish the watch. You get back in the warm.\" \n\nShe hesitated, but recognized the dismissal. She picked up the book and then walked \nback past him into the tent, but as she did so, she brushed the top of his head lightly with \nher hand. He closed his eyes at her touch, and hated himself for wishing that what she \nsaid was true: that Dumbledore had really cared. \n\n \n\nChapter Nineteen \n\nThe Silver Doe \n\n \n\n It was snowing by the time Hermione took over the watch at midnight. Harry's \ndreams were confused and disturbing: Nagini wove in and out of them, first through a \nwreath of Christmas roses. He woke repeatedly, panicky, convinced that somebody had \ncalled out to him in the distance, imagining that the wind whipping around the tent was \nfootsteps or voices. \n\n Finally he got up in the darkness and joined Hermione, who was huddled in the \nentrance to the tent reading A History of Magic by the light of her wand. The snow was \nfalling thickly, and she greeted with relief his suggestion of packing up early and moving \non. \n\n \"We'll somewhere more sheltered,\" she agreed, shivering as she pulled on a \nsweatshirt over her pajamas. \"I kept thinking I could hear people moving outside. I even \nthough I saw somebody one or twice.\" \n\n\f\n Harry paused in the act of pulling on a jumper and glanced at the silent, \nmotionless Sneakoscope on the table. \n\n \"I'm sure I imagined it,\" said Hermione, looking nervous. \"The snow the dark, it \nplays tricks on your eyes.... But perhaps we ought to Disapparate under the Invisibility \nCloak, just in case?\" \n\n Half an hour later, with the tent packed, Harry wearing the Horcrux, and \nHermione clutching the beaded bag, they Disapparated. The usual tightness engulfed \nthem; Harry's feet parted company with the snowy ground, then slammed hard onto what \nfelt like frozen earth covered in leaves. \n\n \"Where are we?\" he asked, peering around at the fresh mass of trees as Hermione \nopened the beaded bag and began tugging out the tent poles. \n\n \"The Forest of Dean,\" she said, \"I came camping here once with my mum and \ndad.\" \n\n Here too snow lay on the trees all around and it was bitterly cold, but they were at \nleast protected from the wind. They spent most of the day inside the tent, huddled for \nwarmth around the useful bright blue flames that Hermione was adept at producing, and \nwhich could be scooped up and carried in a jar. Harry felt as though he was recuperating \nfrom some brief but severe, an impression reinforced by Hermione's solicitousness. That \nafternoon fresh flakes drifted down upon them, so that even their sheltered clearing had a \nfresh dusting of powdery snow. \n\n After two nights of little sleep, Harry's senses seemed more alert than usual. \nTheir escape from Godric's Hollow had been so narrow that Voldemort seemed somehow \ncloser than before, more threatening. As darkness drove in again Harry refused \nHermione's offer to keep watch and told her to go to bed. \n\n Harry moved an old cushion into the tent mouth and sat down, wearing all the \nsweaters he owned but even so, still shivery. The darkness deepened with the passing \nhours until it was virtually impenetrable. He was on the point of taking out the \nMarauder's Map, so as to watch Ginny's dot for a while, before he remembered that it was \nthe Christmas holidays and that she would be back at the Burrow. \n\n Every tiny movement seemed magnified in the vastness of the forest. Harry knew \nthat it must be full of living creatures, but he wished they would all remain still and silent \nso that he could separate their innocent scurryings and prowlings from noises that might \nproclaim other, sinister movements. He remembered the sound of a cloak slithering over \ndead leaves many years ago, and at once thought he heard it again before mentally \nshaking himself. Their protective enchantments had worked for weeks; why should they \nbreak now? And yet he could no throw off the feeling that something was different \ntonight. \n\n Several times he jerked upright, his neck aching because he had fallen asleep, \nslumped at an awkward angle against the side of the tent. The night reached such a depth \nof velvety blackness that he might have been suspended in limbo between Disapparation \nand Apparation. He had just held a hand in front of his face to see whether he could \nmake out his fingers when it happened. \n\n A bright silver light appeared right ahead of him, moving through the trees. \nWhatever the source, it was moving soundlessly. The light seemed simply to drift toward \nhim. \n\n\f\n He jumped to his feet, his voice frozen in his throat, and raised Hermione's wand. \nHe screwed up his eyes as the light became blinding, the trees in front of it pitch black in \nsilhouette, and still the thing came closer.... \n\n And then the source of the light stepped out from behind an oak. It was a silver \nwhite doe, moon-bright and dazzling, picking her way over the ground, still silent, and \nleaving no hoofprints in the fine powdering of snow. She stepped toward him, her \nbeautiful head with its wide, long-lashed eyes held high. \n\n Harry stared at the creature, filled with wonder, not at her strangeness, but her \ninexplicable familiarity. He felt that he had been waiting for her to come, but that he had \nforgotten, until this moment, that they had arranged to meet. His impulse to shout for \nHermione, which had been so strong a moment ago, had gone. He knew, he would have \nstaked his life on it, that she had come for him, and him alone. \n\n They gazed at each other for several long moments and then she turned and \nwalked away. \n\n \"No,\" he said, and his voice was cracked with lack of use. \"Come back!\" \n\n She continued to step deliberately through the trees, and soon he brightness was \nstriped by their thick black trunks. For one trembling second he hesitated. Caution \nmurmured it could be a trick, a lure, a trap. But instinct, overwhelming instinct, told him \nthat this was not Dark Magic. He set off in pursuit. \n\n Snow crunched beneath his feet, but the doe made no noise as she passed through \nthe trees, for she was nothing but light. Deeper and deeper into the forest she led him, \nand Harry walked quickly, sure that when she stopped, she would allow him to approach \nher properly. And then she would speak and the voice would tell him what he needed to \nknow. \n\n At last she came to a halt. She turned her beautiful head toward him once more, \nand he broke into a run, a question burning in him, but as he opened his lips to ask it, she \nvanished. \n\n Though the darkness had swallowed her whole, her burnished image was still \nimprinted on his retinas; it obscured his vision, brightening when he lowered his eyelids, \ndisorienting him. Now fear came: Her presence had meant safety. \n\n \"Lumos!\" he whispered, and the wand-tip ignited. \n\n The imprint of the doe faded away with every blink of his eyes as he stood there, \nlistening to the sounds of the forest, to distant crackles of twigs, soft swishes of snow. \nWas he about to be attacked? Had she enticed him into an ambush? Was he imagining \nthat somebody stood beyond the reach of the wandlight, watching him? \n\n He held the wand higher. Nobody ran out at him, no flash of green light burst \nfrom behind a tree. Why, then, had she led him to this spot? \n\n Something gleamed in the light of the wand, and Harry spun about, but all that \nwas there was a small, frozen pool, its black, cracked surface glittering as he raised his \nwand higher to examine it. \n\n He moved forward rather cautiously and looked down. The ice reflected his \ndistorted shadow and the beam of wandlight, but deep below the thick, misty gray \ncarapace, something else glinted. A great silver cross... \n\n His heart skipped into his mouth: He dropped to his knees at the pool's edge and \nangled the wand so as to flood the bottom of the pool with as much light as possible. A \n\n\f\nglint of deep red...It was a sword with glittering rubies in its hilt....The sword of \nGryffindor was lying at the bottom of the forest pool. \n\n Barely breathing, he stared down at it. How was this possible? How could it \nhave come to be lying in a forest pool, this close to the place where they were camping? \nHad some unknown magic drawn Hermione to this spot, or was the doe, which he had \ntaken to be a Patronus, some kind of guardian of the pool? Or had the sword been put \ninto the pool after they had arrived, precisely because they were here? In which case, \nwhere was the person who wanted to pass it to Harry? Again he directed the wand at the \nsurrounding trees and bushes, searching for a human outline, for the glint of an eye, but \nhe could not see anyone there. All the same, a little more fear leavened his exhilaration \nas he returned his attention to the sword reposing upon the bottom of the frozen pool. \n\n He pointed the wand at the silvery shape and murmured, \"Accio Sword.\" \n\n It did not stir. He had not expected it to. If it had been that easy the sword would \nhave lain on the ground for him to pick up, not in the depths of a frozen pool. He set off \naround the circle of ice, thinking hard about the last time the sword had delivered itself to \nhim. He had been in terrible danger then, and had asked for help. \n\n \"Help,\" he murmured, but the sword remained upon the pool bottom, indifferent, \nmotionless. \n\n What was it, Harry asked himself (walking again), that Dumbledore had told him \nthe last time he had retrieved the sword? Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that \nout of the hat. And what were the qualities that defined a Gryffindor? A small voice \ninside Harry's head answered him: Their daring nerve and chivalry set Gryffindor apart. \n\n Harry stopped walking and let out a long sigh, his smoky breath dispersing \nrapidly upon the frozen air. He knew what he had to do. If he was honest with himself, \nhe had thought it might come to this from the moment he had spotted the sword through \nthe ice. \n\n He glanced around at the surrounding trees again, but was convinced now that \nnobody was going to attack him. They had had their chance as he walked alone through \nthe forest, had had plenty of opportunity as he examined the pool. The only reason to \ndelay at this point was because the immediate prospect was so deeply uninviting. \n\n With fumbling fingers Harry started to remove his many layers of clothing. \nWhere \"chivalry\" entered into this, he thought ruefully, he was not entirely sure, unless it \ncounted as chivalrous that he was not calling for Hermione to do it in his stead. \n\n An owl hooted somewhere as he stripped off, and he thought with a pang of \nHedwig. He was shivering now, his teeth chattering horribly, and yet he continued to \nstrip off until at last he stood there in his underwear, barefooted in the snow. He placed \nthe pouch containing his wand, his mother's letter, the shard of Sirius's mirror, and the old \nSnitch on top of his clothes, then he pointed Hermione's wand at the ice. \n\n \"Diffindo.\" \n\n It cracked with a sound like a bullet in the silence. The surface of the pool broke \nand chunks of dark ice rocked on the ruffled water. As far as Harry could judge, it was \nnot deep, but to retrieve the sword he would have to submerge himself completely. \n\n Contemplating the task ahead would not make it easier or the water warmer. He \nstepped to the pool's edge and placed Hermione's wand on the ground still lit. Then, \ntrying not to imagine how much colder he was about to become or how violently he \nwould soon be shivering, he jumped. \n\n\f\n Every pore of his body screamed in protest. The very air in his lungs seemed to \nfreeze solid as he was submerged to his shoulders in the frozen water. He could hardly \nbreathe: trembling so violently the water lapped over the edges of the pool, he felt for the \nblade with his numb feet. He only wanted to dive once. \n\n Harry put off the moment of total submersion from second to second, gasping and \nshaking, until he told himself that it must be done, gathered all his courage, and dived. \n\n The cold was agony: It attacked him like fire. His brain itself seemed to have \nfrozen as he pushed through the dark water to the bottom and reached out, groping for the \nsword. His fingers closed around the hilt; he pulled it upward. \n\n Then something closed tight around his neck. He thought of water weeds, though \nnothing had brushed him as he dived, and raised his hand to free himself. It was not \nweed: The chain of the Horcrux had tightened and was slowly constricting his windpipe. \n\n Harry kicked out wildly, trying to push himself back to the surface, but merely \npropelled himself into the rocky side of the pool. Thrashing, suffocating, he scrabbled at \nthe strangling chain, his frozen fingers unable to loosen it, and now little lights were \npopping inside his head, and he was going to drown, there was nothing left, nothing he \ncould do, and the arms that closed around his chest were surely Death's.... \n\n Choking and retching, soaking and colder than he had ever been in his life, he \ncame to facedown in the snow. Somewhere, close by, another person was panting and \ncoughing and staggering around, as she had come when the snake attacked....Yet it did \nnot sound like her, not with those deep coughs, no judging by the weight of the \nfootsteps.... \n\n Harry had no strength to lift his head and see his savior's identity. All he could do \nwas raise a shaking hand to his throat and feel the place where the locket had cut tightly \ninto his flesh. It was gone. Someone had cut him free. Then a panting voice spoke from \nover his head. \n\n \"Are -- you -- mental?\" \n\n Nothing but the shock of hearing that voice could have given Harry the strength to \nget up. Shivering violently, he staggered to his feet. There before him stood Ron, fully \ndressed but drenched to the skin, his hair plastered to his face, the sword of Gryffindor in \none hand and the Horcrux dangling from its broken chain in the other. \n\n \"Why the hell,\" panted Ron, holding up the Horcrux, which swung backward and \nforward on its shortened chain in some parody of hypnosis, \"didn't you take the thing off \nbefore you dived?\" \n\n Harry could not answer. The silver doe was nothing, nothing compared with \nRon's reappearance; he could not believe it. Shuddering with cold, he caught up the pile \nof clothes still lying at the water's edge and began to pull them on. As he dragged \nsweater after sweater over his head, Harry stared at Ron, half expecting him to have \ndisappeared every time he lost sight of him, and yet he had to be real: He had just dived \ninto the pool, he had saved Harry's life. \n\n \"It was y-you?\" Harry said at last, his teeth chattering, his voice weaker than usual \ndue to his near-strangulation. \n\n \"Well, yeah,\" said Ron, looking slightly confused. \n\n \"Y-you cast that doe?\" \n\n \"What? No, of course not! I thought it was you doing it!\" \n\n \"My Patronus is a stag.\" \n\n\f\n \"Oh yeah. I thought it looked different. No antlers.\" \n\n Harry put Hagrid's pouch back around his neck, pulled on a final sweater, stooped \nto pick up Hermione's wand, and faced Ron again. \n\n \"How come you're here?\" \n\n Apparently Ron had hoped that this point would come up later, if at all. \n\n \"Well, I've -- you know -- I've come back. If --\" He cleared his throat. \"You \nknow. You still want me.\" \n\n There was a pause, in which the subject of Ron's departure seemed to rise like a \nwall between them. Yet he was here. He had returned. He had just saved Harry's life. \n\n Ron looked down at his hands. He seemed momentarily surprised to see the \nthings he was holding. \n\n \"Oh yeah, I got it out,\" he said, rather unnecessarily, holding up the sword for \nHarry's inspection. \"That's why you jumped in, right?\" \n\n \"Yeah,\" said Harry. \"But I don't understand. How did you get here? How did \nyou find us?\" \n\n \"Long story,\" said Ron. \"I've been looking for you for hours, it's a big forest, isn't \nit? And I was just thinking I'd have to go kip under a tree and wait for morning when I \nsaw that dear coming and you following.\" \n\n \"You didn't see anyone else?\" \n\n \"No,\" said Ron. \"I --\" \n\n But he hesitated, glancing at two trees growing close together some yards away. \n\n \"I did think I saw something move over there, but I was running to the pool at the \ntime, because you'd gone in and you hadn't come up, so I wasn't going to make a detour \nto -- hey!\" \n\n Harry was already hurrying to the place that Ron had indicated. The two oaks \ngrew close together; there was a gap of only a few inches between the trunks at eye level, \nan ideal place to see but not be seen. The ground around the roots, however, was free of \nsnow, and Harry could see no sign of footprints. He walked back to where Ron stood \nwaiting, still holding the sword and the Horcrux. \n\n \"Anything there?\" Ron asked. \n\n \"No,\" said Harry. \n\n \"So how did the sword get in that pool?\" \n\n \"Whoever cast the Patronus must have put it there.\" \n\n They both looked at the ornate silver sword, its rubied hilt glinting a little in the \nlight from Hermione's wand. \n\n \"You reckon this is the real one?\" asked Ron. \n\n \"One way to find out, isn't there?\" said Harry. \n\n The Horcrux was still swinging from Ron's hand. The locket was twitching \nslightly. Harry knew that the thing inside it was agitated again. It had sensed the \npresence of the sword and had tried to kill Harry rather than let him possess it. Now was \nnot the time for long discussions; now was the moment to destroy once and for all. Harry \nlooked around, holding Hermione's wand high, and saw the place: a flattish rock lying in \nthe shadow of a sycamore tree. \n\n \"Come here.\" he said and he led the way, brushed snow from the rock's surface, \nand held out his hand for the Horcrux. When Ron offered the sword, however, Harry \nshook his head. \n\n\f\n \"No you should do it.\" \n\n \"Me?\" said Ron, looking shocked. \"Why?\" \n\n \"Because you got the sword out of the pool. I think it's supposed to be you.\" \n\n He was not being kind or generous. As certainly as he had known that the doe \nwas benign, he knew that Ron had to be the one to wield the sword. Dumbledore had at \nleast taught Harry something about certain kinds of magic, of the incalculable power of \ncertain acts. \n\n \"I'm going to open it,\" said Harry, \"and you will stab it. Straightaway okay? \nBecause whatever's in there will put up a fight. The bit of Riddle in the Diary tried to kill \nme.\" \n\n \"How are you going to open it?\" asked Ron. He looked terrified \n\n \"I'm going to ask it to open, using Parseltongue,\" said Harry. The answer came so \nreadily to his lips that thought that he had always known it deep down: Perhaps it had \ntaken his recent encounter with Nagini to make him realize it. He looked at the \nserpentine S, inlaid with glittering green stones: It was easy to visualize it as a miniscule \nsnake, curled upon the cold rock. \n\n \"No!\" said Ron. \"Don't open it! I'm serious!\" \n\n \"Why not?\" asked Harry. \"Let's get rid of the damn thing, it's been months --\" \n\n \"I can't, Harry, I'm serious -- you do it --\" \n\n \"But why?\" \n\n \"Because that thing's bad for me!\" said Ron, backing away from the locket on the \nrock. \"I can't handle it! I'm not making excuses, for what I was like, but it affects me \nworse than it affects you and Hermione, it made me think stuff -- stuff that I was thinking \nanyway, but it made everything worse. I can't explain it, and then I'd take it off and I'd \nget my head straight again, and then I'd have to put the effing thing back on -- I can't do it \nHarry!\" \n\n He had backed away, the sword dragging at his side, shaking his head. \n\n \"You can do it,\" said Harry, \"you can! You've just got the sword, I know it's \nsupposed to be you who uses it. Please just get rid of it Ron.\" \n\n The sound of his name seemed to act like a stimulant. Ron swallowed, then still \nbreathing hard through his long nose, moved back toward the rock. \n\n \"Tell me when,\" he croaked. \n\n \"On three,\" said Harry, looking back down at the locket and narrowing his eyes, \nconcentrating on the letter S, imagining a serpent, while the contents of the locket rattled \nlike a trapped cockroach. It would have been easy to pity it, except that the cut around \nHarry's neck still burned. \n\n \"One . . . two . . . three . . .open.\" \n\n The last word came as a hiss and a snarl and the golden doors of the locket swung \nwide open with a little click. \n\n Behind both of the glass windows within blinked a living eye, dark and handsome \nas Tom Riddle's eyes had been before he turned them scarlet and slit-pupiled \n\n \"Stab,\" said Harry, holding the locket steady on the rock. \n\n Ron raised the sword in his shaking hands: The point dangled over the frantically \nswiveling eyes, and Harry gripped the locket tightly, bracing himself, already imagining \nblood pouring from the empty windows. \n\n Then a voice hissed from out the Horcrux. \n\n\f\n \"I have seen your heart, and it is mine.\" \n\n \"Don't listen to it!\" Harry said harshly. \"Stab it!\" \n\n \"I have seen your dreams, Ronald Weasley, and I have seen your fears. All you \ndesire is possible, but all that you dread is also possible....\" \n\n \"Stab!\" shouted Harry, his voice echoed off the surrounding trees, the sword point \ntrembled, and Ron gazed down into Riddle's eyes. \n\n \"Least loved, always, by the mother who craved a daughter . . . Least loved, now, \nby the girl who prefers your friend . . . Second best, always, eternally overshadowed . . .\" \n\n\"Ron, stab it now!\" Harry bellowed: He could feel the locket quivering in the grip and \nwas scared of what was coming. Ron raised the sword still higher, and as he did so, \nRiddle's eyes gleamed scarlet. \n\n \nOut of the locket's two windows, out of the eyes, there bloomed like two grotesque \nbubbles, the heads of Harry and Hermione, weirdly distorted. \n\n \n\nRon yelled in shock and backed away as the figures blossomed out of the locket, first \nchests, then waists, then legs, until they stood in the locket, side by side like trees with a \ncommon root, swaying over Ron and the real Harry, who had snatched his fingers away \nfrom the locket as it burned, suddenly, white-hot. \n\n \n\n\"Ron!\" he shouted, but the Riddle-Harry was now speaking with Voldemort's voice and \nRon was gazing, mesmerized, into its face. \n\n \n\n\"Why return? We were better without you, happier without you, glad of your absence.... \nWe laughed at your stupidity, your cowardice, your presumption--\" \n\n \n\n\"Presumption!\" echoed the Riddle-Hermione, who was more beautiful and yet more \nterrible than the real Hermione: She swayed, cackling, before Ron, who looked horrified, \nyet transfixed, the sword hanging pointlessly at his side. \"Who could look at you, who \nwould ever look at you, beside Harry Potter? What have you ever done, compared with \nthe Chosen One? What are you, compared with the Boy Who Lived?\" \n\n \n\n\"Ron, stab it, STAB IT!\" Harry yelled, but Ron did not move. His eyes were wide, and \nthe Riddle-Harry and the Riddle-Hermione were reflected in them, their hair swirling like \nflames, their eyes shining red, their voices lifted in an evil duet. \n\n \n\n\"Your mother confessed,\" sneered Riddle-Harry, while Riddle-Hermione jeered, \"that she \nwould have preferred me as a son, would be glad to exchange...\" \n\n \n\n\"Who wouldn't prefer him, what woman would take you, you are nothing, nothing, \nnothing to him,\" crooned Riddle-Hermione, and she stretched like a snake and entwined \nherself around Riddle-Harry, wrapping him in a close embrace: Their lips met. \n\n \nOn the ground in front of them, Ron's face filled with anguish. he raised the sword high, \nhis arms shaking. \n\n\f\n \"Do it, Ron!\" Harry yelled. \n\n \nRon looked toward him, and Harry thought he saw a trace of scarlet in his eyes. \n\n \n\"Ron --?\" \n\n \n\nThe sword flashed, plunged: Harry threw himself out of the way, there as a clang of metal \nand a long, drawn-out scream. Harry whirled around, slipping in the snow, wand held \nready to defend himself, but there was nothing to fight. \n\n \n\nThe monstrous versions of himself and Hermione were gone: There was only Ron, \nstanding there with the sword held slackly in his hand, looking down at the shattered \nremains of the locket on the flat rock. \n\n \n\nSlowly, Harry walked back to him, hardly knowing what to say or do. Ron was breathing \nheavily: His eyes were no longer red at all, but their normal blue: they were also wet. \n\n \nHarry stooped, pretending he had not seen, and picked up the broken Horcrux. Ron had \npierced the glass in both windows: Riddle's eyes were gone, and the stained silk lining of \nthe locket was smoking slightly. The thing that had lived in the Horcrux had vanished; \ntorturing Ron had been its final act. The sword clanged as Ron dropped it. He had sunk to \nhis knees, his head in his arms. He was shaking, but not, Harry realized, from cold. Harry \ncrammed the broken locket into his pocket, knelt down beside Ron, and placed a hand \ncautiously on his shoulder. He took it as a good sign that Ron did not throw it off. \n\n \n\n\"After you left,\" he said in a low voice, grateful for the fact that Ron's face was hidden, \n\"she cried for a week. Probably longer, only she didn't want me to see. There were loads \nof nights when we never even spoke to each other. With you gone...\" \n\n \n\nHe could not finish; it was now that Ron was here again that Harry fully realized how \nmuch his absence had cost them. \n\n \n\n\"She's like my sister,\" he went on. \"I love her like a sister and I reckon that she feels the \nsame way about me. It's always been like that. I thought you knew.\" \n\n \n\nRon did not respond, but turned his face away from Harry and wiped his nose noisily on \nhis sleeve. Harry got to his feet again and walked to where Ron's enormous rucksack lay \nyards away, discarded as Ron had run toward the pool to save Harry from drowning. He \nhoisted it onto his own back and walked back to Ron, who clambered to his feet as Harry \napproached, eyes bloodshot but otherwise composed. \n\n \n\n\"I'm sorry,\" he said in a thick voice. \"I'm sorry I left. I know I was a -- a --\" \n\n \n\nHe looked around at the darkness, as if hoping a bad enough word would swoop down \nupon him and claim him. \n\n\f\n \n\n\"You've sort of made up for it tonight,\" said Harry. \"Getting the sword. Finishing off the \nHorcrux. Saving my life.\" \n\n \n\n\"That makes me sound a lot cooler than I was,\" Ron mumbled. \n\n \n\n\"Stuff like that always sounds cooler than it really was\" said Harry. \"I've been trying to \ntell you that for years.\" \n\n \n\nSimultaneously they walked forward and hugged, Harry gripping the still-sopping back \nof Ron's jacket. \n\n \n\n\"And now,\" said Harry as they broke apart, \"all we've got to do is find that tent again.\" \n\n \n\nBut it was not difficult. Though the walk through the dark forest with the doe had seemed \nlengthy, with Ron by his side, the journey back seemed to take a surprisingly short time. \nHarry could not wait to wake Hermione, and it was with quickening excitement that he \nentered the tent, Ron lagging a little behind him. \n\n \n\nIt was gloriously warm after the pool and the forest, the only illumination the bluebell \nflames still shimmering in a bowl on the floor. Hermione was fast asleep, curled up under \nher blankets, and did not move until Harry had said her name several times. \n\n \n\n\"Hermione!\" \n\n \n\nShe stirred, then sat up quickly, pushing her hair out of her face. \n\n \n\"What's wrong? Harry? Are you all right?\" \n\n \n\n\"It's okay, everything's fine. More than fine, I'm great. There's someone here.\" \n\n \n\n\"What do you mean? Who --?\" \n\n \n\nShe saw Ron, who stood there holding the sword and dripping onto the threadbare carpet. \nHarry backed into a shadowy corner, slipped off Ron's rucksack, and attempted to blend \nin with the canvas. \n\n \n\nHermione slid out of her bunk and moved like a sleepwalker toward Ron, her eyes upon \nhis pale face. She stopped right in front of him, her lips slightly parted, her eyes wide. \nRon gave a weak hopeful smile and half raised his arms. \n\n \n\nHermione launched herself forward and started punching every inch of him that she could \nreach. \n\n \n\n\"Ouch -- ow -- gerroff! What the --? Hermione -- OW!\" \n\n \n\n\f\n\"You -- complete -- arse -- Ronald -- Weasley!\" \n\n \n\nShe punctuated every word with a blow: Ron backed away, shielding his head as \nHermione advanced. \n\n \n\n\"You -- crawl -- back -- here -- after -- weeks -- and -- weeks -- oh, where's my wand?\" \n\n \n\nShe looked as though ready to wrestle it out of Harry's hands and he reacted instinctively. \n\n \n\n\"Protego!\" \n\n \n\nThe invisible shield erupted between Ron and Hermione. The force of it knocked her \nbackward onto the floor. Spitting hair out of her mouth, she lept up again. \n\n \n\"Hermione!\" said Harry. \"Calm --\" \n\n \n\n\"I will not calm down!\" she screamed. Never before had he seen her lose control like this; \nshe looked quite demented. \"Give me back my wand! Give it back to me!\" \n\n \n\n\"Hermione, will you please --\" \n\n \n\n\"Don't you tell me what do, Harry Potter!\" she screeched. \"Don't you dare! Give it back \nnow! And YOU!\" \n\n \n\nShe was pointing at Ron in dire accusation: It was like a malediction, and Harry could not \nblame Ron for retreating several steps. \n\n \n\n\"I cam running after you! I called you! I begged you to come back\" \n\"I know,\" Ron said, \"Hermione, I'm sorry, I'm really --\" \n\n \n\n\"Oh, you're sorry!\" \n\n \n\nShe laughed a high-pitched, out-of-control sound; Ron looked at Harry for help, but \nHarry merely grimaced his helplessness. \n\n \n\n\"You came back after weeks -- weeks -- and you think it's all going to be all right if you \njust say sorry?\" \n\n \n\n\"Well, what else can I say?\" Ron shouted, and Harry was glad that Ron was fighting back. \n\n \n\n\"Oh, I don't know!\" yelled Hermione with awful sarcasm. \"Rack your brains, Ron, that \nshould only take a couple of seconds --\" \n\n \n\n\"Hermione,\" interjected Harry, who considered this a low blow, \"he just saved my --\" \n\n \n\n\f\n\"I don't care!\" she screamed. \"I don't care what he's done! Weeks and weeks, we could \nhave been dead for all he knew --\" \n\n \n\n\"I knew you weren't dead!\" bellowed Ron, drowning her voice for the first time, and \napproaching as close as he could with the Shield Charm between them. \"Harry's all over \nthe Prophet, all over the radio, they're looking for you everywhere, all these rumors and \nmental stories, I knew I'd hear straight off if you were dead, you don't know what it's \nbeen like --\" \n\n \n\n\"What it's been like for you?? \n\n \n\nHer voice was not so shrill only bats would be able to hear it soon, but she had reached a \nlevel of indignation that rendered her temporarily speechless, and Ron seized his \nopportunity. \n\n \n\n\"I wanted to come back the minute I'd Disapparated, but I walked straight into a gang of \nSnatchers, Hermione, and I couldn't go anywhere!\" \n\"A gang of what?\" asked Harry, as Hermione threw herself down into a chair with her \narms and legs crossed so tightly it seemed unlikely that she would unravel them for \nseveral years. \n\n \n\n\"Snatchers,\" said Ron. \"They're everywhere -- gangs trying to earn gold by rounding up \nMuggle-borns and blood traitors, there's a reward from the Ministry for everyone \ncaptured. I was on my own and I look like I might be school age; they got really excited, \nthought I was a Muggle-born in hiding. I had to talk fast to get out of being dragged to \nthe Ministry.\" \n\n \n\n\"What did you say to them?\" \n\"Told them I was Stan Shunpike. First person I could think of.\" \n\"And they believed that?\" \n\"They weren't the brightest. One of them was definitely part troll, the smell of him....\" \n\n \n\nRon glanced at Hermione, clearly hopeful she might soften at this small instance of \nhumor, but her expression remained stony above her tightly knotted limbs. \n\n \n\n\"Anyway, they had a row about whether I was Stan or not. It was a bit pathetic to be \nhonest, but there were still five of them and only one of me, and they'd taken my wand. \nThen two of them got into a fight and while the others were distracted I managed to hit \nthe one holding me in the stomach, grabbed his wand, Disarmed the bloke holding mine, \nand Disapparated. I didn't do it so well. Splinched myself again\" -- Ron held up his right \nhand to show two missing fingernails: Hermione raised her eyebrows coldly -- \"and I \n\n\f\ncame out miles from where you were. By the time I got back to that bit of riverbank \nwhere we'd been ... you were gone.\" \n\n \n\n\"Gosh, what a gripping story,\" Hermione said in the lofty voice she adopted when \nwishing to wound. \"You must have been simply terrified. Meanwhile we went to Godric's \nHollow and, let's think, what happened there, Harry? Oh yes, You-Know-Who's snake \nturned up, it nearly killed both of us, and then You-Know-Who himself arrived and \nmissed us by about a second.\" \n\"What?\" Ron said, gaping from her to Harry, but Hermione ignored him. \n\n \n\"Imagine losing fingernails, Harry! That really puts our sufferings into perspective, \ndoesn't it?\" \n\"Hermione,\" said Harry quietly, \"Ron just saved my life.\" \n\n \n\nShe appeared not to have heard him. \n\n \n\"One thing I would like to know, though,\" she said, fixing her eyes on a spot a foot over \nRon's head. \"How exactly did you find us tonight? That's important. Once we know, we'll \nbe able to make sure we're not visited by anyone else we don't want to see.\" \n\n \n\nRon glared at her, then pulled a small silver object from his jeans pocket. \n\n \n\"This.\" \n\n \n\nShe had to look at Ron to see what he was showing them. \n\n \n\n\"The Deluminator?\" she asked, so surprised she forgot to look cold and fierce. \n\n \n\n\"It doesn't just turn the lights on and off,\" said Ron. \"I don't know how it works or why it \nhappened then and not any other time, because I've been wanting to come back ever since \nI left. But I was listening to the radio really early on Christmas morning and I heard ... I \nheard you.\" \n\n \n\nHe was looking at Hermione. \n\n \n\n\"You heard me on the radio?\" she asked incredulously. \n\n \n\n\"No, I heard you coming out of my pocket. Your voice,\" he held up the Deluminator \nagain, \"came out of this.\" \n\n \n\n\"And what exactly did I say?\" asked Hermione, her tone somewhere between skepticism \nand curiosity. \n\n \n\n\"My name. 'Ron.' And you said ... something about a wand....\" \n\n\f\n \n\nHermione turned a fiery shade of scarlet. Harry remembered: it had been the first time \nWon's name had been said aloud by either of them since the day he had left; Hermione \nhad mentioned it when talking about repairing Harry's wand. \n\n \n\n\"So I took it out,\" Ron went on, looking at the Deluminator, \"and it didn't seem different \nor anything, but I was sure I'd heard you. So I clicked it. And the light went out in my \nroom, but another light appeared right outside the window.\" \n\n \n\nRon raised his empty hand and pointed in front of him, his eyes focused on something \nneither Harry nor Hermione could see. \n\n \n\n\"It was a ball of light, kind of pulsing, and bluish, like that light you get around a Portkey, \nyou know?\" \n\n \n\n\"Yeah,\" said Harry and Hermione together automatically. \n\n \n\n\"I knew this was it,\" said Ron. \"I grabbed my stuff and packed it, then I put on my \nrucksack and went out into the garden. \n\n \n\n\"The little ball of light was hovering there, waiting for me, and when I came out it \nbobbed along a bit and I followed it behind the shed and then it ... well, it went inside \nme.\" \n\n \n\n\"Sorry?\" said Harry, sure he had not heard correctly. \n\n \n\n\"It sort of floated toward me,\" said Ron, illustrating the movement with his free index \nfinger, \"right to my chest, and then -- it just went straight through. It was here,\" he \ntouched a point close to his heard, \"I could feel it, it was hot. And once it was inside me, I \nknew what I was supposed to do. I knew it would take me where I needed to go. So I \nDisapparated and came out on the side of a hill. There was snow everywhere....\" \n\n \n\n\"We were there,\" said Harry. \"We spent two nights there, and the second night I kept \nthinking I could hear someone moving around in the dark and calling out!\" \n\"Yeah, well, that would've been me,\" said Ron. \"Your protective spells work, anyway, \nbecause I couldn't see you and I couldn't hear you. I was sure you were around, though, \nso in the end I got in my sleeping bag and waited for one of you to appear. I thought \nyou'd have to show yourselves when you packed up the tent.\" \n\n \n\n\"No, actually,\" said Hermione. \"We've been Disapparating under the Invisibility Cloak as \nan extra precaution. And we left really early, because as Harry says, we'd heard \nsomebody blundering around.\" \n\n \n\n\"Well, I stayed on that hill all day,\" said Ron. \"I kept hoping you'd appear. But when it \nstarted to get dark I knew I must have missed you, so I clicked the Deluminator again, the \n\n\f\nblue light came out and went inside me, and I Disapparated and arrived here in these \nwoods. I still couldn't see you, so I just had to hope one of you would show yourselves in \nthe end -- and Harry did. Well, I saw the doe first, obviously.\" \n\n \n\n\"You saw the what?\" said Hermione sharply. \n\n \n\nThey explained what had happened and as the story of the silver doe and the sword in the \npool unfolded, Hermione frowned form one to the other of them, concentrating so hard \nshe forgot to keep her limbs locked together. \n\n \n\"But it must have been a Patronus!\" she said. \"Couldn't you see who was casting it? \nDidn't you see anyone? And it led you to the sword! I can't believe this! Then what \nhappened?\" \n\n \n\nRon explained how he had watched Harry jump into the pool, and had waited for him to \nresurface; how he had realized that something was wrong, dived in, and saved Harry, \nthen returned for the sword. He got as far as the opening of the locket, then hesitated, and \nHarry cut in. \n\n \n\n\"-- and Ron stabbed it with the sword.\" \n\n \n\n\"And ... and it went? Just like that?\" she whispered. \n\n \n\n\"Well, it -- it screamed,\" said Harry with half a glance at Ron. \"Here.\" \n\n \n\nHe threw the locket into her lap; gingerly she picked it up and examined its punctured \nwindows. \n\n \n\nDeciding that it was at last safe to do so, Harry removed the Shield Charm with a wave of \nHermione's wand and turned to Ron. \n\n \n\"Did you just say now that you got away from the snatchers with a spare wand?\" \n\n \n\n\"What?\" said Ron, who had been watching Hermione examining the locket. \"Oh -- oh \nyeah.\" \n\n \n\nHe tugged open a buckle on his rucksack and pulled a short dark wand out of his pocket. \n\"Here, I figured it's always handy to have a backup.\" \n\n \n\n\"You were right,\" said Harry, holding out his hand. \"Mine's broken.\" \n\n \n\n\"You're kidding?\" Ron said, but at that moment Hermione got to her feet, and he looked \napprehensive again. \n\n \n\nHermione put the vanquished Horcrux into the beaded bag, then climbed back into her \nbed and settled down without another word. \n\n\f\n \n\nRon passed Harry the new wand. \n\n \n\n\"About the best you could hope for, I think,\" murmured Harry. \n\n \n\n\"Yeah,\" said Ron. \"Could've been worse. Remember those birds she set on me?\" \n\n \n\n\"I still haven't ruled it out,\" came Hermione's muffled voice from beneath her blankets, \nbut Harry saw Ron smiling slightly as he pulled his maroon pajamas out of his rucksack. \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter Twenty \n\nXenophilius Lovegood \n\n \n\nHarry had not expected Hermione's anger to abate over night and was \ntherefore unsurprised that she communicated mainly by dirty looks and \npointed silences the next morning. Ron responded by maintaining an \nunnaturally somber demeanor in her presence as an outward sign of continuing \nremorse. In fact, when all three of them were together Harry felt like the \nonly non-mourner at a poorly attended funeral. During those few moments he \nspent alone with Harry, however (collecting water and searching the \nundergrowth for mushrooms). Ron became shamelessly cheery. \n\"Someone helped us,\" he kept saying, \"Someone sent that doe, Someone's on \nour side, One Horcrux down, mate!\" \nBolstered by the destruction of the locket they set to debating the possible \nlocations of the other Horcruxes and even though they had discussed the \nmatter so often before. Harry felt optimistic, certain that more \nbreakthroughs would succeed the first. Hermione's sulkiness could not mar \nhis buoyant spirits; The sudden upswing in their fortunes, the appearance of \nthe mysterious due, the recovery of Gryffindor\u2019s sword, and above all, Ron's \nreturn made Harry so happy that it was quite difficult to maintain a \nstraight face. \nLate in the afternoon he and Ron escaped Hermione's baleful presence again \nand under the pretense of scouring the bare hedges for nonexistent \nblackberries, they continued their ongoing exchange of news. Harry had \nfinally managed to tell Ron the whole story of his and Hermione's various \nwanderings, right up to the full story of what had happened at Godric's \nHollow; Ron was now filling Harry in on everything he had discovered about \nthe wider Wizarding world during his weeks away. \n\n\n\f\n\"... and how did you find out about the Taboo?\" he asked Harry after \nexplaining the many desperate attempts of Muggle-borns to evade the \nMinistry.\" \n\"The what?\" \n\"You and Hermione have stopped saying You-Know-Who's name!\" \n\"Oh, yeah, Well, it's just a bad habit we've slipped into,\" said Harry. \"But \nI haven't got a problem calling him V ---\" \n\"NO!\" roared Ron, causing Harry to jump into the hedge and Hermione (nose \nburied in a book at the tent entrance) to scowl over at them. \"Sorry,\" said \nRon, wrenching Harry back out of the brambles, \"but the name's been jinxed, \nHarry, that's how they track people! Using his name breaks protective \nenchantments, it causes some kind of magical disturbance --- it's how they \nfound us in Tottenham Court Road!\" \n\"Because we used his *name*?\" \n\"Exactly! You've got to give them credit, it makes sense. It was only people \nwho were serious about standing up to him, like Dumbledore, who even dared \nuse it. Now they've put a Taboo on it, anyone who says it is trackable --- \nquick-and-easy way to find Order members! They nearly got Kingsley ---\" \n\"You're kidding?\" \n\"Yeah, a bunch of Death Eaters cornered him, Bill said but he fought his way \nout. He's on the run now just like us.\" Ron scratched his chin \nthoughtfully with \nthe end of his wand. \"You don't reckon Kingsley could have sent that doe?\" \n\"His Patronus is a lynx, we saw it at the wedding, remember?\" \n\"Oh yeah...\" \nThey moved farther along the hedge, away from the tent and Hermione. \n\"Harry... you don't reckon it could've been Dumbledore?\" \n\"Dumbledore what?\" \nRon looked a little embarrassed, but said in a low voice, \"Dumbledore ... the \ndoe? I mean,\" Ron was watching Harry out of the corners of his eyes, \"he had \nthe real sword last, didn't he? \n\n\n\f\nHarry did not laugh at Ron, because he understood too well the longing \nbehind the question. The idea that Dumbledore had managed to come back to \nthem, that he was watching over them, would have inexpressibly comforting. \nHe shook his head. \n\"Dumbledore\u2019s dead,\" he said. \"I saw it happen, I saw the body. He's \ndefinitely gone. Anyway his Patronus was a phoenix, not a doe\" \n\"Patronuses can change, though can't they?\" said Ron, \"Tonks\u2019s changed \ndidn't it?\" \nYeah, but if Dumbledore was alive, why wouldn't he show himself? Why \nwouldn't he just hand us the sword? \n\"Search me,\" said Ron. \"Same reason he didn't give it to you while he was \nalive? Same reason he left you an old Snitch and Hermione a book of kid's \nstories?\" \n\"Which is what?\" asked Harry, turning to look Ron full in the face desperate \nfor the answer. \n\"I dunno,\" said Ron. \"Sometimes I've thought, when I've been a bit hacked \noff, he was having a laugh or --- or he just wanted to make it more \ndifficult, But I don't think so, not anymore. He knew what he was doing when \nhe gave me the Deluminator, didn't he? He -- well,\" Ron's ears turned bright \nred and he became engrossed in a tuft of grass at his feet, which he prodded \nwith his toe, \"he must've known I'd run out on you.\" \n\"No,\" Harry corrected him. \"He must've known you'd always want to come \nback.\" \nRon looked grateful, but still awkward. Partly to change the subject, Harry \nsaid, \"Speaking of Dumbledore, have you heard what Skeeter wrote about him?\" \n\"Oh yeah,\" said Ron at once, \"people are talking about it quite a lot. \n'Course, if things were different it'd be huge news, Dumbledore being pals \nwith Grindelwald, but now it's just something to laugh about for people who \ndidn't like Dumbledore, and a bit of a slap in the face for everyone who \nthought he was such a good bloke. I don't know that it's such a big deal, \nthough. He was really young when they --\" \n\"Our age,\" said Harry, just as he had retorted to Hermione, and something in \nhis face seemed to decide Ron against pursuing the subject. \nA large spider sat in the middle of a frosted web in the brambles. Harry \ntook aim at it with the wand Ron had given him the previous night, which \n\n\f\nHermione had since condescended to examine, and had decided was made of \nblackthorn. \n\"*Engorgio*\" \n\"The spider gave a little shiver, bouncing slightly in the web. Harry tried \nagain. This time the spider grew slightly larger. \n\"Stop that,\" said Ron sharply, \" I'm sorry I said Dumbledore was young, \nokay?\" \nHarry had forgotten Ron's hatred of spiders. \n\"Sorry --- *Reducio*\" \nThe spider did not shrink. Harry looked down at the blackthorn wand. Every \nminor spell he had cast with it so far that day had seemed less powerful \nthan those he had produced with his phoenix wand. The new one felt \nintrusively unfamiliar, like having somebody else's hand sewn to the end of \nhis arm. \n\"You just need to practice,\" said Hermione, who had approached them \nnoiselessly from behind and had stood watching anxiously as Harry tried to \nenlarge and reduce the spider. \"It\u2019s all a matter of confidence Harry.\" \nHe knew why she wanted it to be all right; She still felt guilty about \nbreaking his wand. He bit back the retort that sprung to his lips, that she \ncould take the blackthorn wand if she thought it made no difference, and he \nwould have hers instead. Keen for them all to be friends again, however, he \nagreed; but when Ron gave Hermione a tentative smile, she stalked off and \nvanished behind her book once more. \nAll three of them returned to the tent when darkness fell, and Harry took \nfirst watch. Sitting in the entrance, he tried to make the blackthorn wand \nlevitate small stones at his feet; but his magic still seemed clumsier and \nless powerful than it had done before. Hermione was lying on her bunk \nreading, while Ron, after many nervous glances up at her, had taken a small \nwooden wireless out of his rucksack and started to try to tune it. \n\"There's this one program,\" he told Harry in a low voice, \"that tells the \nnews like it really is. All the others are on You-Know-Who's side and are \nfollowing the Ministry line, but this one ... you wait till you hear it, it's \ngreat. Only they can't do it every night, they have to keep changing \nlocations in case they're raided and you need a password to tune in ... \nTrouble is, I missed the last one...\" \n\n\n\f\nHe drummed lightly on the top of the radio with his wand muttering random \nwords under his breath. He threw Hermione many covert glances, plainly \nfearing an angry outburst, but for all the notice she took of him he might \nnot have been there. For ten minutes or so Ron tapped and muttered, Hermione \nturned the pages of her book, and Harry continued to practice with the \nblackthorn wand. \nFinally Hermione climbed down from her bunk. Ron ceased his tapping at once. \n\"If it's annoying you, I'll stop!\" he told Hermione nervously. \nHermione did not deign to respond, but approached Harry. \n\"We need to talk,\" she said. \nHe looked at the book still clutched in her hand. It was * The Life and Lies \nof Albus Dumbledore.* \n\"What?\" he said apprehensively. It flew through his mind that there was a \nchapter on him in there; he was not sure he felt up to hearing Rita's \nversion of his relationship with Dumbledore. Hermione's answer however, was \ncompletely unexpected. \n\"I want to go and see Xenophilius Lovegood.\" \nHe stared at her. \n\"Sorry?\" \n\n \n\n\u201cXenophilius Lovegood, Luna\u2019s father. I want to go and talk to him!\u201d \n\n\u201cer \u2013 why?\u201d \n\nShe took a deep breath, as though bracing herself, and said, \u201cIt\u2019s that mark, the \nmark in Beedle the Bard. Look at this!\u201d \n\nShe thrust The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore under Harry\u2019s unwilling eyes \nand saw a photograph of the original letter that Dumbledore had written Grindelwald, \nwith Dumbledore\u2019s familiar thin, slanting handwriting. He hated seeing absolute proof \nthat Dumbledore really had written those words, that they had not been Rita\u2019s invention. \n\n\u201cThe signature,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cLook at the signature, Harry!\u201d \n\nHe obeyed. For a moment he had no idea what she was talking about, but, looking \nmore closely with the aid of his lit wand, he saw that Dumbledore had replaced the A of \nAlbus with a tiny version of the same triangular mark inscribed upon The Tales of Beedle \nthe Bard. \n\n\u201cEr \u2013 what are you -- ?\u201d said Ron tentatively, but Hermione quelled him with a \nlook and turned back to Harry. \n\n\u201cIt keeps cropping up, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d she said. \u201cI know Viktor said it was \nGrindelwald\u2019s mark, but it was definitely on that old grave in Godric\u2019s Hollow, and the \n\n\f\ndates on the headstone were long before Grindelwald came along! And now this! Well, \nwe can\u2019t ask Dumbledore or Grindelwald what it means \u2013 I don\u2019t even know whether \nGrindelwald\u2019s still alive \u2013 but we can ask Mr. Lovegood. He was wearing the symbol at \nthe wedding. I\u2019m sure this is important, Harry!\u201d \n\nHarry did not answer immediately. He looked into her intense, eager face and \nthen out into the surrounding darkness, thinking. After a long pause he said, \u201cHermione, \nwe don\u2019t need another Godric\u2019s Hollow. We talked ourselves into going there, and \u2013\u201d \n\n \u201cBut it keeps appearing, Harry! Dumbledore left me The Tales of Beedle the Bard, \nhow do you know we\u2019re not supposed to find out about the sign?\u201d \n\n \u201cHere we go again!\u201d Harry felt slightly exasperated. \u201cWe keep trying to convince \nourselves Dumbledore left us secret signs and clues \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cThe Deluminator turned out to be pretty useful,\u201d piped up Ron. \u201cI think \nHermione\u2019s right, I think we ought to go and see Lovegood.\u201d \n\n Harry threw him a dark look. He was quite sure that Ron\u2019s support of Hermione \nhad little to do with a desire to know the meaning of the triangular rune. \n\n \u201cIt won\u2019t be like Godric\u2019s Hollow,\u201d Ron added, \u201cLovegood\u2019s on your side, Harry, \nThe Quibbler\u2019s been for you all along, it keeps telling everyone they\u2019ve got to help you!\u201d \n\n \u201cI\u2019m sure this is important!\u201d said Hermione earnestly. \n\n \u201cBut don\u2019t you think if it was, Dumbledore would have told me about it before he \ndied?\u201d \n\n \u201cMaybe . . . maybe it\u2019s something you need to find out for yourself,\u201d said \nHermione with a faint air of clutching at straws. \n\n \u201cYeah,\u201d said Ron sycophantically, \u201cthat makes sense.\u201d \n\n \u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t,\u201d snapped Hermione, \u201cbut I still think we ought to talk to Mr. \nLovegood. A symbol that links Dumbledore, Grindelwald, and Godric\u2019s Hollow? Harry, \nI\u2019m sure we ought to know about this!\u201d \n\n \u201cI think we should vote on it,\u201d said Ron. \u201cThose in favor of going to see Love \ngood \u2013\u201d \n\n His hand flew into the air before Hermione\u2019s. Her lips quivered suspiciously as \nshe raised her own. \n\n \u201cOutvoted, Harry, sorry,\u201d said Ron, clapping him on the back. \n\n \u201cFine,\u201d said Harry, half amused, half irritated. \u201cOnly, once we\u2019ve seen Lovegood, \nlet\u2019s try and look for some more Horcruxes, shall we? Where do the Lovegood\u2019s live, \nanyway? Do either of you know? \n\n \u201cYeah, they\u2019re not far from my place,\u201d said Ron. \u201cI dunno exactly where, but \nMum and Dad always point toward the hills whenever they mention them. Shouldn\u2019t be \nhard to find.\u201d \n\n When Hermione had returned to her bunk, Harry lowered his voice. \n\n \u201cYou only agreed to try and get back in her good books.\u201d \n\n \u201cAll\u2019s fair in love and war,\u201d said Ron brightly, \u201cand this is a bit of both. Cheer up, \nit\u2019s the Christmas holidays, Luna\u2019ll be home!\u201d \n\n They had an excellent view of the village of Ottery St. Catchopole from the \nbreezy hillside to which they Disapparated next morning. From their high vantage point \nthe village looked like a collection of toy houses in the great slanting shafts of sunlight \nstretching to earth in the breaks between clouds. They stood for a minute or two looking \ntoward the Burrow, their hands shadowing their eyes, but all they could make out were \n\n\f\nthe high hedges and trees of the orchard, which afforded the crooked little house \nprotection from Muggle eyes. \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s weird, being this near, but not going to visit,\u201d said Ron. \n\n \u201cWell, it\u2019s not like you haven\u2019t just seen them. You were there for Christmas,\u201d \nsaid Hermione coldly. \n\n \u201cI wasn\u2019t at the Burrow!\u201d said Ron with an incredulous laugh. \u201cDo you think I \nwas going to go back there and tell them all I\u2019d walked out on you? Yeah, Fred and \nGeorge would\u2019ve been great about it. And Ginny, she\u2019d have been really understanding.\u201d \n\n \u201cBut where have you been, then?\u201d asked Hermione, surprised. \n\n \u201cBill and Fleur\u2019s new place. Shell cottage. Bill\u2019s always been decent to me. He \u2013 \nhe wasn\u2019t impressed when he heard what I\u2019d done, but he didn\u2019t go on about it. He knew \nI was really sorry. None of the rest of the family know I was there. Bill told Mum he and \nFleur weren\u2019t going home for Christmas because they wanted to spend it alone. You \nknow, first holiday after they were married. I don\u2019t think Fleur minded. You know how \nmuch she hates Celestina Warbeck.\u201d \n\n Ron turned his back on the Burrow. \n\n \u201cLet\u2019s try up here,\u201d he said, leading the way over the top of the hill. \n\n They walked for a few hours, Harry, at Hermione\u2019s insistence, hidden beneath the \nInvisibility Cloak. The cluster of low hills appeared to be uninhabited apart from one \nsmall cottage, which seemed deserted. \n\n \u201cDo you think it\u2019s theirs, and they\u2019ve gone away for Christmas?\u201d said Hermione, \npeering through the window at a neat little kitchen with geraniums on the windowsill. \nRon snorted. \n\n \u201cListen, I\u2019ve got a feeling you\u2019d be able to tell who lived there if you looked \nthrough the Lovegoods\u2019 window. Let\u2019s try the next lot of hills.\u201d \n\n So they Disapparated a few miles farther north. \n\n \u201cAha!\u201d shouted Ron, as the wind whipped their hair and clothes. Ron was \npointing upward, toward the top of the hill on which they had appeared, where a most \nstrange-looking house rose vertically against the sky, a great black cylinder with a \nghostly moon hanging behind it in the afternoon sky. \u201cThat\u2019s got to be Luna\u2019s house, \nwho else would live in a place like that? It looks like a giant rook!\u201d \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s nothing like a bird,\u201d said Hermione, frowning at the tower. \n\n \u201cI was talking about a chess rook,\u201d said Ron. \u201cA castle to you.\u201d \n\n Ron\u2019s legs were the longest and he reached the top of the hill first. When Harry \nand Hermione caught up with him, panting and clutching stitches in their sides, they \nfound him grinning broadly. \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s theirs,\u201d said Ron. \u201cLook.\u201d \n\n Three hand-painted signs had been tacked to a broke-down gate. The first read, \n\n THE QUIBBLER. EDITOR, X. LOVEGOOD \n\n \n\nthe second, \n\n PICK YOUR OWN MISTLETOE \n\n \n\nthe third, \n\n KEEP OFF THE DIRIGIBLE PLUMS \n\n \n\n\f\n The gate creaked as they opened it. The zigzagging path leading to the front door \nwas overgrown with a variety of odd plants, including a bush covered in orange \nradishlike fruit Luna sometimes wore as earrings. Harry thought he recognized a \nSnargaluff and gave the wizened stump a wide berth. Two aged crab apple trees, bent \nwith the wind, stripped of leaves but still heavy with berry-sized red fruits and bushy \ncrowns of white beaded mistletoe, stood sentinel on either side of the front door. A little \nowl with a slightly flattened hawklike head peered down at them from one of the \nbranches. \n\n \u201cYou\u2019d better take off the Invisibility Cloak, Harry,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cIt\u2019s you Mr. \nLovegood wants to help, not us.\u201d \n\n He did as she suggested, handing her the Cloak to stow in the beaded bag. She \nthen rapped three times on the thick black door, which was studded with iron nails and \nbore a knocker shaped like an eagle. \n\nBarely ten seconds passed, then the door was flung open and there stood \nXenophilius Lovegood, barefoot and wearing what appeared to be a stained \nnightshirt. His long white candyfloss hair was dirty and unkempt. Xenophilius \nhad been positively dapper at Bill and Fleur's wedding by comparison. \n\"What? What is it? Who are you? What do you want?\" he cried in a \nhigh-pitched, querulous voice, looking first at Hermione, then at Ron, and \nfinally at Harry, upon which his mouth fell open in a perfect, comical O. \n\"Hello, Mr. Lovegood,\" said Harry, holding out his hand, \"I'm Harry, \nHarry Potter.\" \nXenophilius did not take Harry's hand, although the eye that was not \npointing inward at his nose slid straight to the scar on Harry's forehead. \n\"Would it be okay if we came in?\" asked Harry. \"There's something we'd \nlike to ask you.\" \n\"I . . . I'm not sure that's advisable,\" whispered Xenophilius, He \nswallowed and cast a quick look around the garden. \"Rather a shock . . . My \nword . . . I . . . I'm afraid I don't really think I ought to ---\" \n\"It wont take long\" said Harry, slightly disappointed by this \nless-than-warm welcome. \n\"I --- oh, all right then. Come in, quickly, Quickly!\" \nThey were barely over the threshold when Xenophilius slammed the door \nshut behind them, They were standing in the most peculiar kitchen Harry had \never seen. The room was perfectly circular, so that he felt like being \ninside a giant pepper pot. Everything was curved to fit the walls - the \nstove, the sink, and the cupboards - and all of it had been painted with \nflowers, insects, and birds in bright primary colors. Harry thought he \nrecognized Luna's styles. The effect in such and enclosed space, was \nslightly overwhelming. \nIn the middle of the floor, a wrought-iron spiral staircase ld to the \nupper levels. There was a great deal of clattering and banging coming from \noverhead: Harry wondered what Luna could be doing. \n\"You'd better come up.\" said Xenophilius, still looking extremely \nuncomfortable, and he led the way. \nThe room above seemed to be a combination of living room and workplace, \n\n\f\nand as such, was even more cluttered than the kitchen. Though much smaller \nand entirely round, the room somewhat resembled the Room of Requirement on \nthe unforgettable occasion that it had transformed itself into a gigantic \nlabyrinth comprised of centuries of hidden objects. There were piles upon \npiles of books and papers on every surface. Delicately made models of \ncreatures Harry did not recognize, all flapping wings or snapping jaws, hung \nfrom the ceiling. \nLuna was not there: The thing that was making such a racket was a wooden \nobject covered in magically turning cogs and wheels, It looked like the \nbizarre offspring of a workbench and a set of shelves, but after a moment \nHarry deduced that it was an old-fashioned printing press, due to the fact \nthat it was churning out Quibblers. \n\"Excuse me,\" said Xenophilius, and he strode over to the machine, seized \ngrubbily tablecloth from beneath an immense number of books and papers, \nwhich all tumbled onto the floor, and threw it over the press, somewhat \nmuffling the loud bangs and clatters. He then faced Harry. \n\"Why have you come here?\" \nBefore Harry could speak, however, Hermione let out a small cry of shock. \n\"Mr. Lovegood - what's that?\" \nSee was pointing at an enormous, gray spiral horn, not unlike that of a \nunicorn, which had been mounted on the wall, protruding several feet into \nthe room. \n\"It is the horn of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack,\" said Xenophilius. \n\"No it isn't!\" said Hermione. \n\"Hermione,\" muttered Harry, embarrassed, \"now's not the moment -\" \n\"But Harry, it's an Erumpent horn! It's a Class B Tradeable Material and \nit's an extraordinary dangerous thing to have in a house!\" \n\"How'd you know it's an Erumpent horn?\" asked Ron, edging away from the \nhorn as fast as he could, given the extreme clutter of the room. \n\"There's a description in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them! Mr. \nLovegood, you need to get rid of it straightaway, don't you know it can \nexplode at the slightest touch?\" \n\"The Crumple Horned Snorkack\" said Xenophilius very clearly, a mulish \nlook upon his face, \u201cis a shy and highly magical creature, and it's horn -\" \n\"Mr. Lovegood. I recognize the grooved markings around the base, that's \nan Erumpent horn and it's incredibly dangerous - I don't know where you got \nit-\" \n\"I bought it,\" said Xenophilius dogmatically. \"Two weeks ago, from a \ndelightful young wizard who knew my interest in the exquisite Snorkack. A \nChristmas surprise for my Luna. Now,\" he said, turning to Harry, \"why \nexactly have you come here, Mr. Potter?\" \n\"We need some help,\" said Harry, before Hermione could start again. \n\"Ah,\" said Xenophilius, \"Help, Hmm.\" \nHis good eye moved again to Harry's scar. He seemed simultaneously \nterrified and mesmerized. \n\"Yes. The thing is ... helping Harry Potter ... rather dangerous...\" \n\n\f\n \"Aren't you the one who keeps telling everyone it's their first duty to \nhelp Harry?\" said Ron. \"In that magazine of yours?\" \nXenophilius glanced behind him at the concealed printing press, still \nbanging and clattering beneath the tablecloth. \n\"Er - yes, I have expressed that view. however -\" \n\"That's for everyone else to do, not you personally?\" said Ron. \nXenophilius did not answer. He kept swallowing, his eyes darting between \nthe three of them. Harry had the impression that he was undergoing some \npainful internal struggle. \n\"Where's Luna?\" asked Hermione. \"Let's see what she thinks.\" \nXenophilius gulped. He seemed to be steeling himself. Finally he said in \na shaky voice difficult to hear over the noise of the printing press, \"Luna \nis down at the stream, fishing for Freshwater Plimpies. She...she will like \nto see you. I'll go and call her and then - yes, very well. I shall try to \nhelp you.\" \nHe disappeared down the spiral staircase and they heard the front open \nand close. They looked at each other. \n\"Cowardly old wart,\" said Ron. \"Luna's got ten times his guts.\" \n\"He's probably worried about what'll happen to them if the Death Eaters \nfind out I was here\" said Harry. \n\"Well, I agree with Ron, \" said Hermione, \"Awful old hypocrite, telling \neveryone else to help you and trying to worm our of it himself. And for \nheaven's sake keep away from that horn.\" \nHarry crossed to the window on the far side of the room. He could see a \nstream, a thin, glittering ribbon lying far below them at the base of the \nhill. They were very high up; a bird fluttered past the window as he stared \nin the direction of the Burrow, now invisible beyond another line of hills. \nGinny was over there somewhere. They were closer to each other today than \nthey had been since Bill and Fleur's wedding, but she could have no idea he \nwas gazing toward her now, thinking of her. He suppose he ought to be glad \nof it; anyone he came into contact with was in danger, Xenophilius's attitude \nproved that. \nhe turned away from the windows and his gaze fell upon another peculiar \nobject standing upon the cluttered, curved slide board; a stone but of a \nbeautiful but austere-looking witch wearing a most bizarre-looking \nheaddress. Two objects that resembled golden ear trumpets curved out from \nthe sides. A tiny pair of glittering blue wing was stuck to a leather strap \nthat ran over the top of her head, while one of the orange radishes had been \nstuck to a second strap around her forehead. \n\"Look at this,\" said Harry. \n\"Fetching,\" said Ron. \"Surprised he didn't hear that to the wedding.\" \nThey heard the front door close, and a moment later Xenophilius climbed \nback up the spiral staircase into the room, his thin legs now encase in \nWellington boots, bearing a tray of ill-assorted teacups and a steaming \nteapot. \n\"Ah, you have spotted my pet invention,\" he said, shoving the tray into \n\n\f\nHermione's arms and joining Harry at the statue's side. \n\"Modeled, fittingly enough, upon the head of the beautiful Rowens Ravenclaw, \n'Wit beyond measure is a man's greatest treasure!'\" \nHe indicated the objects like ear trumpets. \n\"These are the Wrackpurt siphons - to remove all sources of distraction \nfrom the thinker's immediate area. Here, \"he pointed out the tiny wings, \"a \nbillywig propeller, to induce an elevated frame of mind. Finally, \"he \npointed to the orange radish, \"the dirigible Plum, so as to enhance the \nability to accept the extraordinary.\" \nXenophilius strode back to the tea tray, which Hermione had managed to \nbalance precariously on one of the cluttered side tables. \n\"May I offer you all an infusion of Gurdyroots?\" said Xenophilius. \"We \nmake it ourselves.\" As he started to pour out the drink, which was as deeply \npurple as beetroot juice, he added, \"Luna is down beyond Bottom Bridge, she \nis most excited that you are here She ought not to be too long, she has \ncaught nearly enough Plumpies to make soup for all of us. Do sit down and \nhelp yourselves to sugar. \n\"Now,\" he remove a tottering pile of papers from an armchair and sat \ndown, his Wellingtoned legs crossed, \"how may I help you, Mr. Potter?\" \n\"Well,\" said Harry, glancing at Hermione, who nodded encouragingly, \n\"it's about that symbol you were wearing around your neck at Bill and \nFleur's wedding, Mr. Lovegood. We wondered what it meant.\" \nXenophilius raised his eyebrows. \n\"Are you referring to the sign of the Deathly Hallows?\" \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter Twenty-One \n\nThe Tale of the Three Brothers \n\n \n\nHarry turned to look at Ron and Hermione. Neither of them seemed to have \nunderstood what Xenophilius had said either. \n\n\"The Deathly Hallows?\" \n\n\"That's right,\" said Xenophilius. \"You haven't heard of them? I'm not surprised. \nVery, very few wizards believe. Witness that knuckle-headed young man at your \nbrother's wedding,\" he nodded at Ron, \"who attacked me for sporting the symbol of a \nwell-known Dark wizard! Such ignorance. There is nothing Dark about the Hallows \u2013 at \nleast not in that crude sense. One simply uses the symbol to reveal oneself to other \nbelievers, in the hope that they might help one with the Quest.\" \n\nHe stirred several lumps of sugar into his Gurdyroot infusion and drank some. \n\n\"I'm sorry,\" said Harry, \"I still don't really understand.\" \n\nTo be polite, he took a sip from his cup too, and almost gagged: The stuff was \nquite disgusting, as though someone had liquidized bogey-flavored Every Flavor Beans. \n\n\f\n\"Well, you see, believers seek the Deathly Hallows,\" said Xenophilius, smacking \nhis lips in apparent appreciation of the Gurdyroot infusion. \n\n\"But what are the Deathly Hallows?\" asked Hermione. \n\nXenophilius set aside his empty teacup. \n\n\"I assume that you are familiar with 'The Tale of the Three Brothers'?\" \n\nHarry said, \"No,\" but Ron and Hermione both said, \"Yes.\" Xenophilius nodded \ngravely. \n\n\"Well, well, Mr. Potter, the whole thing starts with 'The Tale of the Three \nBrothers' . . . I have a copy somewhere . . .\" \n\nHe glanced vaguely around the room, at the piles of parchment and books, but \nHermione said, \"I've got a copy, Mr. Lovegood, I've got it right here.\" \n\nAnd she pulled out The Tales of Beedle the Bard from the small, beaded bag. \n\n\"The original?\" inquired Xenophilius sharply, and when she nodded, he said, \n\"Well then, why don't you read it out aloud? Much the best way to make sure we all \nunderstand.\" \n\n\"Er. . . all right,\" said Hermione nervously. She opened the book, and Harry saw \nthat the symbol they were investigating headed the top of the page as she gave a little \ncough, and began to read. \n\n\"'There were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely, winding road \nat twilight \u2013'\" \n\n\"Midnight, our mum always told us,\" said Ron, who had stretched out, arms \nbehind his head, to listen. Hermione shot him a look of annoyance. \n\n\"Sorry, I just think it's a bit spookier if it's midnight!\" said Ron. \n\n\"Yeah, because we really need a bit more fear in our lives,\" said Harry before he \ncould stop himself. Xenophilius did not seem to be paying much attention, but was \nstaring out of the window at the sky. \"Go on, Hermione.\" \n\n\"In time, the brothers reached a river too deep to wade through and too \ndangerous to swim across. However, these brothers were learned in the magical arts, and \nso they simply waved their wands and made a bridge appear across the treacherous \nwater. They were halfway across it when they found their path blocked by a hooded \nfigure. \n\n\"'And Death spoke to them \u2013'\" \n\n\"Sorry,\" interjected Harry, \"but Death spoke to them?\" \n\n\"It's a fairy tale, Harry!\" \n\n\"Right, sorry. Go on.\" \n\n\"'And Death spoke to them. He was angry that he had been cheated out of the \nthree new victims, for travelers usually drowned in the river. But Death was cunning. He \npretended to congratulate the three brothers upon their magic, and said that each had \nearned a prize for having been clever enough to evade him. \n\n\"'So the oldest brother, who was a combative man, asked for a wand more \npowerful than any in existence: a wand that must always win duels for its owner, a wand \nworthy of a wizard who had conquered Death! So Death crossed to an elder tree on the \nbanks of the river, fashioned a wand from a branch that hung there, and gave it to the \noldest brother. \n\n\"'Then the second brother, who was an arrogant man, decided that he wanted to \nhumiliate Death still further, and asked for the power to recall others from Death. So \n\n\f\nDeath picked up a stone from the riverbank and gave it to the second brother, and told \nhim that the stone would have the power to bring back the dead. \n\n\"'And then Death asked the third and youngest brother what he would like. The \nyoungest brother was the humblest and also the wisest of the brothers, and he did not \ntrust Death. So he asked for something that would enable him to go forth from that place \nwithout being followed by Death. And Death, most unwillingly, handed over his own \nCloak of Invisibility.'\" \n\n\"Death's got an Invisibility Cloak?\" Harry interrupted again. \n\n\"So he can sneak up on people,\" said Ron. \"Sometimes he gets bored of running at \nthem, flapping his arms and shrieking . . . sorry, Hermione.\" \n\n\"'Then Death stood aside and allowed the three brothers to continue on their way, \nand they did so talking with wonder of the adventure they had had and admiring Death's \ngifts. \n\n\"'In due course the brothers separated, each for his own destination. \n\n\"'The first brother traveled on for a week more, and reaching a distant village, \nsought out a fellow wizard with whom he had a quarrel. Naturally, with the Elder Wand \nas his weapon, he could not fail to win the duel that followed. Leaving his enemy dead \nupon the floor the oldest brother proceeded to an inn, where he boasted loudly of the \npowerful wand he had snatched from Death himself, and of how it made him invincible. \n\n\"'That very night, another wizard crept upon the oldest brother as he lay, wine-\nsodden upon his bed. The thief took the wand and for good measure, slit the oldest \nbrother's throat. \n\n\"'And so Death took the first brother for his own. \n\n\"'Meanwhile, the second brother journeyed to his own home, where he lived alone. \nHere he took out the stone that had the power to recall the dead, and turned it thrice in \nhis hand. To his amazement and his delight, the figure of the girl he had once hoped to \nmarry, before her untimely death, appeared at once before him. \n\n\"'Yet she was sad and cold, separated from him as by a veil. Though she had \nreturned to the mortal world, she did not truly belong there and suffered. Finally the \nsecond brother, driven mad with hopeless longing, killed himself so as to truly join her. \n\n\"'And so Death took the second brother from his own. \n\n\"'But though Death searched for the third brother for many years, he was never \nable to find him. It was only when he had attained a great age that the youngest brother \nfinally took off the Cloak of Invisibility and gave it to his son. And the he greeted Death \nas an old friend, and went with him gladly, and, equals, they departed this life.'\" \n\nHermione closed the book. It was a moment or two before Xenophilius seemed to \nrealize that she had stopped reading; then he withdrew his gaze from the window and \nsaid: \"Well, there you are.\" \n\n\"Sorry?\" said Hermione, sounding confused. \n\n\"Those are the Deathly Hallows,\" said Xenophilius. \n\nHe picked up a quill from a packed table at his elbow, and pulled a torn piece of \nparchment from between more books. \n\n\"The Elder Wand,\" he said, and drew a straight vertical line upon the parchment. \n\"The Resurrection Stone,\" he said, and added a circle on top of the line. \"The Cloak of \nInvisibility,\" he finished, enclosing both line and circle in a triangle, to make the symbols \nthat so intrigued Hermione. \"Together,\" he said, \"the Deathly Hallows.\" \n\n\f\n\"But there's no mention of the words 'Deathly Hallows' in the story,\" said \nHermione. \n\n\"Well, of course not,\" said Xenophilius, maddeningly smug. \"That is a children's \ntale, told to amuse rather than to instruct. Those of us who understand these matters, \nhowever, recognize that the ancient story refers to three objects, or Hallows, which, if \nunited, will make the possessor master of Death.\" \n\nThere was a short silence in which Xenophilius glanced out of the window. \nAlready the sun was low in the sky. \n\n\"Luna ought to have enough Plimpies soon,\" he said quietly. \n\n\"When you say 'master of Death' \u2013\"said Ron. \n\n\"Master,\" said Xenophilius, waving an airy hand. \"Conqueror. Vanquisher. \nWhichever term you prefer.\" \n\n\"But then . . . do you mean . . .\" said Hermione slowly, and Harry could tell that \nshe was trying to keep any trace of skepticism out of her voice, \"that you believe these \nobjects \u2013 these Hallows \u2013 really exist?\" \n\nXenophilius raised his eyebrows again. \n\n\"Well, of course.\" \n\n\"But,\" said Hermione, and Harry could hear her restraint starting to crack, \"Mr. \nLovegood, how can you possibly believe \u2013 ?\" \n\n\"Luna has told me all about you, young lady,\" said Xenophilius. \"You are, I \ngather, not unintelligent, but painfully limited. Narrow. Close-minded.\" \n\n\"Perhaps you ought to try on the hat, Hermione,\" said Ron, nodding toward the \nludicrous headdress. His voice shook with the strain of not laughing. \n\n\"Mr. Lovegood,\" Hermione began again, \"We all know that there are such things \nas Invisibility Cloaks. They are rare, but they exist. But \u2013\" \n\n\"Ah, but the Third Hallow is a true Cloak of Invisibility, Miss Granger! I mean to \nsay, it is not a traveling cloak imbued with a Disillusionment Charm, or carrying a \nBedazzling Hex, or else woven from Demiguise hair, which will hide one initially but \nfade with the years until it turns opaque. We are talking about a cloak that really and truly \nrenders the wearer completely invisible, and endures eternally, giving constant and \nimpenetrable concealment, no matter what spells are cast at it. How many cloaks have \nyou ever seen like that, Miss Granger?\" \n\nHermione opened her mouth to answer, then closed it again, looking more \nconfused than ever. She, Harry and Ron glanced at one another, and Harry knew that they \nwere all thinking the same thing. It so happened that a cloak exactly like the one \nXenophilius had just described was in the room with them at that very moment. \n\n\"Exactly,\" said Xenophilius, as if he had defeated them all in reasoned argument. \n\"None of you have ever seen such a thing. The possessor would be immeasurably rich, \nwould he not?\" \n\nHe glanced out of the window again. The sky was now tinged with the faintest \ntrace of pink. \n\n\"All right,\" said Hermione, disconcerted. \"Say the Cloak existed. . . what about \nthat stone, Mr. Lovegood? The thing you call the Resurrection Stone?\" \n\n\"What of it?\" \n\n\"Well, how can that be real?\" \n\n\"Prove that is not,\" said Xenophilius. \n\n\f\nHermione looked outraged. \n\n\"But that's \u2013 I'm sorry, but that's completely ridiculous! How can I possibly prove \nit doesn't exist? Do you expect me to get hold of \u2013 of all the pebbles in the world and test \nthem? I mean, you could claim that anything's real if the only basis for believing in it is \nthat nobody's proved it doesn't exist!\" \n\n\"Yes, you could,\" said Xenophilius. \"I am glad to see that you are opening your \nmind a little.\" \n\n\"So the Elder Wand,\" said Harry quickly, before Hermione could retort, \"you \nthink that exists too?\" \n\n\"Oh, well, in that case there is endless evidence,\" said Xenophilius. \"The Elder \nWand is the Hallow that is most easily traced, because of the way in which it passes from \nhand to hand.\" \n\n\"Which is what?\" asked Harry. \n\n\"Which is that the possessor of the wand must capture it from its previous owner, \nif he is to be truly master of it,\" said Xenophilius. \"Surely you have heard of the way the \nwand came to Egbert the Egregious, after his slaughter of Emeric the Evil? Of how \nGodelot died in his own cellar after his son, Hereward, took the wand from him? Of the \ndreadful Loxias, who took the wand from Baraabas Deverill, whom he had killed? The \nbloody trail of the Elder Wand is splattered across the pages of Wizarding history.\" \n\nHarry glanced at Hermione. She was frowning at Xenophilius, but she did not \ncontradict him. \n\n\"So where do you think the Elder Wand is now?\" asked Ron. \n\n\"Alas, who knows?\" said Xenophilius, as he gazed out of the window. \"Who \nknows where the Elder Wand lies hidden? The trail goes cold with Arcus and Livius. \nWho can say which of them really defeated Loxias, and which took the wand? And who \ncan say who may have defeated them? History, alas, does not tell us.\" \n\nThere was a pause. Finally Hermione asked stiffly, \"Mr. Lovegood, does the \nPeverell family have anything to do with the Deathly Hallows?\" \n\nXenophilius looked taken aback as something shifted in Harry's memory, but he \ncould not locate it. Peverell. . . he had heard that name before. . . \n\n\"But you have been misleading me, young woman!\" said Xenophilius, now sitting \nup much straighter in his chair and goggling at Hermione. \"I thought you were new to the \nHallows Quest! Many of us Questers believe that the Peverells have everything \u2013 \neverything! \u2013 to do with the Hallows!\" \n\n\"Who are the Peverells?\" asked Ron. \n\n\"That was the name on the grave with the mark on it, in Godric's Hollow,\" said \nHermione, still watching Xenophilius. \"Ignotus Peverell.\" \n\n\"Exactly!\" said Xenophilius, his forefinger raised pedantically. \"The sign of the \nDeath Hallows on Ignotus's grave is conclusive proof!\" \n\n\"Of what?\" asked Ron. \n\n\"Why, that the three brothers in the story were actually the three Peverell brothers, \nAntioch, Cadmus and Ignotus! That they were the original owners of the Hallows!\" \n\nWith another glance at the window he got to his feet, picked up the tray, and \nheaded for the spiral staircase. \n\n\"You will stay for dinner?\" he called, as he vanished downstairs again. \n\"Everybody always requests our recipe for Freshwater Plimply soup.\" \n\n\f\n\"Probably to show the Poisoning Department at St. Mungo's,\" said Ron under his \nbreath. \n\nHarry waited until they could hear Xenophilius moving about in the kitchen \ndownstairs before speaking. \n\n\"What do you think?\" he asked Hermione. \n\n\"Oh, Harry,\" she said wearily, \"it's a pile of utter rubbish. This can't be what the \nsign really means. This must just be his weird take on it. What a waste of time.\" \n\n\"I s'pose this is the man who brought us Crumple-Horned Snorkacks,\" said Ron. \n\n\"You didn't believe it either?\" Harry asked him. \n\n\"Nah, that story's just one of those things you tell kids to teach them lessons, isn't \nit? 'Don't go looking for trouble, don't go pick fights, don't go messing around with stuff \nthat's best left alone! Just keep your head down, mind your own business, and you'll be \nokay. Come to think of it,\" Ron added, \"maybe that story's why elder wands are supposed \nto be unlucky.\" \n\n\"What are you talking about?\" \n\n\"One of those superstitions, isn't it? 'May-born witches will marry Muggles.' 'Jinx \nby twilight, undone by midnight.' 'Wand of cider, never prosper.' You must have heard \nthem. My mum's full of them.\" \n\n\"Harry and I were raised by Muggles,\" Hermione reminded him. \"We were taught \ndifferent superstitions.\" She sighed deeply as a rather pungent smell drifted up from the \nkitchen. The one good thing about her exasperation with Xenophilius was that it seemed \nto have made her forget that she was annoyed at Ron. \"I think you're right,\" she told him. \n\"It's just a morality tale, it's obvious which gift is best, which one you'd choose \u2013\" \n\nThe three of them spoke at the same time: Hermione said, \"the Cloak,\" Ron said, \n\"the wand,\" and Harry said, \"the stone.\" \n\nThey looked at each other, half surprised, half amused. \n\n\"You're supposed to say the Cloak,\" Ron told Hermione, \"but you wouldn't need \nto be invisible if you had the wand. An unbeatable wand, Hermione, come on!\" \n\n \n\"We've already got an Invisibility Cloak,\" said Harry, \"And it's helped us rather a lot, in \ncase you hadn't noticed!\" said Hermione. \"Whereas the wand would be bound to attract \ntrouble--\" \n\"Only if you shouted about it,\" argued Ron. \"Only if you were prat enough to go dancing \naround waving it over your head, and singing, 'I've got an unbeatable want, come and \nhave a go if you think you're hard enough.' As long as you kept your trap shut --\" \n-Yes, but could you keep your trap shut?\" said Hermione, looking skeptical. \"You know \nthe only true thing he said to us was that there have been stories about extra-powerful \nwands for hundreds of years.\" \n\"There have?\" asked Harry. \nHermione looked exasperated: The expression was so endearingly familiar that Harry and \nRon grinned at each other. \n\"The Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny, they crop up under different names through the \ncenturies, usually in the possession of some Dark wizard who\u2019s boasting about them. \nProfessor Binns mentioned some of them, but -- oh it's all nonsense. Wands are only as \npowerful as the wizards who use them. Some wizards just like to boast that theirs are \nbigger and better than other people's\" \n\n\f\n\"But how do you know,\" said Harry, \"that those wants -- the Deathstick, and the Wand of \nDestiny -- aren't the same want, surfacing over the centuries under different names?\" \n\"What if they're all really the Elder Wand, made by Death?\" said Ron. \nHarry laughed: The strange idea that had occurred to him was after all, ridiculous. His \nwand, he reminded himself, had been of holly, not elder, and it had been made by \nOllivander, whatever it had done that night Voldemort had pursued him across the skies \nand if it had been unbeatable, how could it have been broken? \n\"So why would you take the stone?\" Ron asked him. \n\"Well, if you could bring people back, we could have Sirius...Mad-\nEye...Dumbledore...my parents...\" \nNeither Ron nor Hermione smiled. \n\"But according to Beedle the Bard, they wouldn't want to come back, would they?\" said \nHarry, thinking about the tail they had just heard. \"I don't suppose there have been loads \nof other stories about a stone that can raise the dead, have there?: he asked Hermione. \n\"No,\" she replied sadly. \"I don't think anyone except Mr. Lovegood could kid themselves \nthat's possible. Beedle probably took the idea from the Sorcerer's Stone; you know, \ninstead of a stone to make you immortal, a stone to reverse death.\" \nThe smell from the kitchen was getting stronger. It was something like burning \nunderpants. Harry wondered whether it would be possible to eat enough of whatever \nXenophilius was cooking to spare his feelings. \n\"What about the Cloak, though?\" said Ron slowly. \"Don't you realize, he's right? I've got \nso used to Harry's Cloak and how good it is, I never stopped to think. I've never heard of \none like Harry's. It's infallible. We've never been spotted under it --\" \n\"Of course not -- we're invisible when we're under it, Ron!\" \n\"But all the stuff he said about other cloaks, and they're not exactly ten a Knut, you know, \nis true! It's never occurred to me before but I've heard stuff about charms wearing off \ncloaks when they get old, or them being ripped apart by spells so they've got holes, \nHarry's was owned by his dad, so it's not exactly new, is it, but it's just ... perfect!\" \n\"Yes, all right, but Ron, the stone...\" \nAs they argued in whispers, Harry moved around the room, only half listening. Reaching \nthe spiral stair, he raised his eyes absently to the next level and was distracted at once. \nHis own face was looking back at him from the ceiling of the room above. After a \nmoment's bewilderment, he realized that it was not a mirror, but a painting. Curious, he \nbegan to clime the stairs. \n\"Harry, what are you doing? I don't think you should look around when he's not here!\" \nBut Harry had already reached the next level. Luna had decorated her bedroom ceiling \nwith five beautifully painted faces: Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Neville. They \nwere not moving as the portraits at Hogwarts moved, but there was a certain magic about \nthem all the same. Harry thought they breathed. What appeared to be a fine golden chains \nwove around the pictures linking them together, but after examining them for a minute or \nso, Harry realized that the chains were actually one work repeated a thousand times in \ngolden ink: friends... friends... friends... \nHarry felt a great rush of affection for Luna. He looked around the room. There was a \nlarge photograph beside the bed, of a young Luna and a woman who looked very like her. \nThey were hugging. Luna looked rather better-groomed in this picture than Harry had \never seen her in life. The picture was dusty. This struck Harry as slightly odd. He stared \n\n\f\naround. Something was wrong. The pale blue carpet was also thick with dust. There were \nno clothes in the wardrobe, whose doors stood ajar. The bed had a cold, unfriendly look, \nas though it had not been slept in for weeks. A single cobweb stretched over the nearest \nwindow across the blood red sky. \n\"What's wrong?\" Hermione asked as Harry descended the staircase, but before he could \nrespond, Xenophilius reached the top of the stairs from the kitchen, now holding a tray \nladen with bowls. \n\"Mr. Lovegood,\" said Harry. \"Where's Luna?\" \n\"Excuse me?\" \n\"Where's Luna?\" \nXenophilius halted on the top step. \n\"I -- I've already told you. She is down at the Botions Bridge fishing for Plimpies.\" \n\"So why have you only laid that tray for four?\" \nXenophilius tried to speak, but no sound came out. The only noise was the continued \nchugging of the printing press, and a slight rattle from the tray as Xenophilius's hands \nshook. \n\"I don't think Luna's been here for weeks.\" said Harry. \"Her clothes are gone, her bed \nhasn't been slept in. Where is she? and why do you keep looking out of the window?\" \nXenophilius dropped the tray. The bowls bounced and smashed Harry, Ron, and \nHermione drew their wands. Xenophilius froze his hand about to enter his pocket. At that \nmoment the printing press have a huge bank and numerous Quibblers came streaming \nacross the floor from underneath the tablecloth, the press fell silent at last. Hermione \nstooped down and picked up one of the magazines, her wand still pointing at Mr. \nLovegood. \n\"Harry, look at this\" He strode over to her as quickly as he could through all the clutter. \nThe front of the Quibbler carried his own picture, emblazoned with the words \n\"Undesirable Number One\" and captioned with the reward money. \n\"The Quibbler's going for a new angle, then?: Harry asked coldly, his mind working very \nfast. \"Is that what you were doing when you went into the garden, Mr. Lovegood? \nSending an owl to the Ministry? \nXenophilius licked his lips \n\"They took my Luna,\" he whispered, \"Because of what I've been writing. They took my \nLuna and I don't know where she is, what they've done to her. But they might give her \nback to me if I -- If I--\" \n\"Hand over Harry?\" Hermione finished for him. \n\"No deal.\" said Ron flatly. \"Get out of the way, we're leaving.\" \nXenophilius looked ghastly, a century old, his lips drawn back into a dreadful leer. \n\"They will be here any moment. I must save Luna. I cannot lose Luna. You must not \nleave.\" \nHe spread his arms in front of the staircase, and Harry had a sudden vision of his mother \ndoing the same thing in front of his crib. \n\"Don't make us hurt you,\" Harry said. \"Get out of the way, Mr. Lovegood.\" \n\"HARRY!\" Hermione screamed. \nFigures on broomsticks were flying past the windows. As the three of them looked away \nfrom him. Xenophilius drew his wand. Harry realized their mistake just in time. He \nlaunched himself sideways, shoving Ron and Hermione out of harm's way as \n\n\f\nXenophilius's Stunning Spell soared across the room and hit the Erumpent horn. \nThere was a colossal explosion. The sound of it seemed to blow the room apart. \nFragments of wood and paper and rubble flew in all directions, along with an \nimpenetrable cloud of thick white dust. Harry flew through the air, then crashed to the \nfloor, unable to see as debris rained upon him, his arms over his head. He heard \nHermione's scream, Ron's yell, and a series of sickening metallic thuds which told him \nthat Xenophilius had been blasted off his feet and fallen backward down the spiral stairs. \nHalf buried in rubble, Harry tried to raise himself. He could barely breathe or see for dust. \nHalf of the ceiling had fall in and the end of Luna's bead was hanging through the hole. \nThe bust of Rowena Ravenclaw lay beside him with half its face missing fragments of \ntorn parchment were floating through the air, and most of the printing press lay on its side, \nblocking the top of the staircase to the kitchen. Then another white shape moved close by, \nand Hermione, coated in dust like a second statue, pressed his finger to her lips. \nThe door downstairs crashed open. \n\"Didn't I tell you there was no need to hurry, Travers?\" said a rough voice. \"Didn't I tell \nyou this nutter was just raving as usual?\" There was a bang and a scream of pain from \nXenophilius. \n\"No...no...upstairs...Potter!\" \n\"I told you last week Lovegood, we weren't coming back for anything less than some \nsolid information! Remember last week? When you wanted to swap your daughter for \nthat stupid bleeding headdress? And the week before\" -- Another bang, another squeal -- \n\"When you thought we'd give her back if you offered us proof there are Cumple\" -- Bang \n-- \"Headed\"--bang--\"Snorkacks?\" \n\"No -- no -- I beg of you!\" sobbed Xenophilius. \"It really is Potter, Really!\" \n\"And now it turns out you only called us here to try and blow us up!\" roared the Death \nEater, and there was a volley of bangs interspersed with squeals of agony from \nXenophilius. \n\"The place looks like it's about to fall in, Selwyn,\" said a cool second voice, echoing up \nthe mangled staircase. \"The stairs are completely blocked. Could try clearing it? Might \nbring the place down.\" \n\"You lying piece of filth.\" shouted the wizard named Selwyn. \n\"You have never seen Potter in your life, have you? Thought you'd lure us here to kill us, \ndid you? And you think you'll get your girl back like this?\" \n\"I swear...I swear...Potter's upstairs!\" \n\"Homenum revelio.\" said the voice at the foot of the stairs. Harry heard Hermione gasp, \nand he had the odd sensation something was swooping low over him, immersing his body \nin its shadow. \n\"There's someone up there all right, Selwyn,\" said the second man sharply. \n\"It's Potter, I tell you, it's Potter!\" sobbed Xenophilius. \"Please...please...give me Luna, \njust let me have Luna...\" \n\"You can have your little girl, Lovegood,\" said Selwyn, \"if you get up those stairs and \nbring me down Harry Potter. But if this is a plot, if it's a trick, if you've got an accomplice \nwaiting up there to ambush us, we'll see if we can spare a bit of your daughter for you to \nbury.\" \nXenophilius gave a wail of fear and despair. There were scurryings and scrapings. \nXenophilius was trying to get through the debris on the stairs. \n\n\f\n\"Come on,\" Harry whispered, \"we've got to get out of here.\" \nHe started to dig himself out under cover of all the noise Xenophilius was making on the \nstaircase. Ron was buried the deepest. Harry and Hermione climbed, as quietly as they \ncould, over all the wreckage to where he lay, trying to prise a heavy chest of drawers off \nhis legs. While Xenophilius banging and scraping drew nearer and nearer, Hermione \nmanaged to free Ron with the use of a Hover Charm. \n\"All right.\" breathed Hermione, as the broken printing press blocking the top of the stairs \nbegin to tremble. Xenophilius was feet away from them. She was still white with dust. \n\"Do you trust me Harry?\" \nHarry nodded. \n\"Okay then.\" Hermione whispered. \"give me the invisibility Cloak. Ron, you're going to \nput it on.\" \n\"Me? But Harry --\" \n\"Please, Ron! Harry, hold on tight to my hand, Ron grab my shoulder.\" \nHarry held out his left hand. Ron vanished beneath the Cloak. The printing press blocking \nthe stairs was vibrating. Xenophilius was trying to shift it using a Hover Charm. Harry \ndid not know what Hermione was waiting for. \n\"Hold tight\" she whispered. \"Hold tight...any second...\" \nXenophilius's paper-white face appeared over the top of the sideboard. \n\"Obliviate!\" cried Hermione, pointing her want first into his face then at the floor beneath \nthem. \"Deprimo!\" \nShe had blasted a hole in the sitting room floor. They fell like boulders. Harry still \nholding onto her hand for dear life, there was a scream from below, and he glimpsed two \nmen trying to get out of the way as vast quantities of rubble and broken furniture rained \nall around them from the shattered ceiling. Hermione twisted in midair and thundering of \nthe collapsing house rang in Harry's ears as she dragged him once more into darkness. \n\n \n\nChapter Twenty-Two \n\nThe Deathly Hallows \n\n \n\n Harry fell, panting, onto grass and scrambled up at once. They seemed to have \nlanded in the corner of a field at dusk; Hermione was already running in a circle around \nthem, waving her wand. \n\n \u201cProtego Totalum\u2026Salvio Hexia\u2026\u201d \n\n \u201cThat treacherous old bleeder.\u201d Ron panted, emerging from beneath the \nInvisibility Cloak and throwing it to Harry. \u201cHermione you\u2019re a genius, a total genius. I \ncan\u2019t believe we got out of that.\u201d \n\n \u201cCave Inimicum\u2026Didn\u2019t I say it was an Frumpent horn, didn\u2019t I tell him? And \nnow his house has been blown apart!\u201d \n\n \u201cServes him right,\u201d said Ron, examining his torn jeans and the cuts to his legs, \n\u201cWhat\u2019d you reckon they\u2019ll do to him?\u201d \n\n \u201cOh I hope they don\u2019t kill him!\u201d groaned Hermione, \u201cThat\u2019s why I wanted the \nDeath Eaters to get a glimpse of Harry before we left, so they knew Xenophilius hadn\u2019t \nbeen lying!\u201d \n\n\f\n \u201cWhy hide me though?\u201d asked Ron. \n\n \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be in bed with spattergrolt, Ron! They\u2019ve kidnapped Luna \nbecause her father supported Harry! What would happen to your family if they knew \nyou\u2019re with him?\u201d \n\n \u201cBut what about your mum and dad?\u201d \n\n \u201cThey\u2019re in Australia,\u201d said Hermione, \u201cThey should be all right. They don\u2019t \nknow anything.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a genius,\u201d Ron repeated, looking awed. \n\nYeah, you are, Hermione,\u201d agreed Harry fervently. \u201cI don\u2019t know what we\u2019d do \nwithout you.\u201d \n\nShe beamed, but became solemn at once. \n\n\u201cWhat about Luna?\u201d \n\n\u201cWell, if they\u2019re telling the truth and she\u2019s still Alive ---\u201c began Ron. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t say that, don\u2019t say it!\u201d squealed Hermione. \u201cShe must be alive, she must!\u201d \n\n\u201cThen she\u2019ll be in Azkaban, I expect,\u201d said Ron. \u201cWhether she survives the place, \nthough\u2026Loads don\u2019t\u2026\u201d \n\n\u201cShe will,\u201d said Harry. He could not bear to contemplate the alternative. \u201cShe\u2019s \ntough, Luna, much tougher than you\u2019d think. She\u2019s probably teaching all the inmates \nabout Wrackspurts and Nargles.\u201d \n\n\u201cI hope you\u2019re right,\u201d said Hermione. She passed a hand over her eyes. \u201cI\u2019d feel \nso sorry for Xenophilius if ---\u201c \n\n\u201c---if he hadn\u2019t just tried to sell us to the Death Eaters, yeah,\u201d said Ron. \n\nThey put up the tent and retreated inside it, where Ron made them tea. After their \nnarrow escape, the chilly, musty old place felt like home: safe, familiar, and friendly. \n\n\u201cOh, why did we go there?\u201d groaned Hermione after a few minutes\u2019 silence. \n\u201cHarry, you were right, it was Godric\u2019s Hollow all over again, a complete waste of time! \nThe Deathly Hallows\u2026such rubbish\u2026although actually,\u201d a sudden thought seemed to \nhave struck her, \u201che might have made it all up, mightn\u2019t he? He probably doesn\u2019t believe \nin the Deathly Hallows at all, he just wanted to keep us talking until the Death Eaters \narrived!\u201d \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d said Ron. \u201cIt\u2019s a damn sight harder making stuff up when \nyou\u2019re under stress than you\u2019d think. I found that out when the Snatchers caught me. It \nwas much easier pretending to be Stan, because I knew a bit about him, than inventing a \nwhole new person. Old Lovegood was under loads of pressure, trying to make sure we \nstayed put. I reckon he told us the truth, or what he thinks is the truth, just to keep us \ntalking.\u201d \n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t suppose it matters,\u201d sighed Hermione. \u201cEven if he was being \nhonest, I never heard such a lot of nonsense in all my life.\u201d \n\n\u201cHang on, though,\u201d said Ron. \u201cThe Chamber of Secrets was supposed to be a \nmyth, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d \n\n\u201cBut the Deathly Hallows can\u2019t exist, Ron!\u201d \n\n\u201cYou keep saying that, but one of them can,\u201d said Ron. \u201cHarry\u2019s Invisibility \nCloak ---\u201c \n\n\u201cThe Tale of the Three Brothers\u2019 is a story,\u201d said Hermione firmly. \u201cA story about \nhow humans are frightened of death. If surviving was as simple as hiding under the \nInvisibility Cloak, we\u2019d have everything we need already!\u201d \n\n\f\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. We could do with an unbeatable wand,\u201d said Harry, turning the \nblackthorn wand he so disliked over in his fingers. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing, Harry!\u201d \n\n\u201cYou said there have been loads of wands --- the Deathstick and whatever they \nwere called ---\u201c \n\n\u201cAll right, even if you want to kid yourself the Elder Wand\u2019s real, what about the \nResurrection Stone?\u201d Her fingers sketched quotation marks around the name, and her \ntone dripped sarcasm. \u201cNo magic can raise the dead, and that\u2019s that!\u201d \n\n\u201cWhen my wand connected with You-Know-Who\u2019s, it made my mum and dad \nappear\u2026and Cedric\u2026\u201d \n\n\u201cBut they weren\u2019t really back from the dead, were they?\u201d said Hermione. \u201cThose \nkind of ---of pale imitations aren\u2019t the same as truly bringing someone back to life.\u201d \n\n\u201cBut she, the girl in the tale, didn\u2019t really come back, did she? The story says that \nonce people are dead, they belong with the dead. But the second brother still got to see \nher and talk to her, didn\u2019t he? He even lived with her for a while\u2026\u201d \n\nHe saw concern and something less easily definable in Hermione\u2019s expression. \nThen, as she glanced at Ron, Harry realized that it was fear: He had scared her with his \ntalk of living with dead people. \n\n\u201cSo that Peverell bloke who\u2019s buried in Godric\u2019s Hollow,\u201d he said hastily, trying \nto sound robustly sane, \u201cyou don\u2019t know anything about him, then?\u201d \n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she replied, looking relieved at the change of subject. \u201cI looked him up \nafter I saw the mark on his grave; if he\u2019d been anyone famous or done anything important, \nI\u2019m sure he\u2019d be in one of our books. The only place I\u2019ve managed to find the name \n\u2018Peverell\u2019 Is Nature\u2019s Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. I borrowed it from Kreacher,\u201d \nshe explained as Ron raised his eyebrows. \u201cIt lists the pure-blood families that are now \nextinct in the male line. Apparently the Peverells were one of the earliest families to \nvanish.\u201d \n\n\u201cExtinct in the male line?\u201d repeated Ron. \n\n\u201cIt means the name died out,\u201d said Hermione, \u201ccenturies ago, in the case of the \nPeverells. They could still have descendents, though, they\u2019d just be called something \ndifferent.\u201d \n\nAnd then it came to Harry in one shining piece, the memory that had stirred at the \nsound of the name \u201cPeverell\u201d: a filthy old man brandishing an ugly ring in the face of a \nMinistry official, and he cried aloud, \u201cMarvolo Gaunt!\u201d \n\n\u201cSorry said Ron and Hermione together. \n\n\u201cMarvolo Gaunt! You-Know-Who\u2019s grandfather! In the Pensieve! With \nDumbledore! Marvolo Gaunt said he was descended from the Peverells!\u201d \n\nRon and Hermione looked bewildered. \n\n\u201cThe ring, the ring that became the Horcrux, Marvolo Gaunt said it had the \nPeverell coat of arms on it! I saw him waving it in the bloke from the Ministry\u2019s face, he \nnearly shoved it up his nose!\u201d \n\n\u201cThe Peverell coat of arms?\u201d said Hermione sharply. \u201cCould you see what it \nlooked like?\u201d \n\n\u201cNot really,\u201d said Harry, trying to remember. \u201cThere was nothing fancy on there, \nas far as I could see; maybe a few scratches. I only ever saw it really close up after it had \nbeen cracked open.\u201d \n\n\f\nHarry saw Hermione\u2019s comprehension in the sudden widening of her eyes. Ron \nwas looking from one to the other, astonished. \n\n\u201cBlimey\u2026You reckon it was this sign again? The sign of the Hallows? \n\n\u201cWhy not said Harry excitedly, \u201cMarvolo Gaunt was an ignorant old git who lived \nlike a pig, all he cared about was his ancestry. If that ring had been passed down through \nthe centuries, he might not have known what it really was. There were no books in that \nhouse, and trust me, he wasn\u2019t the type to read fairy tales to his kids. He\u2019d have loved to \nthink the scratches on the stone were a coat of arms, because as far as he was concerned, \nhaving pure blood made you practically royal.\u201d \n\n\u201cYes\u2026and that\u2019s all very interesting,\u201d said Hermione cautiously, \u201cbut Harry, if \nyou\u2019re thinking what I think you\u2019re think ---\u201c \n\n\u201cWell, why not? Why not? said Harry, abandoning caution. \u201cIt was a stone, \nwasn\u2019t it?\u201d He looked at Ron for support. \u201cWhat if it was the Resurrection Stone?\u201d \n\nRon\u2019s mouth fell open. \n\n\u201cBlimey --- but would it still work if Dumbledore broke --- ?\u201d \n\n\u201cWork? Work? Ron, it never worked! There\u2019s no such thing as a Resurrection \nStone!\u201d \n\nHermione leapt to her feet, looking exasperated and angry. Harry you\u2019re trying to \nfit everything into the Hallows story ---\u201c \n\n\u201cFit everything in?\u201d he repeated. \u201cHermione, it fits of its own accord! I know the \nsign of the Deathly Hallows was on that stone! Gaunt said he was descended from the \nPeverells!\u201d \n\n\u201cA minute ago you told us you never saw the mark on the stone properly!\u201d \n\n\u201cWhere\u2019d you reckon the ring is now?\u201d Ron asked Harry. \u201cWhat did Dumbledore \ndo with it after he broke it open?\u201d \n\n\u201cBut Harry\u2019s imagination was racing ahead, far beyond Ron and Hermione\u2019s\u2026 \n\nThree objects, or Hallows, which, if united, will make the possessor master of \nDeath\u2026Master\u2026Conqueror\u2026Vanquisher\u2026The last enemy that shall be destroyed is \ndeath\u2026 \n\nAnd he saw himself, possessor of the Hallows, facing Voldemort, whose \nHorcruxes were no match\u2026Neither can live while the other survives\u2026Was this the \nanswer? Hallows versus Horcruxes? Was there a way after all, to ensure that he was the \none who triumphed? If he were the master of the Deathly Hallows, would he be safe? \n\n\u201cHarry?\u201d \n\nBut he scarcely heard Hermione: He had pulled out his Invisibility Cloak and was \nrunning it through his fingers, the cloth supple as water, light as air. He had never seen \nanything to equal it in his nearly seven years in the Wizarding world. The Cloak was \nexactly what Xenophilius had described: A cloak that really and truly renders the wearer \ncompletely invisible, and endures eternally, giving constant and impenetrable \nconcealment, no matter what spells are cast at it\u2026 \n\nAnd then, with a gasp, he remembered\u2014 \n\n\u201cDumbledore had my Cloak the night my parents died!\u201d \n\nHis voice shook and he could feel the color in his face, but he did not care. \n\n\u201cMy mum told Sirius that Dumbledore borrowed the Cloak! This is why! He \nwanted to examine it, because he thought it was the third Hallow! Ignotus Peverell is \nburied in Godric\u2019s Hollow\u2026\u201d Harry was walking blindly around the tent, feeling as \n\n\f\nthough great new vistas of truth were opening all around him. \u201cHe\u2019s my ancestor. I\u2019m \ndescended from the third brother! It all makes sense!\u201d \n\n\u201cHe felt armed in certainty, in his belief in the Hallows, as if the mere idea of \npossessing them was giving him protection, and he felt joyous as he turned back to the \nother two. \n\n\u201cHarry,\u201d said Hermione again, but he was busy undoing the pouch around his \nneck, his fingers shaking hard. \n\n\u201cRead it,\u201d he told her, pushing his mother\u2019s letter into her hand. \u201cRead it! \nDumbledore had the Cloak, Hermione! Why else would he want it? He didn\u2019t need a \nCloak, he could perform a Disillusionment Charm so powerful that he made himself \ncompletely invisible without one!\u201d \n\nSomething fell to the floor and rolled, glittering, under a chair: He had dislodged \nthe Snitch when he pulled out the letter. He stooped to pick it up, and then the newly \ntapped spring of fabulous discoveries threw him another gift, and shock and wonder \nerupted inside him so that he shouted out. \n\n\u201cIT\u2019S IN HERE! He left me the ring \u2013 it\u2019s in the Snitch!\u201d \n\n\u201cYou --- you reckon?\u201d \n\nHe could not understand why Ron looked taken aback. It was so obvious, so clear \nto Harry. Everything fit, everything\u2026His Cloak was the third Hallow, and when he \ndiscovered how to open the Snitch he would have the second, and then all he needed to \ndo was find the first Hallow, the Elder Wand, and then --- \n\nBut it was as though a curtain fell on a lit stage: All his excitement, all his hope \nand happiness were extinguished at a stroke, and he stood alone in the darkness, and the \nglorious spell was broken. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what he\u2019s after.\u201d \n\nThe change in his voice made Ron and Hermione look even more scared. \n\n\u201cYou-Know-Who\u2019s after the Elder Wand.\u201d \n\nHe turned his back on their strained, incredulous faces. He knew it was the truth. \nIt all made sense, Voldemort was not seeking a new wand; he was seeking an old wand, a \nvery old wand indeed. Harry walked to the entrance of the tent, forgetting about Ron and \nHermione as he looked out into the night, thinking\u2026 \n\nVoldemort had been raised in a Muggle orphanage. Nobody could have told him \nThe Tales of Beedle the Bard when he was a child, any more than Harry had heard them. \nHardly any wizards believed in the Deathly Hallows. Was it likely that Voldemort knew \nabout them? \n\nHarry gazed into the darkness\u2026If Voldemort had known about the Deathly \nHallows, surely he would have sought them, done anything to possess them: three objects \nthat made the possessor master of Death? If he had known about the Deathly Hallows, he \nmight not have needed Horcruxes in the first place. Didn\u2019t the simple fact that he had \ntaken a Hallow, and turned it into a Horcrux, demonstrate that he did not know this last \ngreat Wizarding secret? \n\nWhich meant that Voldemort sought the Elder Wand without realizing its full \npower, without understanding that it was one of three\u2026for the wand was the Hallow that \ncould not be hidden, whose existence was best known\u2026The bloody trail of the Elder \nWand is splattered across the pages of Wizarding history\u2026 \n\n\f\nHarry watched the cloudy sky, curves of smoke-gray and silver sliding over the \nface of the white moon. He felt lightheaded with amazement at his discoveries. \n\nHe turned back into the tent. It was a shock to see Ron and Hermione standing \nexactly where he had left them, Hermione still holding Lily\u2019s letter, Ron at her side \nlooking slightly anxious. Didn\u2019t they realize how far they had traveled in the last few \nminutes? \n\n\u201cThis is it?\u201d Harry said, trying to bring them inside the glow of his own \nastonished certainty, \u201cThis explains everything. The Deathly Hallows are real and I\u2019ve \ngot one --- maybe two ---\u201c \n\nHe held up the Snitch. \n\n\u201c--- and You-Know-Who\u2019s chasing the third, but he doesn\u2019t realize\u2026he just \nthinks it\u2019s a powerful wand ---\u201c \n\n\u201cHarry,\u201d said Hermione, moving across to him and handing him back Lily\u2019s letter, \n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I think you\u2019ve got this wrong, all wrong.\u201d \n\n\u201cBut don\u2019t you see? It all fits ---\u201c \n\n\u201cNot, it doesn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t. Harry, you\u2019re just getting carried away. \nPlease,\u201d she said as she started to speak, \u201cplease just answer me this: If the Deathly \nHallows really existed, and Dumbledore knew about them, knew that the person who \npossessed all of them would be master of Death --- Harry, why wouldn\u2019t he have told \nyou? Why?\u201d \n\nHe had his answer ready. \n\n\u201cBut you said it, Hermione! You\u2019ve got to find out about them for yourself! It\u2019s a \nQuest!\u201d \n\n\u201cBut I only said that to try and persuade you to come to the Lovegoods\u2019!\u201d cried \nHermione in exasperation. \u201cI didn\u2019t really believe it!\u201d \n\nHarry took no notice. \n\n\u201cDumbledore usually let me find out stuff for myself. He let me try my strength, \ntake risks. This feels like the kind of thing he\u2019d do.\u201d \n\n\u201cHarry, this isn\u2019t a game, this isn\u2019t practice! This is the real thing, and \nDumbledore left you very clear instructions: Find and destroy the Horcruxes! That \nsymbol doesn\u2019t mean anything, forget the Deathly Hallows, we can\u2019t afford to get \nsidetracked ---\u201c \n\nHarry was barely listening to her. He was turning the Snitch over and over in his \nhands, half expecting it to break open, to reveal the Resurrection Stone, to prove to \nHermione that he was right, that the Deathly Hallows were real. \n\nShe appealed to Ron. \n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t believe in this, do you?\u201d \n\nHarry looked up, Ron hesitated. \n\n\u201cI dunno\u2026I mean\u2026bits of it sort of fit together,\u201d said Ron awkwardly, \u201cBut \nwhen you look at the whole thing\u2026\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cI think we\u2019re supposed to \nget rid of Horcruxes, Harry. That\u2019s what Dumbledore told us to do. Maybe\u2026maybe we \nshould forget about this Hallows business.\u201d \n\n\u201cThank you, Ron,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cI\u2019ll take first watch.\u201d \n\nAnd she strode past Harry and sat down in the tent entrance bringing the action to \na fierce full stop. \n\n\f\nBut Harry hardly slept that night. The idea of the Deathly Hallows had taken \npossession of him, and he could not rest while agitating thoughts whirled through his \nmind: the wand, the stone, and the Cloak, if he could just possess them all\u2026 \n\nI open at the close\u2026But what was the close? Why couldn\u2019t he have the stone \nnow? If only he had the stone, he could ask Dumbledore these questions in person\u2026and \nHarry murmured words to the Snitch in the darkness, trying everything, even \nParseltongue, but the golden ball would not open\u2026 \n\nAnd the wand, the Elder Wand, where was that hidden? Where was Voldemort \nsearching now? Harry wished his scar would burn and show him Voldemort\u2019s thoughts, \nbecause for the first time ever, he and Voldemort were united in wanting the very same \nthing\u2026Hermione would not like that idea, of course\u2026But then, she did not \nbelieve\u2026.Xenophilius had been right, in a way\u2026Limited, Narrow, Close-minded. The \ntruth was that she was scared of the idea of the Deathly Hallows, especially of the \nResurrection Stone\u2026and Harry pressed his mouth again to the Snitch, kissing it, nearly \nswallowing it, but the cold medal did not yield\u2026 \n\nIt was nearly dawn when he remembered Luna, alone in a cell in Azkaban, \nsurrounded by dementors, and he suddenly felt ashamed of himself. He had forgotten all \nabout her in his feverish contemplation of the Hallows. If only they could rescue her, but \ndementors in those numbers would be virtually unassailable. Now he came to think about \nit, he had not tried casting a Patronus with the blackthorn wand\u2026He must try that in the \nmorning\u2026 \n\nIf only there was a way of getting a better wand\u2026 \n\nAnd desire for the Elder Wand, the Deathstick, unbeatable, invincible, swallowed \nhim once more\u2026 \n\nThey packed up the tent next morning and moved on through a dreary shower of \nrain. The downpour pursued them to the coast, where they pitched the tent that night, and \npersisted through the whole week, through sodden landscapes that Harry found bleak and \ndepressing. He could think only of the Deathly Hallows. It was as though a flame had \nbeen lit inside him that nothing, not Hermione\u2019s flat disbelief nor Ron\u2019s persistent doubts, \ncould extinguish. And yet the fiercer the longing for the Hallows burned inside him, the \nless joyful it made him. He blamed Ron and Hermione: Their determined indifference \nwas as bad as the relentless rain for dampening his spirits, but neither could erode his \ncertainty, which remained absolute. Harry\u2019s belief in and longing for the Hallows \nconsumed him so much that he felt isolated from the other two and their obsession with \nthe Horcruxes. \n\n\u201cObsession?\u201d said Hermione in a low fierce voice, when Harry was careless \nenough to use the word one evening, after Hermione had told him off for his lack of \ninterest in locating more Horcruxes. \u201cWe\u2019re not the one with an obsession, Harry! We\u2019re \nthe ones trying to do what Dumbledore wanted us to do!\u201d \n\nBut he was impervious to the veiled criticism. Dumbledore had left the sign of the \nHallows for Hermione to decipher, and he had also, Harry remained convinced of it, left \nthe Resurrection Stone hidden in the golden Snitch. Neither can live while the other \nsurvives\u2026master of Death\u2026Why didn\u2019t Ron and Hermione understand? \n\n\u201c\u2019The last enemy shall be destroyed is death,\u2019\u201d Harry quoted calmly. \n\n\u201cI thought it was You-Know-Who we were supposed to be fighting?\u201d Hermione \nretorted, and Harry gave up on her. \n\n\f\nEven the mystery of the silver doe, which the other two insisted on discussing, \nseemed less important to Harry now, a vaguely interesting sideshow. The only other thing \nthat mattered to him was that his scar had begun to prickle again, although he did all he \ncould to hide this fact from the other two. He sought solitude whenever it happened, but \nwas disappointed by what he saw. The visions he and Voldemort were sharing had \nchanged in quality; they had become blurred, shifting as though they were moving in and \nout of focus. Harry was just able to make out the indistinct features of an object that \nlooked like a skull, and something like a mountain that was more shadow than substance. \nUsed to images sharp as reality, Harry was disconcerted by the change. He was worried \nthat the connection between himself and Voldemort had been damaged, a connection that \nhe both feared and, whatever he had told Hermione, prized. Somehow Harry connected \nthese unsatisfying, vague images with the destruction of his wand, as if it was the \nblackthorn wand\u2019s fault that he could no longer see into Voldemort\u2019s mind as well as \nbefore. \n\nAs the weeks crept on, Harry could not help but notice, even through his new self-\nabsorption, that Ron seemed to be taking charge. Perhaps because he was determined to \nmake up for having walked out on them, perhaps because Harry\u2019s descent into \nlistlessness galvanized his dormant leadership qualities, Ron was the one now \nencouraging and exhorting the other two into action. \n\n\u201cThree Horcruxes left,\u201d he kept saying. \u201cWe need a plan of action, come on! \nWhere haven\u2019t we looked? Let\u2019s go through it again. The orphanage\u2026\u201d \n\nDiagon Alley, Hogwarts, the Riddle House, Borgin and Burkes, Albania, every \nplace that they knew Tom Riddle had ever lived or worked, visited or murdered, Ron and \nHermione raked over them again, Harry joining in only to stop Hermione pestering him. \nHe would have been happy to sit alone in silence, trying to read Voldemort\u2019s thoughts, to \nfind out more about the Elder Wand, but Ron insisted on journeying to ever more \nunlikely places simply, Harry was aware, to keep them moving. \n\n\u201cYou never know,\u201d was Ron\u2019s constant refrain. \u201cUpper Flagley is a Wizarding \nvillage, he might\u2019ve wanted to live there. Let\u2019s go and have a poke around.\u201d \n\nThese frequent forays into Wizarding territory brought them within occasional \nsight of Snatchers. \n\n\u201cSome of them are supposed to be as bad as Death Eaters,\u201d said Ron. \u201cThe lot that \ngot me were a bit pathetic, but Bill recons some of them are really dangerous. They said \non Potterwatch ---\u201c \n\n\u201cOn what?\u201d said Harry. \n\n\u201cPotterwatch, didn\u2019t I tell you that\u2019s what it was called? The program I keep \ntrying to get on the radio, the only one that tells the truth about what\u2019s going on! Nearly \nall of the programs are following You-Know-Who\u2019s line, all except Potterwatch, I really \nwant you to hear it, but it\u2019s tricky tuning in\u2026\u201d \n\nRon spent evening after evening using his wand to beat out various rhythms on \ntop of the wireless while the dials whirled. Occasionally they would catch snatches of \nadvice on how to treat dragonpox, and once a few bars of \u201cA Cauldron Full of Hot, \nStrong Love.\u201d While he taped, Ron continued to try to hit on the correct password, \nmuttering strings of random words under his breath. \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re normally something to do with the Order,\u201d he told them. \u201cBill had a real \nknack for guessing them. I\u2019m bound to get one in the end\u2026\u201d \n\n\f\n\u201cBut not until March did luck favor Ron at last. Harry was sitting in the tent \nentrance, on guard duty, staring idly at a clump of grape hyacinths that had forced their \nway through the chilly ground, when Ron shouted excitedly from inside the tent. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got it, I\u2019ve got it! Password was \u2018Albus\u2019! Get in here, Harry.\u201d \n\nRoused for the first time in days from his contemplation of the Deathly Hallows, \nHarry hurried back inside the tent to find Ron and Hermione kneeling on the floor beside \nthe little radio. Hermione, who had been polishing the sword of Gryffindor just for \nsomething to do, was sitting open-mouthed, staring at the tiny speaker, from which a \nmost familiar voice was issuing. \n\n\u201c\u2026apologize for our temporary absence from the airwaves, which was due to a \nnumber of house calls in our area by those charming Death Eaters.\u201d \n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s Lee Jordan!\u201d said Hermione. \n\n\u201cI know!\u201d beamed Ron. \u201cCool, eh?\u201d \n\n\u201c\u2026now found ourselves another secure location,\u201d Lee was saying, and I\u2019m \npleased to tell you that two of our regular contributors have joined me here this evening. \nEvening, boys!\u201d \n\n\u201cHi.\u201d \n\n\u201cEvening, River.\u201d \n\n\u201c\u2019River\u2019\u201d that\u2019s Lee,\u201d Ron explained. \u201cThey\u2019ve all got code names, but you can \nusually tell ---\u201c \n\n\u201cShh!\u201d said Hermione. \n\n\u201cBut before we hear from Royal and Romulus,\u201d Lee went on, \u201clet\u2019s take a \nmoment to report those deaths that the Wizarding Wireless Network News and Daily \nProphet don\u2019t think important enough to mention. It is with great regret that we inform \nour listeners of the murders of Ted Tonks and Dirk Cresswell.\u201d \n\nHarry felt a sick, swooping in his belly. He, Ron, and Hermione gazed at one \nanother in horror. \n\n\u201cA goblin by the name of Gornuk was also killed. It is believed that Muggle-born \nDean Thomas and a second goblin, both believed to have been traveling with Tonks, \nCresswell, and Gornuk, may have escaped. If Dean is listening, or if anyone has any \nknowledge of his whereabouts, his parents and sisters are desperate for news. \n\n\u201cMeanwhile, in Gaddley, a Muggle family of five has been found dead in their \nhome. Muggle authorities are attributing their deaths to a gas leak, but members of the \nOrder of the Phoenix inform me that it was the Killing Curse --- more evidence, as if it \nwere needed, of the fact that Muggle slaughter is becoming little more than a recreational \nsport under the new regime. \n\n\u201cFinally, we regret to inform our listeners that the remains of Bathilda Bagshot \nhave been discovered in Godric\u2019s Hollow. The evidence is that she died several months \nago. The Order of the Phoenix informs us that her body showed unmistakable signs of \ninjuries inflicted by Dark Magic. \n\n\u201cListeners, I\u2019d like to invite you now to join us in a minute\u2019s silence in memory of \nTed Tonks, Dirk Cresswell, Bathilda Bagshot, Gornuk, and the unnamed, but no less \nregretted, Muggles murdered by the Death Eaters.\u201d \n\nSilence fell, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione did not speak. Half of Harry yearned \nto hear more, half of him was afraid of what might come next. It was the first time he had \nfelt fully connected to the outside world for a long time. \n\n\f\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Lee\u2019s voice. \u201cAnd now we can return to regular contributor \nRoyal, for an update on how the new Wizarding order is affecting the Muggle world.\u201d \n\n\u201cThanks, River,\u201d said an unmistakable voice, deep, measured, reassuring. \n\n\u201cKingsley!\u201d burst out Ron. \n\n\u201cWe know!\u201d said Hermione, hushing him. \n\n\u201cMuggles remain ignorant of the source of their suffering as they continue to \nsustain heavy casualties,\u201d said Kingsley. \u201cHowever, we continue to hear truly \ninspirational stories of wizards and witches risking their own safety to protect Muggle \nfriends and neighbors, often without the Muggles\u2019 knowledge. I\u2019d like to appeal to all our \nlisteners to emulate their example, perhaps by casting a protective charm over any \nMuggle dwellings in your street. Many lives could be saved if such simple measures are \ntaken.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd what would you say, Royal, to those listeners who reply that in these \ndangerous times, it should be \u2018Wizards first\u2019? asked Lee. \n\n\u201cI\u2019d say that it\u2019s one short step from \u2018Wizards first\u2019 to \u2018Purebloods first,\u2019 and then \nto \u2018Death Eaters,\u2019\u201d replied Kingsley. \u201cWe\u2019re all human, aren\u2019t we? Every human life is \nworth the same, and worth saving.\u201d \n\n\u201cExcellently put, Royal, and you\u2019ve got my vote for Minister of Magic if we ever \nget out of this mess,\u201d said Lee. \u201cAnd now, over to Romulus for our popular feature \u2018Pals \nof Potter.\u2019\u201d \n\n\u201cThanks, River,\u201d said another very familiar voice. Ron started to speak, but \nHermione forestalled him in a whisper. \n\n\u201cWe know it\u2019s Lupin!\u201d \n\n\u201cRomulus, do you maintain, as you have every time you\u2019ve appeared on our \nprogram, that Harry Potter is still alive?\u201d \n\n\u201cI do,\u201d said Lupin firmly. \u201cThere is no doubt at all in my mind that his death \nwould be proclaimed as widely as possible by the Death Eaters if it had happened, \nbecause it would strike a deadly blow at the morale of those resisting the new regime. \n\u2018The Boy Who Lived\u2019 remains a symbol of everything for which we are fighting: the \ntriumph of good, the power of innocence, the need to keep resisting.\u201d \n\nA mixture of gratitude and shame welled up in Harry. Had Lupin forgiven him, \nthen, for the terrible things he had said when they had last met? \n\n\u201cAnd what would you say to Harry if you knew he was listening, Romulus?\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019d tell him we\u2019re all with him in spirit,\u201d said Lupin, then hesitated slightly, \n\u201cAnd I\u2019d tell him to follow his instincts, which are good and nearly always right.\u201d \n\nHarry looked at Hermione, whose eyes were full of tears. \n\n\u201cNearly always right,\u201d she repeated. \n\n\u201cOh, didn\u2019t I tell you?\u201d said Ron in surprise. \u201cBill told me Lupin\u2019s living with \nTonks again! And apparently she\u2019s getting pretty big too\u2026\u201d \n\n\u201c\u2026and our usual update on those friends of Harry Potter\u2019s who are suffering for \ntheir allegiance?\u201d Lee was saying. \n\n \u201cWell, as regular listeners will know, several of the more outspoken supporters of \nHarry Potter have now been imprisoned, including Xenophilius Lovegood, erstwhile \neditor of The Quibbler,\u201d said Lupin. \n\n \u201cAt least he\u2019s still alive!\u201d muttered Ron. \n\n\f\n \u201cWe have also heard within the last few hours that Rubeus Hagrid\u201d \u2013 all three of \nthem gasped, and so nearly missed the rest of the sentence -- \u201cwell-known gamekeeper at \nHogwarts School, has narrowly escaped arrest within the grounds of Hogwarts, where he \nis rumored to have hosted a \u2018Support Harry Potter\u2019 party in his house. However, Hagrid \nwas not taken into custody, and is, we believe, on the run.\u201d \n\n \u201cI suppose it helps, when escaping from Death Eaters, if you\u2019ve got a sixteen-\nfoot-high half brother?\u201d asked Lee. \n\n \u201cIt would tend to give you an edge,\u201d agreed Lupin gravely. \u201cMay I just add that \nwhile we here at Potterwatch applaud Hagrid\u2019s spirit, we would urge even the most \ndevoted of Harry\u2019s supporters against following Hagrid\u2019s lead. \u2018Support Harry Potter\u2019 \nparties are unwise in the present climate.\u201d \n\n \u201cIndeed they are, Romulus,\u201d said Lee, \u201cso we suggest that you continue to show \nyour devotion to the man with the lightning scar by listening to Potterwatch! And now \nlet\u2019s move to news concerning the wizard who is proving just as elusive as Harry Potter. \nWe like to refer to him as the Chief Death Eater, and here to give his views on some of \nthe more insane rumors circulating about him, I\u2019d like to introduce a new correspondent. \nRodent?\u201d \n\n \u201c\u2019Rodent\u2019?\u201d said yet another familiar voice, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione cried \nout together: \n\n \u201cFred!\u201d \n\n \u201cNo \u2013 is it George?\u201d \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s Fred, I think,\u201d said Ron, leaning in closer, as whichever twin it was said, \n\n \u201cI\u2019m not being \u2018Rodent,\u2019 no way, I told you I wanted to be \u2018Rapier\u2019!\u201d \n\n \u201cOh, all right then, \u2018Rapier,\u2019 could you please give us your take on the various \nstories we\u2019ve been hearing about the Chief Death Eater?\u201d \n\n \u201cYes, River, I can,\u201d said Fred. \u201cAs our listeners will know, unless they\u2019ve taken \nrefuge at the bottom of a garden pond or somewhere similar, You-Know-Who\u2019s strategy \nof remaining in the shadows is creating a nice little climate of panic. Mind you, if all the \nalleged sightings of him are genuine, we must have a good nineteen You-Know-Whos \nrunning around the place.\u201d \n\n \u201cWhich suits him, of course,\u201d said Kingsley. \u201cThe air of mystery is creating more \nterror than actually showing himself.\u201d \n\n \u201cAgreed,\u201d said Fred. \u201cSo, people, let\u2019s try and calm down a bit. Things are bad \nenough without inventing stuff as well. For instance, this new idea that You-Know-Who \ncan kill people with a single glance from his eyes. That\u2019s a basilisk, listeners. One simple \ntest: Check whether the thing that\u2019s glaring at you has got legs. If it has, it\u2019s safe to look \ninto its eyes, although if it really is You-Know-Who, that\u2019s still likely to be the last thing \nyou ever do.\u201d \n\n For the first time in weeks and weeks, Harry was laughing: He could feel the \nweight of tension leaving him. \n\n \u201cAnd the rumors that he keeps being sighted abroad?\u201d asked Lee. \n\n \u201cWell, who wouldn\u2019t want a nice little holiday after all the hard work he\u2019s been \nputting in?\u201d asked Fred. \u201cPoint is, people, don\u2019t get lulled into a false sense of security, \nthinking he\u2019s out of the country. Maybe he is, maybe he isn\u2019t, but the fact remains he can \nmove faster than Severus Snape confronted with shampoo when he wants to, so don\u2019t \n\n\f\ncount on him being a long way away if you\u2019re planning to take any risks. I never thought \nI\u2019d hear myself say it, but safety first!\u201d \n\n \u201cThank you very much for those wise words, Rapier,\u201d said Lee. \u201dListeners, that \nbrings us to the end of another Potterwatch. We don\u2019t know when it will be possible to \nbroadcast again, but you can be sure we shall be back. Keep twiddling those dials: The \nnext password will be \u2018Mad-Eye.\u2019 Keep each other safe: Keep faith. Good night.\u201d \n\n The radio\u2019s dial twirled and the lights behind the tuning panel went out. Harry, \nRon, and Hermione were still beaming. Hearing familiar, friendly voices was an \nextraordinary tonic; Harry had become so used to their isolation he had nearly forgotten \nthat other people were resisting Voldemort. It was like waking from a long sleep. \n\n \u201cGood, eh?\u201d said Ron happily. \n\n \u201cBrilliant,\u201d said Harry. \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s so brave of them,\u201d sighed Hermione admiringly. \u201cIf they were found \u2026\u201d \n\n \u201cWell, they keep on the move, don\u2019t they?\u201d said Ron. \u201cLike us.\u201d \n\n \u201cBut did you hear what Fred said?\u201d asked Harry excitedly; now the broadcast was \nover, his thoughts turned around toward his all consuming obsession. \u201cHe\u2019s abroad! He\u2019s \nstill looking for the Wand, I knew it!\u201d \n\n \u201cHarry\u2014\u201c \n\n \u201cCome on, Hermione, why are you so determined not to admit it? Vol \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cHARRY, NO!\u201d \n\n \u201c\u2014demort\u2019s after the Elder Wand!\u201d \n\n \u201cThe name\u2019s Taboo!\u201d Ron bellowed, leaping to his feet as a loud crack sounded \noutside the tent. \u201cI told you, Harry, I told you, we can\u2019t say it anymore \u2013 we\u2019ve got to put \nthe protection back around us \u2013 quickly \u2013 it\u2019s how they find \u2013\u201c \n\n But Ron stopped talking, and Harry knew why. The Sneakoscope on the table had \nlit up and begun to spin; they could hear voices coming nearer and nearer: rough, excited \nvoices. Ron pulled the Deluminator out of his pocket and clicked it: Their lamps went out. \n\n \u201cCome out of there with your hands up!\u201d came a rasping voice through the \ndarkness. \u201cWe know you\u2019re in there! You\u2019ve got half a dozen wands pointing at you and \nwe don\u2019t care who we curse!\u201d \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter Twenty-Three \n\nMalfoy Manor \n\n \n\nHarry looked around at the other two, now mere outlines in the darkness. He saw \nHermione point her wand, set toward the outside, but into his face; there was a bang, a \nburst of white light, and he buckled in agony, unable to see. He could feel his face \nswelling rapidly under his hands as heavy footfalls surrounded him. \n\n \"Get up, vermin.\" \n\n Unknown hands dragged Harry roughly off the ground, before he could stop them, \nsomeone had rummaged through his pockets and removed the blackthorn wand. Harry \nclutched at his excruciatingly painful face, which felt unrecognizable beneath his fingers, \ntight, swollen, and puffy as though he had suffered some violent allergic reaction. His \n\n\f\neyes had been reduced to slits through which he could barely see; his glasses fell off as he \nwas bundled out of the tent: all he could make out were the blurred shapes of four or five \npeople wrestling Ron and Hermione outside too. \n\n \"Get -- off - her!\" Ron shouted. There was the unmistakable sound of knuckles \nhitting flesh: Ron grunted in pain and Hermione screamed, \"No! Leave him alone, leave \nhim alone!\" \n\n \"Your boyfriend's going to have worse than that done to him if he's on my list,\" \nsaid the horribly familiar, rasping voice. \"Delicious girl... what a treat . . . I do enjoy the \nsoftness of the skin. . . .\" \n\n Harry's stomach turned over. He knew who this was, Fenrit Greyback, the \nwerewolf who was permitted to wear Death Eater robes in return for his hired savagery. \n\n \"Search the tent!\" said another voice. \n\n Harry was thrown face down onto the ground. A thud told him that Ron had been \ncast down beside him. They could hear footsteps and crashes; the men were pushing over \nchairs inside the tent as they searched. \n\n \"Now, let's see who we've got,\" said Greyback's gloating voice from overhead, \nand Harry was rolled over onto his back. A beam of wand light fell onto his face and \nGreyback laughed. \n\n \"I'll be needing butterbeer to wash this one down. What happened to you, ugly?\" \n\n Harry did not answer immediately. \n\n \"I said,\" repeated Greyback, and Harry received a blow to the diaphragm that \nmade him double over in pain. \"what happened to you?\" \n\n \"Stung.\" Harry muttered. \"Been Stung.\" \n\n \"Yeah, looks like it.\" said a second voice. \n\n \"What\u2019s your name?\" snarled Greyback. \n\n \"Dudley.\" said Harry. \n\n \"And your first name?\" \n\n \"I -- Vernon. Vernon Dudley.\" \n\n \"Check the list, Scabior.\" said Greyback, and Harry head him move sideways to \nlook down at Ron, instead. \"And what about you, ginger?\" \n\n \"Stan Shunpike.\" said Ron. \n\n \"Like 'ell you are.\" said the man called Scabior. \"We know Stan Shunpike, 'e's put \na bit of work our way.\" \n\n There was another thud. \n\n \"I'b Bardy,\" said Ron, and Harry could tell that his mouth was full of blood. \n\"Bardy Weasley.\" \n\n \"A Weasley?\" rasped Greyback. \"So you're related to blood traitors even if you're \nnot a Mudblood. And lastly, your pretty little friend . . .\" The relish in his voice made \nHarry's flesh crawl. \n\n \"Easy, Greyback.\" said Scabior over the jeering of the others. \n\n \"Oh, I'm not going to bite just yet. We'll see if she\u2019s a bit quicker at remembering \nher name than Barny. Who are you, girly? \n\n \"Penelope Clearwater.\" said Hermione. She sounded terrified, but convincing. \n\n \"What's your blood status?\" \n\n \"Half-Blood.\" said Hermione. \n\n\f\n \"Easy enough to check,\" said Scabior. \"But the 'ole lot of 'em look like they could \nstill be 'ogwarts age -\" \n\n \"We'b lebt,\" said Ron. \n\n \"Left, 'ave you, ginger?\" said Scabior. \"And you decided to go camping? And you \nthought, just for a laugh, you'd use the Dark Lords name?\" \n\n \"Nod a laugh,\" said Ron. \"Aggiden.\" \n\n \"Accident?\" There was more jeering laughter. \n\n \"You know who used to like using the Dark Lord's name, Weasley?\" growled \nGreyback, \"The Order of the Phoenix. Mean anything to you?\" \n\n \"Doh.\" \n\n \"Well, they don't show the Dark Lord proper respect, so the name's been Tabooed. \nA few Order members have been tracked that way. We'll see. Bind them up with the \nother two prisoners!\" \n\n Someone yanked Harry up by the hair, dragged him a short way, pushed him \ndown into a sitting position, then started binding him back-to-back with other people. \nHarry was still half blind, barely able to see anything through his puffed-up eyes. When \nat last the man tying then had walked away, Harry whispered to the other prisoners. \n\n \"Anyone still got a wand?\" \n\n \"No.\" Said Ron and Hermione from either side of him. \n\n \"This is all my fault. I said the name. I'm sorry -\" \n\n \"Harry?\" \n\n It was a new, but familiar voice. and it came from directly behind Harry, from the \nperson tied to Hermione's left. \n\n \"Dean?\" \n\n \"It is you! If they find out who they've got -! They're Snatchers, they're only \nlooking for truants to sell for gold -\" \n\n \"Not a bad little haul for one night.\" Greyback was saying, as a pair of hobnailed \nboots marched close by Harry and they heard more crashes from inside the tent. \"A \nMudblood, a runaway goblin, and these truants. You checked their names on the list yet, \nScabior?\" he roared. \n\n \"Yeah. There's no Vernon Dudley un 'ere, Greyback.\" \n\n \"Interesting,\" said Greyback. \"That's interesting.\" \n\n He crouched down beside Harry, who saw, through the infinitesimal gap left \nbetween his swollen eyelids, a face covered in matted gray hair and whiskers, with \npointed brown teeth and sores in the corners of his mouth. Greyback smelled as he had \ndone at the top of the tower where Dumbledore had died: of dirt, sweat, and blood. \n\n \"So you aren't wanted, then, Vernon? Or are you on that list under a different \nname? What house were you in at Hogwarts?\" \n\n \"Slytherin,\" said Harry automatically. \n\n \"Funny 'ow they all thinks we wants to 'ear that.\" leered Scabior out of the \nshadows. \"But none of 'em can tell us where the common room is.\" \n\n \"It's in the dungeons.\" said Harry clearly. \"You enter through the wall. It's full of \nskulls and stuff and its under the lake, so the light's all green,\" \n\n There was a short pause. \n\n\f\n \"Well, well, looks like we really 'ave caught a little Slytherin.\" said Scabior. \n\"Good for you, Vernon, 'cause there ain't a lot of Mudblood Slytherins. Who's your \nfather?\" \n\n \"He works at the Ministry,\" Harry lied. He knew that his whole story would \ncollapse with the smallest investigation, but on the other hand, he only had until his face \nregained its usual appearance before the game was up in any case. \"Department of \nMagical Accidents and Catastrophes.\" \n\n \"You know what, Greyback,\" said Scabior. \"I think there is a Dudley in there.\" \n\n Harry could barely breathe: Could luck, sheer luck, get them safely out of this? \n\n \"Well, well.\" said Greyback, and Harry could hear the tiniest note of trepidation \nin that callous voice, and knew that Greyback was wondering whether he had just indeed \njust attacked and bound the son of a Ministry Official. Harry's heart was pounding against \nthe ropes around his ribs; he would not have been surprised to know that Greyback could \nsee it. \"If you're telling the truth, ugly, you've got nothing to fear from a trip to the \nMinistry. I expect your father'll reward us just for picking you up.\" \n\n \"But,\" said Harry, his mouth bone dry, \"if you just let us -\" \n\n \"Hey!\" came a shout from inside the tent. \"Look at this. Greyback!\" \n\n A dark figure came bustling toward them, and Harry saw a glint of silver to the \nlight of their wands. They had found Gryffindor's sword. \n\n \"Ve-e-ery nice,\" said Greyback appreciatively, taking it from his companion. \"Oh, \nvery nice indeed. Looks goblin-made, that. Where did you get something like this?\" \n\n \"It's my father's,\" Harry lied, hoping against hope that it was too dark for \nGreyback to see the name etched just below the hilt. \"We borrowed it to cut firewood -\" \n\n \"'ang on a minute, Greyback! Look at this, in the Prophet!\" \n\n As Scabior said it, Harry's scar, which was stretched tight across his distended \nforehead, burned savagely. More clearly than he could make out anything around him, he \nsaw a towering building, a grim fortress, jet-black and forbidding: Voldemort's thoughts \nhad suddenly become Razor-Sharp again; he was gliding toward the gigantic building \nwith a sense of calmly euphoric purpose . . . \n\n So close . . . So close . . . \n\nWith a huge effort of will Harry closed his mind to Voldemort's thoughts, pulling himself \nback to where he sat, tied to Ron, Hermione, Dean, and Griphook in the darkness, \nlistening to Greyback and Scabior. \n\n\"'Hermione Granger,\" Scabior was saying, \"the Mudblood who is known to be traveling \nwith 'arry Potter.\" \n\n Harry's scar burned in the silence, but he made a supreme effort to keep himself \npresent, nor to slip into Voldemort's mind. He heard the creak of Greyback's boots as he \ncrouched down, in front of Hermione. \n\n \"you know what, little girly? This picture looks a hell of a lot like you.\" \n\n \"It isn't! It isn't me!\" \n\n Hermione's terrified squeak was as good as a confession. \n\n \"... known to be traveling with Harry Potter,\" repeated Greyback quietly. \n\n A stillness had settled over the scene. Harry's scar was Exquisitely painful, but he \nstruggled with all his strength against the pull of Voldemort's thoughts. It had never been \nso important to remain in his own right mind. \n\n\f\n \"Well, this changed things, doesn't it?\" whispered Greyback. Nobody spoke: \nHarry sensed the gang of Snatchers watching, frozen, and felt Hermione's arm trembling \nagainst his. Greyback got up and took a couple of steps to where Harry sat, crouching \ndown again to stare closely at his misshapen features. \n\n \"What's that on your forehead, Vernon?\" he asked softly, his breath foul in \nHarry's nostrils as he pressed a filthy finger to the taught scar. \n\n \"Don't touch it! Harry yelled; he could not stop himself, he thought he might be \nsick from the pain of it. \n\n \"I thought you wore glasses, Potter?\" breathed Greyback. \n\n \"I found glasses!\" yelped one of the Snatchers skulking in the background. \"There \nwas glasses in the tent, Greyback, wait -\" \n\n And seconds later Harry's glasses had been rammed back onto his face. The \nSnatchers were closing in now, peering at him. \n\n \"It Is!\" rasped Greyback. \"We've caught Potter!\" \n\n They all took several steps backward, stunned by what they had done. Harry, still \nfighting to remain present in his own splitting head, could think of nothing to say. \nFragmented visions were breaking across the surface of his mind - \n\n --He was hiding around the high walls of the black fortress-- \n\n No, he was Harry, tied up and wandless, in grave danger-- \n\n --looking up, up to the topmost window, the highest tower-- \n\n He was Harry, and they were discussing his fate in low voices-- \n\n --Time to fly . . . \n\n \". . . To the Ministry?\" \n\n \"To hell with the Ministry.\" growled Greyback. \"They'll take the credit, and we \nwon't get a look in. I say we take him straight to You-Know-Who.\" \n\n \"Will you summon 'im? 'ere?\" said Scabior, sounding awed, terrified. \n\n \"No,\" snarled Greyback, \"I haven't got -- they say he's using the Malfoy's place as \na base. We'll take the boy there.\" \n\n Harry thought he knew why Greyback was not calling Voldemort. The werewolf \nmight be allowed to wear Death Eater robes when they wanted to use him, but only \nVoldemort's inner circle were branded with the Dark Mark: Greyback had not been \ngranted this highest honor. \n\nHarry\u2019s scar seared again \u2013 \n\n\u2013 and he rose into the night, flying straight up to the windows at the very top of \nthe tower \u2013 \n\n\u201c. . . completely sure it\u2019s him? \u2018Cause if it ain\u2019t, Greyback, we\u2019re dead.\u201d \n\n\u201cWho\u2019s in charge here?\u201d roared Greyback, covering his moment of inadequacy. \u201cI \nsay that\u2019s Potter, and him plus his wand, that\u2019s two hundred thousand Galleons right \nthere! But if you\u2019re too gutless to come along, any of you, it\u2019s all for me, and with any \nluck, I\u2019ll get the girl thrown in!\u201d \n\n \u2013 The window was the merest slit in the black rock, not big enough for a man to \nenter. . . . A skeletal figure was just visible through it, curled beneath a blanket. . . . Dead, \nor sleeping . . . ? \n\n\u201cAll right!\u201d said Scabior. \u201cAll right, we\u2019re in! And what about the rest of \u2018em, \nGreyback, what\u2019ll we do with \u2018em?\u201d \n\n\f\n\u201cMight as well take the lot. We\u2019ve got two Mudbloods, that\u2019s another ten \nGalleons. Give me the sword as well. If they\u2019re rubies, that\u2019s another small fortune right \nthere.\u201d \n\nThe prisoners were dragged to their feet. Harry could hear Hermione\u2019s breathing, \nfast and terrified. \n\n\u201cGrab hold and make it tight. I\u2019ll do Potter!\u201d said Greyback, seizing a fistful of \nHarry\u2019s hair; Harry could feel his long yellow nails scratching his scalp. \u201cOn three! One \u2013 \ntwo \u2013 three \u2013\u201c \n\nThey Disapparated, pulling the prisoners with them. Harry struggled, trying to \nthrow off Greyback\u2019s hand, but it was hopeless: Ron and Hermione were squeezed tightly \nagainst him on either side; he could not separate from the group, and as the breath was \nsqueezed out of him his scar seared more painfully still \u2013 \n\n \u2013 as he forced himself through the slit of a window like a snake and landed, \nlightly as vapor inside the cell-like room \u2013 \n\n The prisoners lurched into one another as they landed in a country lane. Harry\u2019s \neyes, still puffy, took a moment to acclimatize, then he saw a pair of wrought-iron gates \nat the foot of what looked like a long drive. He experienced the tiniest trickle of relief. \nThe worst had not happened yet: Voldemort was not here. He was, Harry knew, for he \nwas fighting to resist the vision, in some strange, fortresslike place, at the top of a tower. \nHow long it would take Voldemort to get to this place, once he knew that Harry was here, \nwas another matter. . . . \n\n One of the Snatchers strode to the gates and shook them. \n\n \u201cHow do we get in? They\u2019re locked, Greyback, I can\u2019t \u2013 blimey!\u201d \n\n He whipped his hands away in fright. The iron was contorting, twisting itself out \nof the abstract furls and coils into a frightening face, which spoke in a clanging, echoing \nvoice. \u201cState your purpose!\u201d \n\n \u201cWe\u2019ve got Potter!\u201d Greyback roared triumphantly. \u201cWe\u2019ve captured Harry \nPotter!\u201d \n\n The gates swung open. \n\n \u201cCome on!\u201d said Greyback to his men, and the prisoners were shunted through the \ngates and up the drive, between high hedges that muffled their footsteps. Harry saw a \nghostly white shape above him, and realized it was an albino peacock. He stumbled and \nwas dragged onto his feet by Greyback; now he was staggering along sideways, tied \nback-to-back to the four other prisoner. Closing his puffy eyes, he allowed the pain in his \nscar to overcome him for a moment, wanting to know what Voldemort was doing, \nwhether he knew yet that Harry was caught. . . . \n\n The emaciated figure stirred beneath its thin blanket and rolled over toward him, \neyes opening in a skull of a face. . . . The frail man sat up, great sunken eyes fixed upon \nhim, upon Voldemort, and then he smiled. Most of his teeth were gone. . . . \n\n \u201cSo, you have come. I thought you would . . . one day. But your journey was \npointless. I never had it.\u201d \n\n \u201cYou lie!\u201d \n\n As Voldemort\u2019s anger throbbed inside him, Harry\u2019s scar threatened to burst with \npain, and he wrenched his mind back to his own body, fighting to remain present as the \nprisoners were pushed over gravel. \n\n\f\n Light spilled out over all of them. \n\n \u201cWhat is this?\u201d said a woman\u2019s cold voice. \n\n \u201cWe\u2019re here to see He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!\u201d rasped Greyback. \n\n \u201cWho are you?\u201d \n\n \u201cYou know me!\u201d There was resentment in the werewolf\u2019s voice. \u201cFenrit \nGreyback! We\u2019ve caught Harry Potter!\u201d \n\n Greyback seized Harry and dragged him around to face the light, forcing the other \nprisoners to shuffle around too. \n\n \u201cI know \u2018es swollen, ma\u2019am, but it\u2019s \u2018im!\u201d piped up Scabior. \u201cIf you look a bit \ncloser, you\u2019ll see \u2018is scar. And this \u2018ere, see the girl? The Mudblood who\u2019s been traveling \naround with \u2018im, ma\u2019am. There\u2019s no doubt it\u2019s \u2018im, and we\u2019ve got \u2018is wand as well! \u2018Ere, \nma\u2019am \u2013\u201c \n\n Through his puffy eyelids Harry saw Narcissa Malfoy scrutinizing his swollen \nface. Scabior thrust the blackthorn wand at her. She raised her eyebrows. \n\n \u201cBring them in,\u201d she said. \n\n Harry and the others were shoved and kicked up broad stone steps into a hallway \nlined with portraits. \n\n \u201cFollow me,\u201d said Narcissa, leading the way across the hall. \u201cMy son, Draco, is \nhome for his Easter holidays. If that is Harry Potter, he will know.\u201d \n\n The drawing room dazzled after the darkness outside; even with his eyes almost \nclosed Harry could make out the wide proportions of the room. A crystal chandelier hung \nfrom the ceiling, more portraits against the dark purple walls. Two figures rose from \nchairs in front of an ornate marble fireplace as the prisoners were forced into the room by \nthe Snatchers. \n\n \u201cWhat is this?\u201d \n\n The dreadfully familiar, drawling voice of Lucius Malfoy fell on Harry\u2019s ears. He \nwas panicking now. He could see no way out, and it was easier, as his fear mounted, to \nblock out Voldemort\u2019s thoughts, though his scar was still burning. \n\n \u201cThey say they\u2019ve got Potter,\u201d said Narcissa\u2019s cold voice. \u201cDraco, come here.\u201d \nHarry did not dare look directly at Draco, but saw him obliquely; a figure slightly \ntaller than he was, rising from an armchair, his face a pale and pointed blur beneath \nwhite-blond hair. \n\n Greyback forced the prisoners to turn again so as to place Harry directly beneath \nthe chandelier. \n\n \u201cWell, boy?\u201d rasped the werewolf. \n\n Harry was facing a mirror over the fireplace, a great gilded thing in an intricately \nscrolled frame. Through the slits of his eyes he saw his own reflection for the first time \nsince leaving Grimmauld Place. \n\n His face was huge, shiny, and pink, every feature distorted by Hermione\u2019s jinx. \nHis black hair reached his shoulders and there was a dark shadow around his jaw. Had he \nnot known that it was he who stood there, he would have wondered who was wearing his \nglasses. He resolved not to speak, for his voice was sure to give him away; yet he still \navoided eye contact with Draco as the latter approached. \n\n \u201cWell, Draco?\u201d said Lucius Malfoy. He sounded avid. \u201cIs it? Is it Harry Potter?\u201d \n\u201cI can\u2019t \u2013 I can\u2019t be sure,\u201d said Draco. He was keeping his distance from \nGreyback, and seemed as scared of looking at Harry as Harry was of looking at him. \n\n\f\n \u201cBut look at him carefully, look! Come closer!\u201d \n\n Harry had never heard Lucius Malfoy so excited. \n\n \u201cDraco, if we are the ones who hand Potter over to the Dark Lord, everything will \nbe forgiv \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cNow, we won\u2019t be forgetting who actually caught him, I hope Mr. Malfoy?\u201d said \nGreyback menacingly. \n\n \u201cOf course not, of course not!\u201d said Lucius impatiently. He approached Harry \nhimself, came so close that Harry could see the usually languid, pale face in sharp detail \neven through his swollen eyes. With his face a puffy mask, Harry felt as though he was \npeering out from between the bars of a cage. \n\n \u201cWhat did you do to him?\u201d Lucius asked Greyback. \u201cHow did he get into this \nstate?\u201d \n\n \u201cThat wasn\u2019t us.\u201d \n\u201cLooks more like a Stinging Jinx to me,\u201d said Lucius. \n\n His gray eyes raked Harry\u2019s forehead. \n\n \u201cThere\u2019s something there,\u201d he whispered. \u201cit could be the scar, stretched \ntight. . . .\u201d Draco, come here, look properly! What do you think?\u201d \n\n Harry saw Draco\u2019s face up close now, right beside his father\u2019s. They were \nextraordinarily alike, except that while his father looked beside himself with excitement, \nDraco\u2019s expression was full of reluctance, even fear. \n\n \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, and he walked away toward the fireplace where his \nmother stood watching. \n\n \u201cWe had better be certain, Lucius,\u201d Narcissa called to her husband in her cold, \nclear voice. \u201cCompletely sure that it is Potter, before we summon the Dark Lord . . . They \nsay this is his\u201d \u2013 she was looking closely at the blackthorn wand \u2013 \u201cbut it does not \nresemble Ollivander\u2019s description. . . . If we are mistaken, if we call the Dark Lord here \nfor nothing . . . Remember what he did to Rowle and Dolohov?\u201d \n\n \u201cWhat about the Mudblood, then?\u201d growled Greyback. Harry was nearly thrown \noff his feet as the Snatchers forced the prisoners to swivel around again, so that the light \nfell on Hermione instead. \n\n \u201cWait,\u201d said Narcissa sharply. \u201cYes \u2013 yes, she was in Madam Malkin\u2019s with \nPotter! I saw her picture in the Prophet! Look, Draco, isn\u2019t it the Granger girl?\u201d \n\n \u201cI . . . maybe . . . yeah.\u201d \n\n \u201cBut then, that\u2019s the Weasley boy!\u201d shouted Lucius, striding around the bound \nprisoners to face Ron. \u201cIt\u2019s them, Potter\u2019s friends \u2013 Draco, look at him, isn\u2019t it Arthur \nWeasley\u2019s son, what\u2019s his name \u2013 ?\u201d \n\n \u201cYeah,\u201d said Draco again, his back to the prisoners. \u201cIt could be.\u201d \n\n The drawing room door opened behind Harry. A woman spoke, and the sound of \nthe voice wound Harry\u2019s fear to an even higher pitch. \n\n \u201cWhat is this? What\u2019s happened, Cissy?\u201d \n\n Bellatrix Lestrange walked slowly around the prisoners, and stopped on Harry\u2019s \nright, staring at Hermione through her heavily lidded eyes, \n\n \u201cBut surely,\u201d she said quietly, \u201cthis is the Mudblood girl? This is Grander?\u201d \n\n \u201cYes, yes, it\u2019s Granger!\u201d cried Lucius, \u201cAnd beside her, we think, Potter! Potter \nand his friends, caught at last!\u201d \n\u201cPotter?\u201d shrieked Bellatrix, and she backed away, the better to take in Harry. \n\n\f\n\u201cAre you sure? Well then, the Dark Lord must be informed at once!\u201d \nShe dragged back her left sleeve: Harry saw the Dark Mark burned into the flesh \nof her arm, and knew that she was about to touch it, to summon her beloved master\u2013 \n\n \u201cI was about to call him!\u201d said Lucius, and his hand actually closed upon \nBellatrix\u2019s wrist, preventing her from touching the Mark. \u201cI shall summon him, Bella. \nPotter has been brought to my house, and it is therefore upon my authority \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cYour authority!\u201d she sneered, attempting to wrench her hand from his grasp. \n\u201cYou lost your authority when you lost your wand, Lucius! How dare you! Take your \nhands off me!\u201d \n\n \u201cThis is nothing to do with you, you did not capture the boy \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cBegging your pardon, Mr. Malfoy,\u201d interjected Greyback, \u201cbut it\u2019s us that caught \nPotter, and it\u2019s us that\u2019ll be claiming the gold \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cGold!\u201d laughed Bellatrix, still attempting to throw off her brother-in-law, her \nfree hand groping in her pocket for her wand. \u201cTake your gold, filthy scavenger, what do \nI want with gold? I seek only the honor of his \u2013 of \u2013\u201c \n\n She stopped struggling, her dark eyes fixed upon something Harry could not see. \nJubilant at her capitulation, Lucius threw her hand from him and ripped up his own sleeve \n\u2013 \n\n \u201cSTOP!\u201d shrieked Bellatrix, \u201cDo not touch it, we shall all perish if the Dark Lord \ncomes now!\u201d \n\n Lucius froze, his index finger hovering over his own Mark. Bellatrix strode out of \nHarry\u2019s limited line of vision. \n\n \u201cWhat is that?\u201d he heard her say. \n\n \u201cSword,\u201d grunted an out-of-sight Snatcher. \n\n \u201cGive it to me.\u201d \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s not yours, missus, it\u2019s mine, I reckon I found it.\u201d \n\n There was a bang and a flash of red light; Harry knew that the Snatcher had been \nStunned. There was a roar of anger from his fellows: Scabior drew his wand. \n\n \u201cWhat d\u2019you think you\u2019re playing at, woman?\u201d \n\n \u201cStupefy!\u201d she screamed, \u201dStupefy!\u201d \n\n They were no match for her, even thought there were four of them against one of \nher: She was a witch, as Harry knew, with prodigious skill and no conscience. They fell \nwhere they stood, all except Greyback, who had been forced into a kneeling position, his \narms outstretched. Out of the corners of his eyes Harry saw Bellatrix bearing down upon \nthe werewolf, the sword of Gryffindor gripped tightly in her hand, her face waxen. \n\n \u201cWhere did you get this sword?\u201d she whispered to Greyback as she pulled his \nwand out of his unresisting grip. \n\n \u201cHow dare you?\u201d he snarled, his mouth the only thing that could move as he was \nforced to gaze up at her. He bared his pointed teeth. \u201cRelease me, woman!\u201d \n\u201cWhere did you find this sword?\u201d she repeated, brandishing it in his face, \u201cSnape \nsent it to my vault in Gringotts!\u201d \n\n \u201cIt was in their tent,\u201d rasped Greyback. \u201cRelease me, I say!\u201d \n\n She waved her wand, and the werewolf sprang to his feet, but appeared too wary \nto approach her. He prowled behind an armchair, his filthy curved nails clutching its back. \n\n \u201cDraco, move this scum outside,\u201d said Bellatrix, indicating the unconscious men. \n\u201cIf you haven\u2019t got the guts to finish them, then leave them in the courtyard for me.\u201d \n\n\f\n \u201cDon\u2019t you dare speak to Draco like \u2013\u201c said Narcissa furiously, but Bellatrix \nscreamed. \n\n \u201cBe quiet! The situation is graver than you can possibly imagine, Cissy! We have \na very serious problem!\u201d \n\n She stood, panting slightly, looking down at the sword, examining its hilt. Then \nshe turned to look at the silent prisoners. \n\n \u201cIf it is indeed Potter, he must not be harmed,\u201d she muttered, more to herself than \nto the others. \u201cThe Dark Lord wishes to dispose of Potter himself. . . . But if he finds \nout . . . I must . . . I must know. . . .\u201d \n\n She turned back to her sister again. \n\n\u201cThe prisoners must be placed in the cellar, while I think what to do!\u201d \n\u201cThis is my house, Bella, you don\u2019t give orders in my \u2013\u201c \n\n\u201cDo it! You have no idea of the danger we\u2019re in!\u201d shrieked Bellatrix. She looked \nfrightening, mad; a thin stream of fire issued from her wand and burned a hole in the \ncarpet. \n\nNarcissa hesitated for a moment, then addressed the werewolf. \n\n\u201cTake these prisoners down to the cellar, Greyback.\u201d \n\n\u201cWait,\u201d said Bellatrix sharply. \u201cAll except. . . . except for the Mudblood.\u201d \nGreyback gave a grunt of pleasure. \n\n\u201cNo!\u201d shouted Ron. \u201cYou can have me, keep me!\u201d \nBellatrix hit him across the face: the blow echoed around the room. \n\n\u201cIf she dies under questioning, I\u2019ll take you next,\u201d she said. \u201cBlood traitor is next \nto Mudblood in my book. Take them downstairs, Greyback, and make sure they are \nsecure, but do nothing more to them \u2013 yet.\u201d \n\nShe threw Greyback\u2019s wand back to him, then took a short silver knife from under \nher robes. She cut Hermione free from the other prisoners, then dragged her by the hair \ninto the middle of the room, while Greyback forced the rest of them to shuffle across to \nanother door, into a dark passageway, his wand held out in front of him, projecting an \ninvisible and irresistible force. \n\n\u201cReckon she\u2019ll let me have a bit of the girl when she\u2019s finished with her?\u201d \nGreyback crooned as he forced them along the corridor. \u201cI\u2019d say I\u2019ll get a bite or two, \nwouldn\u2019t you, ginger?\u201d \n\nHarry could feel Ron shaking. They were forced down a steep flight of stairs, still \ntied back-to-back and in danger of slipping and breaking their necks at any moment. At \nthe bottom was a heavy door. Greyback unlocked it with a tap of his wand, then forced \nthem into a dank and musty room and left them in total darkness. The echoing bang of the \nslammed cellar door had not died away before there was a terrible, drawn out scream \nfrom directly above them. \n\n\u201cHERMIONE!\u201d Ron bellowed, and he started to writhe and struggle against the \nropes tying them together, so that Harry staggered. \u201cHERMIONE!\u201d \n\n\u201cBe quiet!\u201d Harry said. \u201cShut up. Ron, we need to work out a way \u2013\u201c \n\n\u201cHERMIONE! HERMIONE!\u201d \n\n\u201cWe need a plan, stop yelling \u2013 we need to get these ropes off \u2013\u201c \n\n\u201cHarry?\u201d came a whisper through the darkness. \u201cRon? Is that you?\u201d \n\nRon stopped shouting. There was a sound of movement close by them, then Harry \nsaw a shadow moving closer. \n\n\f\n\u201cHarry? Ron?\u201d \n\n\u201cLuna?\u201d \n\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s me! Oh no, I didn\u2019t want you to be caught!\u201d \n\n\u201cLuna, can you help us get these ropes off?\u201d said Harry. \n\n\u201cOh yes, I expect so. . . . There\u2019s an old nail we use if we need to break \nanything. . . . Just a moment . . .\u201d \n\nHermione screamed again from overhead, and they could hear Bellatrix \nscreaming too, but her words were inaudible, for Ron shouted again, \u201cHERMIONE! \nHERMIONE!\u201d \n\n\u201cMr. Ollivander?\u201d Harry could hear Luna saying. \u201cMr. Ollivander, have you got \nthe nail? If you just move over a little bit . . . I think it was beside the water jug.\u201d \n\nShe was back within seconds. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll need to stay still,\u201d she said. \n\nHarry could feel her digging at the rope\u2019s tough fibers to work the knots free. \nFrom upstairs they heard Bellatrix\u2019s voice. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to ask you again! Where did you get this sword? Where?\u201d \n\n\u201cWe found it \u2013 we found it \u2013 PLEASE!\u201d Hermione screamed again; Ron \nstruggled harder than ever, and the rusty nail slipped onto Harry\u2019s wrist. \n\n\u201cRon, please stay still!\u201d Luna whispered. \u201cI can\u2019t see what I\u2019m doing \u2013\u201c \n\n\u201cMy pocket!\u201d said Ron, \u201cIn my pocket, there\u2019s a Deluminator, and it\u2019s full of \nlight!\u201d \n\nA few seconds later, there was a click, and the luminescent spheres the \nDeluminator had sucked from the lamps in the tent flew into the cellar: Unable to rejoin \ntheir sources, they simply hung there, like tiny suns, flooding the underground room with \nlight. Harry saw Luna, all eyes in her white face, and the motionless figure of Ollivander \nthe wandmaker, curled up on the floor in the corner. Craning around, he caught sight of \ntheir fellow prisoners: Dean and Griphook the goblin, who seemed barely conscious, kept \nstanding by the ropes that bound him to the humans. \n\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s much easier, thanks, Ron,\u201d said Luna, and she began hacking at their \nbindings again. \u201cHello, Dean!\u201d \n\nFrom above came Bellatrix\u2019s voice. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re lying, filthy Mudblood, and I know it! You have been inside my vault at \nGringotts! Tell the truth, tell the truth!\u201d \n\nAnother terrible scream\u2013 \n\n\u201cHERMIONE!\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat else did you take? What else have you got? Tel me the truth or, I swear, I \nshall run you through with this knife!\u201d \n\n\u201cThere!\u201d \n\nHarry felt the ropes fall away and turned, rubbing his wrists, to see Ron running \naround the cellar, looking up at the low ceiling, searching for a trapdoor. Dean, his face \nbruised and bloody, said \u201cThanks\u201d to Luna and stood there, shivering, but Griphook sank \nonto the cellar floor, looking groggy and disoriented, many welts across his swarthy face. \n\nRon was now trying to Disapparate without a wand. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way out, Ron,\u201d said Luna, watching his fruitless efforts. \u201cThe cellar \nis completely escape-proof. I tried, at first. Mr. Ollivander has been here for a long time, \nhe\u2019s tried everything.\u201d \n\n\f\nHermione was screaming again: The sound went through Harry like physical pain. \nBarely conscious of the fierce prickling of his scar, he too started to run around the cellar, \nfeeling the walls for he hardly knew what, knowing in his heart that it was useless. \n\n\u201cWhat else did you take, what else? ANSWER ME! CRUCIO!\u201d \n\nHermione\u2019s screams echoed off the walls upstairs, Ron was half sobbing as he \npounded the walls with his fists, and Harry in utter desperation seized Hagrid\u2019s pouch \nfrom around his neck and groped inside it: He pulled out Dumbledore\u2019s Snitch and shook \nit, hoping for he did not know what \u2013 nothing happened \u2013 he waved the broken halves of \nthe phoenix wand, but they were lifeless \u2013 the mirror fragment fell sparkling to the floor, \nand he saw a gleam of brightest blue \u2013 \n\nDumbledore\u2019s eye was gazing at him out of the mirror. \n\n\u201cHelp us!\u201d he yelled at it in mad desperation. \u201cWe\u2019re in the cellar of Malfoy \nManor, help us!\u201d \n\nThe eye blinked and was gone. \n\nHarry was not even sure that it had really been there. He tilted the shard of mirror \nthis way and that, and saw nothing reflected there but the walls and ceiling of their prison, \nand upstairs Hermione was screaming worse than ever, and next to him Ron was \nbellowing, \u201cHERMIONE! HERMIONE!\u201d \n\n\u201cHow did you get into my vault?\u201d they heard Bellatrix scream. \u201cDid that dirty \nlittle goblin in the cellar help you?\u201d \n\n\u201cWe only met him tonight!\u201d Hermione sobbed. \u201cWe\u2019ve never been inside your \nvault. . . . It isn\u2019t the real sword! It\u2019s a copy, just a copy!\u201d \n\n\u201cA copy?\u201d screeched Bellatrix. \u201cOh, a likely story!\u201d \n\n\u201cBut we can find out easily!\u201d came Lucius\u2019s voice. \u201cDraco, fetch the goblin, he \ncan tell us whether the sword is real or not!\u201d \n\nHarry dashed across the cellar to where Griphook was huddled on the floor. \n\n\u201cGriphook,\u201d he whispered into the goblin\u2019s pointed ear, \u201cyou must tell them that \nsword\u2019s a fake, they mustn\u2019t know it\u2019s the real one, Griphook, please \u2013\u201c \n\nHe could hear someone scuttling own the cellar steps; next moment, Draco\u2019s \nshaking voice spoke from behind the door. \n\n\u201cStand back. Line up against the back wall. Don\u2019t try anything, or I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d \n\nThey did as they were bidden; as the lock turned, Ron clicked the Deluminator \nand the lights whisked back into his pocket, restoring the cellar\u2019s darkness. The door flew \nopen; Malfoy marched inside, wand held out in front of him, pale and determined. He \nseized the little goblin by the arm and backed out again, dragging Griphook with him. \nThe door slammed shut and at the same moment a loud crack echoed inside the cellar. \n\nRon clicked the Deluminator. Three balls of light flew back into the air from his \npocket, revealing Dobby the house-elf, who had just Apparated into their midst. \n\n\u201cDOB \u2013 !\u201d \n\nHarry hit Ron on the arm to stop him shouting, and Ron looked terrified at his \nmistake. Footsteps crossed the ceiling overhead: Draco marching Griphook to Bellatrix. \n\nDobby\u2019s enormous, tennis-ball shaped eyes were wide; he was trembling from his \nfeet to the tips of his ears. He was back in the home of his old masters, and it was clear \nthat he was petrified. \n\n\u201cHarry Potter,\u201d he squeaked in the tiniest quiver of a voice, \u201cDobby has come to \nrescue you.\u201d \n\n\f\n\u201cBut how did you \u2013 ?\u201d \n\nAn awful scream drowned Harry\u2019s words: Hermione was being tortured again. He \ncut to the essentials. \n\n\u201cYou can Disapparate out of this cellar?\u201d he asked Dobby, who nodded, his ears \nflapping. \n\n\u201cAnd you can take humans with you?\u201d \n\nDobby nodded again. \n\n\u201cRight. Dobby, I want you to grab Luna, Dean, and Mr. Ollivander, and take them \n\u2013 take them to \u2013\u201c \n\n\u201cBill and Fleur\u2019s,\u201d said Ron. \u201cShell Cottage on the outskirts of Tinworth!\u201d \n\nThe elf nodded for a third time. \n\n\u201cAnd then come back,\u201d said Harry. \u201cCan you do that, Dobby?\u201d \n\n\u201cOf course, Harry Potter,\u201d whispered the little elf. He hurried over to Mr. \nOllivander, who appeared to be barely conscious. He took one of the wandmaker\u2019s hands \nin his own, then held out the other to Luna and Dean, neither of whom moved. \n\n\u201cHarry, we want to help you!\u201d Luna whispered. \n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t leave you here,\u201d said Dean. \n\n\u201cGo, both of you! We\u2019ll see you at Bill and Fleur\u2019s.\u201d \n\nAs Harry spoke, his scar burned worse than ever, and for a few seconds he looked \ndown, not upon the wandmaker, but on another man who was just as old, just as thin, but \nlaughing scornfully. \n\n\u201cKill me, then. Voldemort, I welcome death! But my death will not bring you what \nyou seek. . . . There is so much you do not understand. . .\u201d \n\nHe felt Voldemort\u2019s fury, but as Hermione screamed again he shut it out, \nreturning to the cellar and the horror of his own present. \n\n\u201cGo!\u201d Harry beseeched to Luna and Dean. \u201cGo! We\u2019ll follow, just go!\u201d \n\nThey caught hold of the elf\u2019s outstretched fingers. There was another loud crack, \nand Dobby, Luna, Dean, and Ollivander vanished. \n\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d shouted Lucius Malfoy from over their heads. \u201cDid you hear \nthat? What was that noise in the cellar?\u201d \n\nHarry and Ron stared at each other. \n\n\u201cDraco \u2013 no, call Wormtail! Make him go and check!\u201d \n\nFootsteps crossed the room overhead, then there was silence. Harry knew that the \npeople in the drawing room were listening for more noises from the cellar. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to try and tackle him,\u201d he whispered to Ron. They had no \nchoice: The moment anyone entered the room and saw the absence of three prisoners, \nthey were lost. \u201cLeave the lights on,\u201d Harry added, and as they heard someone \ndescending the steps outside the door, they backed against the wall on either side of it. \n\n\u201cStand back,\u201d came Wormtail\u2019s voice. \u201cStand away from the door. I\u2019m coming \nin.\u201d \nThe door flew open. For a split second Wormtail gazed into the apparently empty cellar, \nablaze with light from the three miniature suns floating in midair. Then Harry and Ron \nlaunched themselves upon him. Ron seized Wormtail\u2019s wand arm and forced it upwards. \nHarry slapped a hand to his mouth, muffling his voice. Silently they struggled: \nWormtail\u2019s wand emitted sparks; his silver hand closed around Harry\u2019s throat. \n\n\u201cWhat is it, Wormtail?\u201d called Lucius Malfoy from above. \n\n\f\n\u201cNothing!\u201d Ron called back, in a passable imitation of Wormtail\u2019s wheezy voice. \n\u201cAll fine!\u201d \n\nHarry could barely breathe. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to kill me?\u201d Harry choked, attempting to prise off the metal fingers. \n\u201cAfter I saved your life? You owe me, Wormtail!\u201d \n\nThe silver fingers slackened. Harry had not expected it: He wrenched himself free, \nastonished, keeping his hand over Wormtail\u2019s mouth. He saw the ratlike man\u2019s small \nwatery eyes widen with fear and surprise: He seemed just as shocked as Harry at what his \nhand had done, at the tiny, merciful impulse it had betrayed, and he continued to struggle \nmore powerfully, as though to undo that moment of weakness. \n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019ll have that,\u201d whispered Ron, tugging Wormtail\u2019s wand from his other \nhand. \n\nWandless, helpless, Pettigrew\u2019s pupils dilated in terror. His eyes had slid from \nHarry\u2019s face to something else. His own silver fingers were moving inexorably toward \nhis own throat. \n\n\u201cNo \u2013\u201c \n\nWithout pausing to think, Harry tried to drag back the hand, but there was no \nstopping it. The silver tool that Voldemort had given his most cowardly servant had \nturned upon its disarmed and useless owner; Pettigrew was reaping his reward for his \nhesitation, his moment of pity; he was being strangled before their eyes. \n\n\u201cNo!\u201d \n\nRon had released Wormtail too, and together he and Harry tried to pull the \ncrushing metal fingers from around Wormtail\u2019s throat, but it was no use. Pettigrew was \nturning blue. \n\n\u201cRelashio!\u201d said Ron, pointing the wand at the silver hand, but nothing happened; \nPettigrew dropped to his knees, and at the same moment, Hermione gave a dreadful \nscream from overhead. Wormtail\u2019s eyes rolled upward in his purple face; he gave a last \ntwitch, and was still. \n\nHarry and Ron looked at each other, then leaving Wormtail\u2019s body on the floor \nbehind them, ran up the stairs and back into the shadowy passageway leading to the \ndrawing room. Cautiously they crept along it until they reached the drawing room door, \nwhich was ajar. Now they had a clear view of Bellatrix looking down at Griphook, who \nwas holding Gryffindor\u2019s sword in his long-fingered hands. Hermione was lying at \nBellatrix\u2019s feet. She was barely stirring. \n\n\u201cWell?\u201d Bellatrix said to Griphook. \u201cIs it the true sword?\u201d \n\nHarry waited, holding his breath, fighting against the prickling of his scar. \n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Griphook. \u201cIt is a fake.\u201d \n\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d panted Bellatrix. \u201cQuite sure?\u201d \n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said the goblin. \n\nRelief broke across her face, all tension drained from it. \n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said, and with a casual flick of her wand she slashed another deep cut \ninto the goblin\u2019s face, and he dropped with a yell at her feet. She kicked him aside. \u201cAnd \nnow,\u201d she said in a voice that burst with triumph, \u201cwe call the Dark Lord!\u201d \n\nAnd she pushed back her sleeve and touched her forefinger to the Dark Mark. \n\nAt once, Harry\u2019s scar felt as though it had split open again. His true surroundings \nvanished: He was Voldemort, and the skeletal wizard before him was laughing \n\n\f\ntoothlessly at him; he was enraged at the summons he felt \u2013 he had warned them, he had \ntold them to summon him for nothing less than Potter. If they were mistaken . . . \n\n\u201cKill me, then!\u201d demanded the old man. \u201cYou will not win, you cannot win! That \nwand will never, ever be yours \u2013\u201c \n\nAnd Voldemort\u2019s fury broke: A burst of green light filled the prison room and the \nfrail old body was lifted from its hard bed and then fell back, lifeless, and Voldemort \nreturned to the window, his wrath barely controllable. . . . They would suffer his \nretribution if they had no good reason for calling him back. . . . \n\n\u201cAnd I think,\u201d said Bellatrix\u2019s voice, \u201cwe can dispose of the Mudblood. Greyback, \ntake her if you want her.\u201d \n\n\u201cNOOOOOOOOOOOO!\u201d \n\nRon had burst into the drawing room; Bellatrix looked around, shocked; she \nturned her wand to face Ron instead \u2013 \n\n\u201cExpelliarmus!\u201d he roared, pointing Wormtail\u2019s wand at Bellatrix, and hers flew \ninto the air and was caught by Harry, who had sprinted after Ron. Lucius, Narcissa, \nDraco and Greyback wheeled about; Harry yelled, \u201cStupefy!\u201d and Lucius Malfoy \ncollapsed onto the hearth. Jets of light flew from Draco\u2019s, Narcissa\u2019s, and Greyback\u2019s \nwands; Harry threw himself to the floor, rolling behind a sofa to avoid them. \n\n\u201cSTOP OR SHE DIES! \n\nPanting, Harry peered around the edge of the sofa. Bellatrix was supporting \nHermione, who seemed to be unconscious, and was holding her short silver knife to \nHermione\u2019s throat. \n\n\u201cDrop your wands,\u201d she whispered. \u201cDrop them, or we\u2019ll see exactly how filthy \nher blood is!\u201d \n\nRon stood rigid, clutching Wormtail\u2019s wand. Harry straightened up, still holding \nBellatrix\u2019s. \n\n\u201cI said, drop them!\u201d she screeched, pressing the blade into Hermione\u2019s throat: \nHarry saw beads of blood appear there. \n\n\u201cAll right!\u201d he shouted, and he dropped Bellatrix\u2019s wand onto the floor at his feet, \nRon did the same with Wormtail\u2019s. Both raised their hands to shoulder height. \n\n\u201cGood!\u201d she leered. \u201cDraco, pick them up! The Dark Lord is coming, Harry \nPotter! Your death approaches!\u201d \n\nHarry knew it; his scar was bursting with the pain of it, and he could feel \nVoldemort flying through the sky from far away, over a dark and stormy sea, and soon he \nwould be close enough to Apparate to them, and Harry could see no way out. \n\n\u201cNow,\u201d said Bellatrix softly, as Draco hurried back to her with the wands. \u201cCissy, \nI think we ought to tie these little heroes up again, while Greyback takes care of Miss \nMudblood. I am sure the Dark Lord will not begrudge you the girl, Greyback, after what \nyou have done tonight.\u201d \n\nAt the last word there was a peculiar grinding noise from above. All of them \nlooked upward in time to see the crystal chandelier tremble; then, with a creak and an \nominous jingling, it began to fall. Bellatrix was directly beneath it; dropping Hermione, \nshe threw herself aside with a scream. The chandelier crashed to the floor in an explosion \nof crystal and chains, falling on top of Hermione and the goblin, who still clutched the \nsword of Gryffindor. Glittering shards of crystal flew in all directions; Draco doubled \nover, his hands covering his bloody face. \n\n\f\nAs Ron ran to pull Hermione out of the wreckage, Harry took the chance: He \nleapt over an armchair and wrested the three wands from Draco\u2019s grip, pointed all of \nthem at Greyback, and yelled, \u201cStupefy!\u201d The werewolf was lifted off his feet by the \ntriple spell, flew up to the ceiling and then smashed to the ground. \n\nAs Narcissa dragged Draco out of the way of further harm, Bellatrix sprang to her \nfeet, her hair flying as she brandished the silver knife; but Narcissa had directed her wand \nat the doorway. \n\n\u201cDobby!\u201d she screamed and even Bellatrix froze. \u201cYou! You dropped the \nchandelier \u2013 ?\u201d \n\nThe tiny elf trotted into the room, his shaking finger pointing at his old mistress. \n\n\u201cYou must not hurt Harry Potter,\u201d he squeaked. \n\n\u201cKill him, Cissy!\u201d shrieked Bellatrix, but there was another loud crack, and \nNarcissa\u2019s wand too flew into the air and landed on the other side of the room. \n\n\u201cYou dirty little monkey!\u201d bawled Bellatrix. \u201cHow dare you take a witch\u2019s wand, \nhow dare you defy your masters?\u201d \n\n\u201cDobby has no master!\u201d squealed the elf. \u201cDobby is a free elf, and Dobby has \ncome to save Harry Potter and his friends!\u201d \n\nHarry\u2019s scar was blinding him with pain. Dimly he knew that they had moments, \nseconds before Voldemort was with them. \n\n\u201cRon, catch \u2013 and GO!\u201d he yelled, throwing one of the wands to him; then he bent \ndown to tug Griphook out from under the chandelier. Hoisting the groaning goblin, who \nstill clung to the sword, over one shoulder, Harry seized Dobby\u2019s hand and spun on the \nspot to Disapparate. \n\nAs he turned into darkness he caught one last view of the drawing room of the \npale, frozen figures of Narcissa and Draco, of the streak of red that was Ron\u2019s hair, and a \nblue of flying silver, as Bellatrix\u2019s knife flew across the room at the place where he was \nvanishing \u2013 \n\nBill and Fleur\u2019s . . . Shell Cottage . . . Bill and Fleur\u2019s . . . \n\nHe had disappeared into the unknown; all he could do was repeat the name of the \ndestination and hope that it would suffice to take him there. The pain in his forehead \npierced him, and the weight of the goblin bore down upon him; he could feel the blade of \nGryffindor\u2019s sword bumping against his back: Dobby\u2019s hand jerked in his; he wondered \nwhether the elf was trying to take charge, to pull them in the right direction, and tried, by \nsqueezing the fingers, to indicate that that was fine with them. . . . \n\nAnd then they hit solid earth and smelled salty air. Harry fell to his knees, \nrelinquished Dobby\u2019s hand, and attempted to lower Griphook gently to the ground. \n\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he said as the goblin stirred, but Griphook merely whimpered. \n\nHarry squinted around through the darkness. There seemed to be a cottage a short \nway away under the wide starry sky, and he thought he saw movement outside it. \n\n\u201cDobby, is this Shell Cottage?\u201d he whispered, clutching the two wands he had \nbrought from the Malfoys\u2019, ready to fight if he needed to. \u201cHave we come to the right \nplace? Dobby?\u201d \n\nHe looked around. The little elf stood feet from him. \n\n\u201cDOBBY!\u201d \n\nThe elf swayed slightly, stars reflected in his wide, shining eyes. Together, he and \nHarry looked down at the silver hilt of the knife protruding from the elf\u2019s heaving chest. \n\n\f\n\u201cDobby \u2013 no \u2013 HELP!\u201d Harry bellowed toward the cottage, toward the people \nmoving there. \u201cHELP!\u201d \n\nHe did not know or care whether they were wizards or Muggles, friends or foes; \nall he cared about was that a dark stain was spreading across Dobby\u2019s front, and that he \nhad stretched out his own arms to Harry with a look of supplication. Harry caught him \nand laid him sideways on the cool grass. \n\n\u201cDobby, no, don\u2019t die, don\u2019t die \u2013\u201c \n\nThe elf\u2019s eyes found him, and his lips trembled with the effort to form words. \n\n\u201cHarry . . . Potter . . .\u201d \n\nAnd then with a little shudder the elf became quite still, and his eyes were nothing \nmore than great glassy orbs, sprinkled with light from the stars they could not see.\u201d \n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter Twenty-Four \n\nThe Wandmaker \n\n \n\nIt was like sinking into an old nightmare; for an instant Harry knelt again beside \nDumbledore\u2019s body at the foot of the tallest tower at Hogwarts, but in reality he was \nstaring at a tiny body curled upon the grass, pierced by Bellatrix\u2019s silver knife. Harry\u2019s \nvoice was still saying, \u201cDobby\u2026Dobby\u2026\u201d even though he knew that the elf had gone \nwhere he could not call him back. \n\n After a minute or so he realized that they had, after all, come to the right place, for \nhere were Bill and Fleur, Dean and Luna, gathering around him as he knelt over the elf. \n\u201cHermione,\u201d he said suddenly. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d \n\n\u201cRon\u2019s taken her inside,\u201d said Bill. \u201cShe\u2019ll be all right.\u201d Harry looked back down at \nDobby. He stretched out a hand and pulled the sharp blade from the elf\u2019s body, then \ndragged off his own jacket and covered Dobby in it like a blanket. \n\n The sea was rushing against the rock somewhere nearby; Harry listened to it \nwhile the others talked, discussing matters in which he could take no interest, making \ndecisions, Dean carried the injured Griphook into the house, Fleur hurrying with them; \nnow Bill was really knowing what he was saying. As he did so, he gazed down at the \ntiny body, and his scar prickled and burned, and in one part of his mind, viewed as if \nfrom the wrong end of a long telescope, he saw Voldemort punishing those they had left \nbehind at the Malfoy Manor. His rage was dreadful and yet Harry\u2019s grief for Dobby \nseemed to diminish it, so that it became a distant storm that reached Harry from across a \nvast, silent ocean. \n\n\f\n \u201cI want to do it properly,\u201d were the first words of which Harry was fully \nconscious of speaking. \u201cNot by magic. Have you got a spade?\u201d And shortly afterward he \nhad set to work, alone, digging the grave in the place that Bill had shown him at the end \nof the garden, between bushes. He dug with a kind of fury, relishing the manual work, \nglorying in the non-magic of it, for every drop of his sweat and every blister felt like a \ngift to the elf who had saved their lives. \n\n His scar burned, but he was master of the pain, he felt it, yet was apart from it. \nHe had learned control at last, learned to shut his mind to Voldemort, the very thing \nDumbledore had wanted him to learn from Snape. Just as Voldemort had not been able \nto possess Harry while Harry was consumed with grief for Sirius, so his thoughts could \nnot penetrate Harry now while he mourned Dobby. Grief, it seemed, drove Voldemort \nout\u2026though Dumbledore, of course, would have said that it was love. \n\n On Harry dug, deeper and deeper into the hard, cold earth, subsuming his grief in \nsweat, denying the pain in his scar. In the darkness, with nothing but the sound of his \nown breath and the rushing sea to keep him company, the things that had happened at the \nMalfoys\u2019 returned to him, the things he had heard came back to him, and understanding \nblossomed in the darkness\u2026 \n\n The steady rhythm of his arms beat time with his thoughts. \nHallows\u2026Horcruxes\u2026Hallows\u2026Horcruxes\u2026yet no longer burned with that weird, \nobsessive longing. Loss and fear had snuffed it out. He felt as though he had been \nslapped awake again. \n\n Deeper and deeper Harry sank into the grave, and he knew where Voldemort had \nbeen tonight, and whom he had killed in the topmost cell of Nurmengard, and why\u2026 \n\n And he thought of Wormtail, dead because of one small unconscious impulse of \nmercy\u2026Dumbledore had foreseen that\u2026How much more had he known? \n\n Harry lost track of time. He knew only that the darkness had lightened a few \ndegrees when he was rejoined by Ron and Dean. \u201cHow\u2019s Hermione?\u201d \u201cBetter,\u201d said \nRon. \u201cFleur\u2019s looking after her.\u201d Harry had his retort ready for when they asked him \nwhy he had not simply created a perfect grave with his wand, but he did not need it. \nThey jumped down into the hole he had made with spades of their own and together they \nworked in silence until the hole seemed deep enough. \n\n Harry wrapped the elf more snuggly in his jacket. Ron sat on the edge of the \ngrave and stripped off his shoes and socks, which he placed on the elf\u2019s bare feet. Dean \nproduced a woolen hat, which Harry placed carefully upon Dobby\u2019s head, muffling his \nbatlike ears. \u201cWe should close his eyes.\u201d \n\n Harry had not heard the others coming through the darkness. Bill was wearing a \ntraveling cloak, Fleur a large white apron, from the pocket of which protruded a bottle of \nwhat Harry recognized to be Skele-Gro. Hermione was wrapped in a borrowed dressing \ngown, pale and unsteady on her feet; Ron put an arm around her when she reached him. \nLuna, who was huddled in one of Fleur\u2019s coats, crouched down and placed her fingers \ntenderly upon each of the elf\u2019s eyelids, sliding them over his glassy stare. \u201cThere,\u201d she \nsaid softly. \u201cNow he could be sleeping.\u201d \n\n Harry placed the elf into the grave, arranged his tiny limbs so that he might have \nbeen resting, then climbed out and gazed for the last time upon the little body. He forced \nhimself not to break down as he remembered Dumbledore\u2019s funeral, and the rows and \nrows of golden chairs, and the Minister of Magic in the front row, the recitation of \n\n\f\nDumbledore\u2019s achievements, the stateliness of the white marble tomb. He felt that \nDobby deserved just as grand a funeral, and yet here the elf lay between bushes in a \nroughly dug hole. \u201cI think we ought to say something,\u201d piped up Luna. \u201cI\u2019ll go first, \nshall I?\u201d \n\n And as everybody looked at her, she addressed the dead elf at the bottom of the \ngrave. \u201cThank you so much Dobby for rescuing me from that cellar. It\u2019s so unfair that \nyou had to die when you were so good and brave. I\u2019ll always remember what you did for \nus. I hope you\u2019re happy now.\u201d \n\n She turned and looked expectingly at Ron, who cleared his throat and said in a \nthick voice, \u201cyeah\u2026thanks Dobby.\u201d \u201cThanks,\u201d muttered Dean. Harry swallowed. \n\u201cGood bye Dobby,\u201d he said It was all he could manage, but Luna had said it all for him. \nBill raised his wand, and the pile of earth beside the grave rose up into the air and fell \nneatly upon it, a small, reddish mound. \u201cD\u2019ya mind if I stay here a moment?\u201d He asked \nthe others. \n\n They murmured words he did not catch; he felt gentle pats upon his back, and \nthen they all traipsed back toward the cottage, leaving Harry alone beside the elf. \n\n He looked around: There were a number of large white stones, smoothed by the \nsea, marking the edge of the flower beds. He picked up one of the largest and laid it, \npillowlike, over the place where Dobby\u2019s head now rested. He then felt in his pocket for \na wand. There were two in there. He had forgotten, lost track; he could not now \nremember whose wands these were; he seemed to remember wrenching them out of \nsomeone\u2019s hand. He selected the shorter of the two, which felt friendlier in his hand, and \npointed it at the rock. \n\n Slowly, under his murmured instruction, deep cuts appeared upon the rock\u2019s \nsurface. He knew that Hermione could have done it more neatly, and probably more \nquickly, but he wanted to mark the spot as he had wanted to dig the grave. When Harry \nstood up again, the stone read: HERE LIES DOBBY, A FREE ELF. \n\n He looked at his handiwork for a few more seconds, then walked away, his scar \nstill prickling a little, and his mind full of those things that had come to him in the grave, \nideas that had taken shape in the darkness, ideas both fascinating and terrible. \n\n They were all sitting in the living room when he entered the little hall, their \nattention focused upon Bill, who was talking. The room was light-colored, pretty, with a \nsmall fire of driftwood burning brightly in the fireplace. Harry did not want to drop mud \nupon the carpet, so he stood in the doorway, listening. \n\n \u201c\u2026lucky that Ginny\u2019s on holiday. If she\u2019d been at Hogwarts they could have \ntaken her before we reached her. Now we know she\u2019s safe too.\u201d He looked around and \nsaw Harry standing there. \u201cI\u2019ve been getting them all out of the Burrow,\u201d he explained. \n\u201cMoved them to Muriel\u2019s. The Death Eaters know Ron\u2019s with you now, they\u2019re bound to \ntarget the family \u2013don\u2019t apologize,\u201d he added at the sight of Harry\u2019s expression. \u201cIt was \nalways a matter of time, Dad\u2019s been saying so for months. We\u2019re the biggest blood \ntraitor family there is.\u201d \n\n \u201cHow are they protected?\u201d asked Harry. \u201cFidelius Charm. Dad\u2019s Secret-Keeper. \nAnd we\u2019ve done it on this cottage too; I\u2019m Secret-Keeper here. None of us can go to \nwork, but that\u2019s hardly the most important thing now. Once Ollivander and Griphook are \nwell enough, we\u2019ll move them to Muriel\u2019s too. There isn\u2019t much room here, but she\u2019s got \n\n\f\nplenty. Griphook\u2019s legs are on the mend. Fleur\u2019s given him Skele-Gro-we could \nprobably move them in an hour or\u2014\u201c \n\n \u201cNo,\u201d Harry said and Bill looked startled. \u201cI need both of them here. I need to \ntalk to them. It\u2019s important.\u201d He heard the authority of his own voice, the conviction, the \nvoice of purpose that had come to him as he dug Dobby\u2019s grave. All of their faces were \nturned toward him looking puzzled. \n\n \u201cI\u2019m going to wash,\u201d Harry told Bill looking down at his hands still covered with \nmud and Dobby\u2019s blood. \u201cThen I\u2019ll need to see them, straight away.\u201d He walked into the \nlittle kitchen, to the basin beneath a window overlooking the sea. Dawn was breaking \nover the horizon, shell pink and faintly gold, as he washed, again following the train of \nthought that had come to him in the dark garden\u2026 \n\n Dobby would never be able to tell them who had sent him to the cellar, but Harry \nknew what he had seen. A piercing blue eye had looked out of the mirror fragment, and \nthen help had come. Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it. \n\n Harry dried his hands, impervious to the beauty of the scene outside the window \nand to the murmuring of the others in the sitting room. He looked out over the ocean and \nfelt closer, this dawn, than ever before, closer to the heart of it all. \n\n And still his scar prickled, and he knew that Voldemort was getting there too. \nHarry understood and yet did not understand. His instinct was telling him one thing, his \nbrain quite another. The Dumbledore in Harry\u2019s head smiled, surveying Harry over the \ntips of his fingers, pressed together as if in prayer. \n\n You gave Ron the Deluminator\u2026You understood him\u2026You gave him a way \nback\u2026 \n\nAnd you understood Wormtail too\u2026You knew there was a bit of regret there, \nsomewhere\u2026 \n\nAnd if you knew them\u2026What did you know about me, Dumbledore? \n\nAm I meant to know but not to seek? Did you know how hard I\u2019d feel that? Is \nthat why you made it this difficult? So I\u2019d have time to work that out? \n\n Harry stood quite still, eyes glazed, watching the place where a bright gold ray of \ndazzling sun was rising over the horizon. Then he looked down at his clean hands and \nwas momentarily surprised to see the cloth he was holding in them. He set it down and \nreturned to the hall, and as he did so, he felt his scar pulse angrily, and then flashed \nacross his mind, swift as the reflection of a dragonfly over water, the outline of a building \nhe knew extremely well. \n\n Bill and Fleur were standing at the foot of the stairs. \n\n \u201cI need to speak to Griphook and Ollivander,\u201d Harry said. \n\n \u201cNo,\u201d said Fleur. \u201cYou will \u2018ave to wait, \u2018Arry. Zey are both too tired \u2013\u201d \n\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said without heat, \u201cbut it can\u2019t wait. I need to talk to them now. \nPrivately \u2013 and separately. It\u2019s urgent.\u201d \n\n \u201cHarry, what the hell\u2019s going on?\u201d asked Bill. \u201cYou turn up here with a dead \nhouse-elf and a half-conscious goblin, Hermione looks as though she\u2019s been tortured, and \nRon\u2019s just refused to tell me anything \u2013\u201d \n\n \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you what we\u2019re doing,\u201d said Harry flatly. \u201cYou\u2019re in the Order, Bill, \nyou know Dumbledore left us a mission. We\u2019re not supposed to talk about it to anyone \nelse.\u201d \n\n\f\n Fleur made an impatient noise, but Bill did not look at her; he was staring at \nHarry. His deeply scarred face was hard to read. Finally, Bill said, \u201cAll right. Who do \nyou want to talk to first?\u201d \n\n Harry hesitated. He knew what hung on his decision. There was hardly any time \nleft; now was the moment to decide: Horcruxes or Hallows? \n\n \u201cGriphook,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI\u2019ll speak to Griphook first.\u201d \n\n His heart was racing as if he had been sprinting and had just cleared an enormous \nobstacle. \n\n \u201cUp here, then,\u201d said Bill, leading the way. \n\n Harry had walked up several steps before stopping and looking back. \n\n \u201cI need you two as well!\u201d he called to Ron and Hermione, who had been skulking, \nhalf concealed, in the doorway of the sitting room. \n\n They both moved into the light, looking oddly relieved. \n\n \u201cHow are you?\u201d Harry asked Hermione. \u201cYou were amazing \u2013 coming up with \nthat story when she was hurting you like that \u2013\u201d \n\n Hermione gave a weak smile as Ron gave her a one-armed squeeze. \n\n \u201cWhat are we doing now, Harry?\u201d he asked. \n\n \u201cYou\u2019ll see. Come on.\u201d \n\n Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed Bill up the steep stairs onto a small landing. \nThree doors led off it. \n\n \u201cIn here,\u201d said Bill, opening the door into his and Fleur\u2019s room, it too had a view \nof the sea, now flecked with gold in the sunrise. Harry moved to the window, turned his \nback on the spectacular view, and waited, his arms folded, his scar prickling. Hermione \ntook the chair beside the dressing table; Ron sat on the arm. \n\n Bill reappeared, carrying the little goblin, whom he set down carefully upon the \nbed. Griphook grunted thanks, and Bill left, closing the door upon them all. \n\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry to take you out of bed,\u201d said Harry. \u201cHow are your legs?\u201d \n\n \u201cPainful,\u201d replied the goblin. \u201cBut mending.\u201d \n\n He was still clutching the sword of Gryffindor, and wore a strange look: half \ntruculent, half intrigued. Harry noted the goblin\u2019s sallow skin, his long thin fingers, his \nblack eyes. Fleur had removed his shoes: His long feet were dirty. He was larger than a \nhouse-elf, but not by much. His domed head was much bigger than a human\u2019s. \n\n \u201cYou probably don\u2019t remember \u2013\u201d Harry began. \n\n \u201c\u2014that I was the goblin who showed you to your vault, the first time you ever \nvisited Gringotts?\u201d said Griphook. \u201cI remember, Harry Potter. Even amongst goblins, you \nare very famous.\u201d \n\n Harry and the goblin looked at each other, sizing each other up. Harry\u2019s scar was \nstill prickling. He wanted to get through this interview with Griphook quickly, and at the \nsame time was afraid of making a false move. While he tried to decide on the best way to \napproach his request, the goblin broke the silence. \n\n \u201cYou buried the elf,\u201d he said, sounding unexpectedly rancorous. \u201cI watched you \nfrom the window of the bedroom next door.\u201d \n\n \u201cYes,\u201d said Harry. \n\n Griphook looked at him out of the corners of his slanting black eyes. \n\n \u201cYou are an unusual wizard, Harry Potter.\u201d \n\n \u201cIn what way?\u201d asked Harry, rubbing his scar absently. \n\n\f\n \u201cYou dug the grave.\u201d \n\n \u201cSo?\u201d \n\n Griphook did not answer. Harry rather thought he was being sneered at for acting \nlike a Muggle, but it did not matter to him whether Griphook approved of Dobby\u2019s grave \nor not. He gathered himself for the attack. \n\n \u201cGriphook, I need to ask \u2013\u201d \n\n \u201cYou also rescued a goblin.\u201d \n\n \u201cWhat?\u201d \n\n \u201cYou brought me here. Saved me.\u201d \n\n \u201cWell, I take it you\u2019re not sorry?\u201d said Harry a little impatiently. \n\n \u201cNo, Harry Potter,\u201d said Griphook, and with one finger he twisted the thin black \nbeard upon his chin, \u201cbut you are a very odd wizard.\u201d \n\n \u201cRight,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWell, I need some help, Griphook, and you can give it to \nme.\u201d \n\n The goblin made no sign of encouragement, but continued to frown at Harry as \nthough he had never seen anything like him. \n\n \u201cI need to break into a Gringotts vault.\u201d \n\n Harry had not meant to say it so badly: the words were forced from him as pain \nshot through his lightning scar and he saw, again, the outline of Hogwarts. He closed his \nmind firmly. He needed to deal with Griphook first. Ron and Hermione were staring at \nHarry as though he had gone mad. \n\n \u201cHarry \u2013\u201d said Hermione, but she was cut off by Griphook. \n\n \u201cBreak into a Gringotts vault?\u201d repeated the goblin, wincing a little as he shifted \nhis position upon the bed. \u201cIt is impossible.\u201d \n\n \u201cNo, it isn\u2019t,\u201d Ron contradicted him. \u201cIt\u2019s been done.\u201d \n\n \u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThe same day I first met you, Griphook. My birthday, seven \nyears ago.\u201d \n\n \u201cThe vault in question was empty at the time,\u201d snapped the goblin, and Harry \nunderstood that even though Griphook had let Gringotts, he was offended at the idea of \nits defenses being breached. \u201cIts protection was minimal.\u201d \n\n \u201cWell, the vault we need to get into isn\u2019t empty, and I\u2019m guessing its protection \nwill be pretty powerful,\u201d said Harry. \u201cIt belongs to the Lestranges.\u201d \n\n He saw Hermione and Ron look at each other, astonished, but there would be time \nenough to explain after Griphook had given his answer. \n\n \u201cYou have no chance,\u201d said Griphook flatly. \u201cNo chance at all. If you seek \nbeneath our floors, a treasure that was never yours \u2013\u201d \n\n \u201cThief, you have been warned, beware \u2013 yeah, I know, I remember,\u201d said Harry. \n\u201cBut I\u2019m not trying to get myself any treasure, I\u2019m not trying to take anything for \npersonal gain. Can you believe that?\u201d \n\n The goblin looked slantwise at Harry, and the lightning scar on Harry\u2019s forehead \nprickled, but he ignored it, refusing to acknowledge its pain or its invitation. \n\n \u201cIf there was a wizard of whom I would believe that they did not seek personal \ngain,\u201d said Griphook finally, \u201cit would be you, Harry Potter. Goblins and elves are not \nused to the protection or the respect that you have shown this night. Not from wand-\ncarriers.\u201d \n\n\f\n \u201cWand-carriers,\u201d repeated Harry: The phrase fell oddly upon his ears as his scar \nprickled, as Voldemort turned his thoughts northward, and as Harry burned to question \nOllivander next door. \n\n \u201cThe right to carry a wand,\u201d said the goblin quietly, \u201chas long been contested \nbetween wizards and goblins.\u201d \n\n \u201cWell, goblins can do magic without wands,\u201d said Ron. \n\n \u201cThat is immaterial! Wizards refuse to share the secrets of wand-lore with other \nmagical beings, they deny us the possibility of extending our powers!\u201d \n\n \u201cWell, goblins won\u2019t share any of their magic either,\u201d said Ron. \u201cYou won\u2019t tell \nus how to make swords and armor the way you do. Goblins know how to work metal in a \nway wizards have never \u2013\u201d \n\n \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d said Harry, noting Griphook\u2019s rising color. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about \nwizards versus goblins or any other sort of magical creature \u2013\u201d \n\n Griphook gave a nasty laugh. \n\n \u201cBut it is, it is precisely that! As the Dark Lord becomes ever more powerful, \nyour race is set still more firmly above mine! Gringotts falls under Wizarding rule, \nhouse-elves are slaughtered, and who amongst the wand-carriers protests?\u201d \n\n \u201cWe do!\u201d said Hermione. She had sat up straight, her eyes bright. \u201cWe protest! \nAnd I\u2019m hunted quite as much as any goblin or elf, Griphook! I\u2019m a Mudblood!\u201d \n\n \u201cDon\u2019t call yourself \u2013\u201d Ron muttered. \n\n \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I?\u201d said Hermione. \u201cMudblood, and proud of it! I\u2019ve got no \nhigher position under this new order than you have, Griphook! It was me they chose to \ntorture, back at the Malfoys!\u201d \n\n As she spoke, she pulled aside the neck of the dressing gown to reveal the thin cut \nBellatrix had made, scarlet against her throat. \n\n \u201cDid you know that it was Harry who set Dobby free?\u201d she asked. \u201cDid you know \nthat we\u2019ve wanted elves to be freed for years?\u201d (Ron fidgeted uncomfortably on the arm \nof Hermione\u2019s chair.) \u201cYou can\u2019t want You-Know-Who defeated more than we do, \nGriphook!\u201d \n\n The goblin gazed at Hermione with the same curiousity he had shown Harry. \n\n \u201cWhat do you seek within the Lestranges\u2019 vault?\u201d he asked abruptly. \u201cThe sword \nthat lies inside it is a fake. This is the real one.\u201d He looked from one to the other of them. \n\u201cI think that you already know this. You asked me to lie for you back there.\u201d \n\n \u201cBut the fake sword isn\u2019t the only thing in that vault, is it?\u201d asked Harry. \u201cPerhaps \nyou\u2019ve seen other things in there?\u201d \n\n His heart was pounding harder than ever. He redoubled his efforts to ignore the \npulsing of his scar. \n\n The goblin twisted his beard around his finger again. \n\n \u201cIt is against our code to speak of the secrets of Gringotts. We are the guardians \nof fabulous treasures. We have a duty to the objects placed in our care, which were, so \noften, wrought by our fingers.\u201d \n\n The goblin stroked the sword, and his black eyes roved from Harry to Hermione \nto Ron and then back again. \n\n \u201cSo young,\u201d he said finally, \u201cto be fighting so many.\u201d \n\n \u201cWill you help us?\u201d said Harry. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got a hope of breaking in without a \ngoblin\u2019s help. You\u2019re our one chance.\u201d \n\n\f\n \u201cI shall . . . think about it,\u201d said Griphook maddeningly. \n\n \u201cBut \u2013\u201d Ron started angrily; Hermione nudged him in the ribs. \n\n \u201cThank you,\u201d said Harry. \n\n The goblin bowed his great domed head in acknowledgement, then flexed his \nshort legs. \n\n \u201cI think,\u201d he said, settling himself ostentatiously upon Bill and Fleur\u2019s bed, \u201cthat \nthe Skele-Gro has finished its work. I may be able to sleep at last. Forgive me. . . .\u201d \n\n \u201cYeah, of course,\u201d said Harry, but before leaving the room he leaned forward and \ntook the sword of Gryffindor from beside the goblin. Griphook did not protest, but Harry \nthought he saw resentment in the goblin\u2019s eyes as he closed the door upon him. \n\n \u201cLittle git,\u201d whispered Ron. \u201cHe\u2019s enjoying keeping us hanging.\u201d \n\n \u201cHarry,\u201d whispered Hermione, pulling them both away from the door, into the \nmiddle of the still-dark landing, \u201care you saying what I think you\u2019re saying? Are you \nsaying there\u2019s a Horcrux in the Lestranges vault?\u201d \n\n \u201cYes,\u201d said Harry. \u201cBellatrix was terrified when she thought we\u2019d been in there, \nshe was beside herself. Why? What did she think we\u2019d seen, what else did she think we \nmight have taken? Something she was petrified You-Know-Who would find out about.\u201d \n\n \u201cBut I thought we were looking for places You-Know-Who\u2019s been, places he\u2019s \ndone something important?\u201d said Ron, looking baffled. \u201cWas he ever inside the \nLestranges\u2019 vault?\u201d \n\n \u201cI don\u2019t know whether he was ever inside Gringotts,\u201d said Harry. \u201cHe never had \ngold there when he was younger, because nobody left him anything. He would have seen \nthe bank from the outside, though, the first time he ever went to Diagon Alley.\u201d \n\n Harry\u2019s scar throbbed, but he ignored it; he wanted Ron and Hermione to \nunderstand about Gringotts before they spoke to Ollivander. \n\n \u201cI think he would have envied anyone who had a key to a Gringotts vault. I think \nhe\u2019d have seen it as a real symbol of belonging to the Wizarding world. And don\u2019t forget, \nhe trusted Bellatrix and her husband. They were his most devoted servants before he fell, \nand they went looking for him after he vanished. He said it night he came back, I heard \nhim.\u201d \n\n Harry rubbed his scar. \n\n \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019d have told Bellatrix it was a Horcrux, though. He never told \nLucius Malfoy the truth about the diary. He probably told her it was a treasured \npossession and asked her to place it in her vault. The safest place in the world for \nanything you want to hide, Hagrid told me. . . except for Hogwarts.\u201d \n\n When Harry had finished speaking, Ron shook his head. \n\n \u201cYou really understand him.\u201d \n\n \u201cBits of him,\u201d said Harry. \u201cBits . . . I just wish I\u2019d understood Dumbledore as \nmuch. But we\u2019ll see. Come on \u2013 Ollivander now.\u201d \n\n Ron and Hermione looked bewildered but very impressed as they followed him \nacross the little landing and knocked upon the door opposite Bill and Fleur\u2019s. A weak \n\u201cCome in!\u201d answered them. \n\n The wandmaker was lying on the twin bed farthest from the window. He had been \nheld in the cellar for more than a year, and tortured, Harry knew, on at least one occasion. \nHe was emaciated, the bones of his face sticking out sharply against the yellowish skin. \nHis great silver eyes seemed vast in their sunken sockets. The hands that lay upon the \n\n\f\nblanket could have belonged to a skeleton. Harry sat down on the empty bed, beside Ron \nand Hermione. The rising sun was not visible here. The room faced the cliff-top garden \nand the freshly dug grave. \n\n \u201cMr. Ollivander, I\u2019m sorry to disturb you,\u201d Harry said. \n\n \u201cMy dear boy,\u201d Ollivander\u2019s voice was feeble. \u201cYou rescued us, I thought we \nwould die in that place, I can never thank you . . . never thank you . . . enough.\u201d \n\n \u201cWe were glad to do it.\u201d \n\n Harry\u2019s scar throbbed. He knew, he was certain, that there was hardly any time \nleft in which to beat Voldemort to his goal, or else to attempt to thwart him. He felt a \nflutter of panic . . . yet he had made his decision when he chose to speak to Griphook first. \nFeigning a calm he did not feel, he groped in the pouch around his neck and took out the \ntwo halves of his broken wand. \n\n \u201cMr. Ollivander, I need some help.\u201d \n\n \u201cAnything. Anything.\u201d Said the wandmaker weakly. \n\n \u201cCan you mend this? Is it possible?\u201d \n\n Ollivander held out a trembling hand, and Harry placed the two barely connected \nhalves in his palm. \n\n \u201cHolly and phoenix feather,\u201d said Ollivander in a tremulous voice. \u201cEleven inches. \nNice and supple.\u201d \n\n \u201cYes,\u201d said Harry. \u201cCan you -- ?\u201d \n\n \u201cNo,\u201d whispered Ollivander. \u201cI am sorry, very sorry, but a wand that has suffered \nthis degree of damage cannot be repaired by any means that I know of.\u201d \n\n Harry had been braced to hear it, but it was a blow nevertheless. He took the wand \nhalves back and replaced them in the pouch around his neck. Ollivander stared at the \nplace where the shattered wand had vanished, and did not look away until Harry had \ntaken from his pocket the two wands he had brought from the Malfoys\u2019. \n\n \u201cCan you identify these?\u201d Harry asked. \n\n The wandmaker took the first of the wands and held it close to his faded eyes, \nrolling it between his knobble-knuckled fingers, flexing it slightly. \n\n \u201cWalnut and dragon heartstring,\u201d he said. \u201cTwelve-and-three-quarter inches. \nUnyielding. This wand belonged to Bellatrix Lestrange.\u201d \n\n \u201cAnd this one?\u201d \n\n Ollivander performed the same examination. \n\n \u201cHawthorn and unicorn hair. Ten inches precisely. Reasonably springy. This was \nthe wand of Draco Malfoy.\u201d \n\n \u201cWas?\u201d repeated Harry. \u201cIsn\u2019t it still his?\u201d \n\n \u201cPerhaps not. If you took it \u2013\u201d \n\n \u201c\u2014I did \u2013 \u201d \n\n \u201c\u2014then it may be yours. Of course, the manner of taking matters. Much also \ndepends upon the wand itself. In general, however, where a wand has been won, its \nallegiance will change.\u201d \n\n There was a silence in the room, except for the distant rushing of the sea. \n\n \u201cYou talk about wands like they\u2019ve got feelings,\u201d said Harry, \u201clike they can think \nfor themselves.\u201d \n\n \u201cThe wand chooses the wizard,\u201d said Ollivander. \u201cThat much has always been \nclear to those of us who have studied wandlore.\u201d \n\n\f\n \u201cA person can still use a wand that hasn\u2019t chosen them, though?\u201d asked Harry. \n\n \u201cOh yes, if you are any wizard at all you will be able to channel your magic \nthrough almost any instrument. The best results, however, must always come where there \nis the strongest affinity between wizard and wand. These connections are complex. An \ninitial attraction, and then a mutual quest for experience, the wand learning from the \nwizard, the wizard from the wand.\u201d \n\n The sea gushed forward and backward; it was a mournful sound. \n\u201cI took this wand from Draco Malfoy by force,\u201d said Harry. \u201cCan I use it safely?\u201d \n\n \u201cI think so. Subtle laws govern wand ownership, but the conquered wand will \nusually bend its will to its new master.\u201d \n\n \u201cSo I should use this one?\u201d said Ron, pulling Wormtail\u2019s wand out of his pocket \nand handing it to Ollivander. \n\n \u201cChestnut and dragon heartstring. Nine-and-a-quarter inches. Brittle. I was forced \nto make this shortly after my kidnapping, for Peter Pettigrew. Yes, if you won it, it is \nmore likely to do your bidding, and do it well, than another wand.\u201d \n\n \u201cAnd this holds true for all wands, does it?\u201d asked Harry. \n\n \u201cI think so,\u201d replied Ollivander, his protuberant eyes upon Harry\u2019s face. \u201cYou ask \ndeep questions, Mr. Potter. Wandlore is a complex and mysterious branch of magic.\u201d \n\n \u201cSo, it isn\u2019t necessary to kill the previous owner to take the possession of a \nwand?\u201d asked Harry. \n\n Ollivander swallowed. \n\n \u201cNecessary? No, I should not say that it is necessary to kill.\u201d \n\n \u201cThere are legends, though,\u201d said Harry, and as his heart rate quickened, the pain \nin his scar became more intense; he was sure that Voldemort has decided to put his idea \ninto action. \u201cLegends about a wand \u2013 or wands \u2013 that have been passed from hand to \nhand by murder.\u201d \n\n Ollivander turned pale. Against the snowy pillow he was light gray, and his eyes \nwere enormous, bloodshot, and bulging with what looked like fear. \n\n \u201cOnly one wand, I think,\u201d he whispered. \n\n \u201cAnd You-Know-Who is interested in it, isn\u2019t he?\u201d asked Harry. \n\n \u201cI \u2013 how?\u201d croaked Ollivander, and he looked appealingly at Ron and Hermione \nfor help. \u201cHow do you know this?\u201d \n\n \u201cHe wanted you to tell him how to overcome the connection between our wands,\u201d \nsaid Harry. \n\n Ollivander looked terrified. \n\n \u201cHe tortured me, you must understand that! The Cruciatus Curse, I \u2013 I had no \nchoice but to tell him what I knew, what I guessed!\u201d \n\n \u201cI understand,\u201d said Harry. \u201cYou told him about the twin cores? You said he just \nhad to borrow another wizard\u2019s wand?\u201d \n\n Ollivander looked horrified, transfixed, by the amount that Harry knew. He \nnodded slowly. \n\n \u201cBut it didn\u2019t work,\u201d Harry went on. \u201cMine still beat the borrowed wand. Do you \nknow why that is?\u201d \n\n Ollivander shook his head slowly as he had just nodded. \n\n\f\n \u201cI had . . . never heard of such a thing. Your wand performed something unique \nthat night. The connection of the twin cores is incredibly rare, yet why your wand would \nhave snapped the borrowed wand, I do not know. . . . \n\n\u201cWe were talking about the other wand, the wand that changes hands by murder. \nWhen You-Know-Who realized my wand had done something strange, he came back and \nasked about that other wand, didn\u2019t he?\u201d \n\n\u201cHow do you know this?\u201d \n\n Harry did not answer. \n\n \u201cYes, he asked,\u201d whispered Ollivander. \u201cHe wanted to know everything I could \ntell him about the wand variously known as the Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny, or the \nElder Wand.\u201d \n\n Harry glanced sideways at Hermione. She looked flaggergasted. \n\n \u201cThe Dark Lord,\u201d said Ollivander in hushed and frightened tones, \u201chad always \nbeen happy with the wand I made him \u2013 yes and phoenix feather, thirteen-and-a-half \ninches. \u2013 until he discovered the connection of the twin cores. Now he seeks another, \nmore powerful wand, as the only way to conquer yours.\u201d \n\n \u201cBut he\u2019ll know soon, if he doesn\u2019t already, that mine\u2019s broken beyond repair,\u201d \nsaid Harry quietly. \n\n \u201cNo!\u201d said Hermione, sounding frightened. \u201cHe can\u2019t know that, Harry, how \ncould he --?\u201d \n\n\u201cPriori Incantatem,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWe left your wand and the blackthorn wand at \nthe Malfoys\u2019, Hermione. If they examine them properly, make them re-create the spells \nthey\u2019ve cast lately, they\u2019d see that yours broke mine, they\u2019ll see that you tried and failed \nto mend it, and they\u2019ll realize that I\u2019ve been using the blackthorn one ever since.\u201d \n\nThe little color she had regained since their arrival had drained from her face. Ron \ngave Harry a reproachful look, and said, \u201cLet\u2019s not worry about that now ---\u201d \n\nBut Mr. Ollivander intervened. \n\n\u201cThe Dark Lord no longer seeks the Elder Wand only for your destruction, Mr. \nPotter. He is determined to possess it because he believes it will make him truly \ninvulnerable.\u201d \n\n \u201cAnd will it?\u201d \n\n \u201cThe owner of the Elder Wand must always fear attack,\u201d said Ollivander, \u201cbut the \nidea of the Dark Lord in possession of the Deathstick is, I must admit . . . formidable.\u201d \n\n Harry was suddenly reminded of how unsure, when they first met, of how much \nhe like Ollivander. Even now, having been tortured and imprisoned by Voldemort, the \nidea of the Dark Wizard in possession of this wand seemed to enthrall him as much as it \nrepulsed him. \n\n \u201cYou \u2013 you really think this wand exists, then, Mr. Ollivander?\u201d asked Hermione. \n\n \u201cOh yes,\u201d said Ollivander. \u201cYes, it is perfectly possible to trace the wand\u2019s course \nthrough history. There are gaps, of, course, and long ones, where it vanishes from view, \ntemporarily lost or hidden; but always it resurfaces. It has certain identifying \ncharacteristics that those who are learned in wandlore recognize. There are written \naccounts, some of them obscure, that I and other wandmakers have made it our business \nto study. They have the ring of authenticity.\u201d \n\n \u201cSo you \u2013 you don\u2019t think it can be a fairy tale or a myth?\u201d Hermione asked \nhopefully. \n\n\f\n \u201cNo,\u201d said Ollivander. \u201cWhether it needs to pass by murder, I do not know. Its \nhistory is bloody, but that may be simply due to the fact that it is such a desirable object, \nand arouses such passions in wizards. Immensely powerful, dangerous in the wrong \nhands, and an object of incredible fascination to all of us who study the power of wands.\u201d \n\n \u201cMr. Ollivander,\u201d said Harry, \u201cyou told You-Know-Who that Gregorovitch had \nthe Elder Wand, didn\u2019t you?\u201d \n\n Ollivander turned, if possible, even paler. He looked ghostly as he gulped. \n\n \u201cBut how \u2013 how do you -- ?\u201d \n\n \u201cNever mind how I know it,\u201d said Harry, closing his eyes momentarily as his scar \nburned and he saw, for mere seconds, a vision of the main street in Hogsmeade, still dark, \nbecause it was so much farther north. \u201cYou told You-Know-Who that Gregorovitch had \nthe wand?\u201d \n\n \u201cIt was a rumor,\u201d whispered Ollivander. \u201cA rumor, years and years ago, long \nbefore you were born I believe Gregorovitch himself started it. You can see how good it \nwould be for business; that he was studying and duplicating the qualities of the Elder \nWand!\u201d \n\n \u201cYes, I can see that,\u201d said Harry. He stood up. \u201cMr. Ollivander, one last thing, and \nthen we\u2019ll let you get some rest. What do you know about the Deathly Hallows?\u201d \n\n \u201cThe \u2013 the what?\u201d asked the wandmaker, looking utterly bewildered. \n\n \u201cThe Deathly Hallows.\u201d \n\n \u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. Is this still something to do \nwith wands?\u201d \n\n Harry looked into the sunken face and believed that Ollivander was not acting. He \ndid not know about the Hallows. \n\n \u201cThank you,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThank you very much. We\u2019ll leave you to get some \nrest now.\u201d \n\n Ollivander looked stricken. \n\n \u201cHe was torturing me!\u201d he gasped. \u201cThe Cruciatus Curse . . . you have no \nidea. . . .\u201d \n\n \u201cI do,\u201d said Harry, \u201cI really do. Please get some rest. Thank you for telling me all \nof this.\u201d \n\n He led Ron and Hermione down the staircase. Harry caught glimpses of Bill, \nFleur, Luna, and Dean sitting at the table in the kitchen, cups of tea in front of them. They \nall looked up at Harry as he appeared in the doorway, but he merely nodded to them and \ncontinued into the garden, Ron and Hermione behind him. The reddish mound of earth \nthat covered Dobby lay ahead, and Harry walked back to it, as the pain in his head built \nmore and more powerfully. It was a huge effort now to close down the visions that were \nforcing themselves upon him, but he knew that he would have to resist only a little longer. \nHe would yield very soon, because he needed to know that his theory was right. He must \nmake only one more short effort, so that he could explain to Ron and Hermione. \n\n \u201cGregorovitch had the Elder Wand a long time ago,\u201d he said, \u201cI saw You-Know-\nWho trying to find him. When he tracked him down, he found that Gregorovitch didn\u2019t \nhave it anymore: It was stolen from him by Grindelwald. How Grindelwald found out \nthat Gregorovitch had it, I don\u2019t know \u2013 but if Gregorovitch was stupid enough to spread \nthe rumor, it can\u2019t have been that difficult.\u201d \n\n\f\n Voldemort was at the gates of Hogwarts; Harry could see him standing there, and \nsee too the lamp bobbing in the pre-dawn, coming closer and closer. \n\n \u201cAnd Grindelwald used the Elder Wand to become powerful. And at the height of \nhis power, when Dumbledore knew he was the only one who could stop him, he dueled \nGrindelwald and beat him, and he took the Elder Wand.\u201d \n\n \u201cDumbledore had the Elder Wand?\u201d said Ron. \u201cBut then \u2013 where is it now?\u201d \n\n\u201cAt Hogwarts,\u201d said Harry, fighting to remain with them in the cliff-top garden. \n\n \u201cBut then, let\u2019s go!\u201d said Ron urgently. \u201cHarry, let\u2019s go and get it before he \ndoes!\u201d \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s too late for that,\u201d said Harry. He could not help himself, but clutched his \nhead, trying to help it resist. \u201cHe knows where it is. He\u2019s there now.\u201d \n\n \u201cHarry!\u201d Ron said furiously. \u201cHow long have you known this \u2013 why have we \nbeen wasting time? Why did you talk to Griphook first? We could have gone \u2013 we could \nstill go \u2013\u201d \n\n \u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, and he sank to his knees in the grass. \u201cHermione\u2019s right. \nDumbledore didn\u2019t want me to have it. He didn\u2019t want me to take it. He wanted me to get \nthe Horcruxes.\u201d \n\n \u201cThe unbeatable wand, Harry!\u201d moaned Ron. \n\n \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to . . . I\u2019m supposed to get the Horcruxes. . . .\u201d \n\n And now everything was cool and dark: The sun was barely visible over the \nhorizon as he glided alongside Snape, up through the grounds toward the lake. \n\n \u201cI shall join you in the castle shortly,\u201d he said in his high, cold voice. \u201cLeave me \nnow.\u201d \n\n Snape bowed and set off back up the path, his black cloak billowing behind him. \nHarry walked slowly, waiting for Snape\u2019s figure to disappear. It would not do for Snape, \nor indeed anyone else, to see where he was going. But there were no lights in the castle \nwindows, and he could conceal himself . . . and in a second he had cast upon himself a \nDisillusionment Charm that hid him even from his own eyes. \n\n And he walked on, around the edge of the lake, taking in the outlines of the \nbeloved castle, his first kingdom, his birthright. . . . \n\n And here it was, beside the lake, reflected in the dark waters. The white marble \ntomb, an unnecessary blot on the familiar landscape. He felt again that rush of controlled \neuphoria, that heady sense of purpose in destruction. He raised the old yew wand: How \nfitting that this would be its last great act. \n\n The tomb split open from head to foot. The shrouded figure was as long as thin as \nit had been in life. He raised the wand again. \n\n The wrappings fell open. The face was translucent, pale, sunken, yet almost \nperfectly preserved. They had left his spectacles on the crooked nose: He felt amused \nderision. Dumbledore\u2019s hands were folded upon his chest, and there it lay, clutched \nbeneath them, buried with him. \n\n Had the old fool imagined that marble or death would protect the wand? Had he \nthought that the Dark Lord would be scared to violate his tomb? The spiderlike hand \nswooped and pulled the wand from Dumbledore\u2019s grasp, and as he took it, a shower of \nsparks flew from its tip, sparkling over the corpse of its last owner, ready to serve a new \nmaster at last. \n\n \n\n\f\n \n\n \n\nChapter Twenty-Five \n\nShell Cottage \n\n \n\nBill and Fleur's cottage stood alone on a cliff overlooking the sea, its walls embedded \nwith shells and whitewashed. It was a lonely and beautiful place. Wherever Harry went \ninside the tiny cottage or its garden, he could hear the constant ebb and flow of the sea, \nlike the breathing of some great, slumbering creature. He spent much of the next few \ndays making excuses to escape the crowded cottage, craving the cliff-top view of open \nsky and wide, empty sea, and the feel of cold, salty wind on his face. \n\nThe enormity of his decision not to race Voldemort to the wand still scared Harry. He \ncould not remember, ever before, choosing /not/ to act. He was full of doubts, doubts that \nRon could not help voicing whenever they were together. \n\n\"What if Dumbledore wanted us to work out the symbol in time to get the wand?\" \"What \nif working out what the symbol meant made you 'worthy' to get the Hallows?\" \"Harry, if \nthat really is the Elder Wand, how the hell are we supposed to finish off You-Know-\nWho?\" \n\nHarry had no answers: There were moments when he wondered whether it had been \noutright madness not to try to prevent Voldemort breaking open the tomb. He could not \neven explain satisfactorily why he had decided against it: Every time he tried to \nreconstruct the internal arguments that had led to his decision, they sounded feebler to \nhim. \n\nThe odd thing was that Hermione's support made him feel just as confused as Ron's \ndoubts. Now forced to accept that the Elder Wand was real, she maintained that it was an \nevil object, and that the way Voldemort had taken possession of it was repellent, not to be \nconsidered. \n\n\"You could never have done that, Harry,\" she said again and again. \"You couldn't have \nbroken into Dumbledore's grave.\" \n\nBut the idea of Dumbledore's corpse frightened Harry much less than the possibility that \nhe might have misunderstood the living Dumbledore's intentions. He felt that he was still \ngroping in the dark; he had chosen his path but kept looking back, wondering whether he \nhad misread the signs, whether he should not have taken the other way. From time to time, \nanger at Dumbledore crashed over him again, powerful as the waves slamming \nthemselves against the cliff beneath the cottage, anger that Dumbledore had not explained \nbefore he died. \n\n\"But /is/ he dead?\" said Ron, three days after they had arrived at the cottage. Harry had \nbeen staring out over the wall that separated the cottage garden from the cliff when Ron \nand Hermione had found him; he wished they had not, having no wish to join in with \ntheir argument. \n\n\"Yes, he is. Ron, /please\" don't start that again!\" \n\n\"Look at the facts, Hermione,\" said Ron, speaking across Harry, who continued to gaze at \nthe horizon. \"The solve doe. The sword. The eye Harry saw in the mirror --\" \n\n\f\n\"Harry admits he could have imagined the eye! Don't you, Harry?\" \n\n\"I could have,\" said Harry without looking at her. \n\n\"But you don't thing you did, do you?\" asked Ron. \n\n\"No, I don't,\" said Harry. \n\n\"There you go!\" said Ron quickly, before Hermione could carry on. \"If it wasn't \nDumbledore, explain how Dobby knew we were in the cellar, Hermione?\" \n\n\"I can't -- but can you explain how Dumbledore sent him to us if he's lying in a tomb at \nHogwarts?\" \n\n\"I dunno, it could've been his ghost!\" \n\n\"Dumbledore wouldn't come back as a ghost,\" said Harry. There was little about \nDumbledore he was sure of now, but he knew that much. \"He would have gone on.\" \n\n\"What d'you mean, 'gone on'?\" asked Ron, but before Harry could say any more, a voice \nbehind them said, \"'Arry?\" \n\nFleur had come out of the cottage, her long silver hair flying in the breeze. \n\n\"'Arry, Grip'ook would like to speak to you. 'E eez in ze smallest bedroom, 'e says 'e does \nnot want to be over'eard.\" \n\nHer dislike of the goblin sending her to deliver messages was clear; she looked irritable \nas she walked back around the house. \n\nGriphook was waiting for them, as Fleur had said, in the tiniest of the cottage's three \nbedrooms, in which Hermione and Luna slept by night. He had drawn the red cotton \ncurtains against the bright, cloudy sky, which gave the room a fiery glow at odds with the \nrest of the airy, light cottage. \n\n\"I have reached my decision, Harry Potter,\" said the goblin, who was sitting cross-legged \nin a low chair, drumming its arms with his spindly fingers. \"Though the goblins of \nGringotts will consider it base treachery, I have decided to help you --\" \n\n\"That's great!\" said Harry, relief surging through him. \"Griphook, thank you, we're really \n--\" \n\n\"-- in return,\" said the goblin firmly, \"for payment.\" \n\nSlightly taken aback, Harry hesitated. \n\n\"How much do you want? I've got gold.\" \n\n\"Not gold,\" said Griphook. \"I have gold.\" \n\nHis black eyes glittered; there were no whites to his eyes. \n\n\"I want the sword. The sword of Godric Gryffindor.\" \n\nHarry's spirits plummeted. \n\n\"You can't have that,\" he said. \"I'm sorry.\" \n\n\"Then,\" said the goblin softly, \"we have a problem.\" \n\n\"We can give you something else,\" said Ron eagerly. \"I'll bet the Lestranges have got \nloads of stuff, you can take your pick once we get into the vault.\" \n\nHe had said the wrong thing. Griphook flushed angrily. \n\n\"I am not a thief, boy! I am not trying to procure treasures to which I have no right!\" \n\n\"The sword's ours --\" \n\n\"it is not,\" said the goblin. \n\n\"We're Gryffindors, and it was Godric Gryffindor's --\" \n\n\"And before it was Gryffindor's, whose was it?\" demanded the goblin, sitting up straight. \n\n\"No one's,\" said Ron. \"It was made for him, wasn't it?\" \n\n\f\n\"No!\" cried the goblin, bristling with anger as he pointed a long finger at Ron. \n\"Wizarding arrogance again! That sword was Ragnuk the First's, taken from him by \nGodric Gryffindor! It is a _____ _________, a masterpiece of goblinwork! It belongs \nwith the gobl___. The sword is the price of my hire, take it or leave it!\" \n\nGriphook glared at them. Harry glanced at the other ____, then said, \"We need to discuss \nthis, Griphook, if that's all right. Could you give us a few minutes?\" \n\nThe goblin nodded, looking sour. \n\nDownstairs in the empty sitting room, Harry walked to the fireplace, brow furrowed, \ntrying to think what to do. Behind him, Ron said, \"He's having a laugh. We can't let him \nhave that sword.\" \n\n\"It is true?\" Harry asked Hermione. \"Was the sword stolen by Gryffindor?\" \n\n\"I don't know,\" she said hopelessly. \"Wizarding history often skates over what the \nwizards have done to other magical races, but there's no account that I know of that says \nGryffindor stole the sword.\" \n\n\"It'll be one of those goblin stories,\" said Ron, \"about how the wizards are always trying \nto get one over on them. I suppose we should think ourselves lucky he hasn't asked for \none of our wands.\" \n\n\"Goblins have got good reason to dislike wizards, Ron.\" said Hermione. \"They've been \ntreated brutally in the past.\" \n\n\"Goblins aren't exactly fluffy little bunnies, though, are they?\" said Ron. \"They've killed \nplenty of us. They've fought dirty too.\" \n\n\"But arguing with Griphook about whose race is most underhanded and violent isn't \ngoing to make him more likely to help us, is it?\" \n\nThere was a pause while they tried to think of a way around the problem. Harry looked \nout of the window at Dobby's grave. Luna was arranging sea lavender in a jam jar beside \nthe headstone. \n\n\"Okay,\" said Ron, and Harry turned back to face him, \"how's this? We tell Griphook we \nneed the sword until we get inside the _____ and then he can have it. There's a fake in \nthese, isn't there? We switch them, and give him the fake.\" \n\n\"Ron, he'd know the difference better than we would!\" said Hermione. \"He's the only one \nwho realized there had been a swap!\" \n\n\"Yeah, but we could _ca_per before he realizes --\" \n\nHe quailed beneath the look Hermione was giving him. \n\n\"That,\" she said quietly, \"is despicable. Ask for his help, then double-cross him? And you \nwonder why goblins don't like wizards, Ron?\" \n\nRon's ears had turned red. \n\n\"All right, all right! It was the only thing I could think of! What's your solution, then?\" \n\n\"We need to offer him something else, something just as valuable.\" \n\n\"Brilliant, I'll go and get one of our ancient goblin-made swords and you can gift wrap \nit.\" \n\nSilence fell between them again. Harry was sure that the goblin would accept nothing but \nthe sword, even if they had something as valuable to offer him. Yet the sword was their \none, indispensable weapon against the Horcruxes. \n\nHe closed his eyes for a moment or two and listened to the rush of the sea. The idea that \nGryffindor might have stolen the sword was unpleasant to him: He had always been \n\n\f\nproud to be a Gryffindor; Gryffindor had been the champion of Muggle-borns, the wizard \nwho had clashed with the pureblood-loving Slytherin.... \n\n\"Maybe he's lying,\" Harry said, opening his eyes again. \"Griphook. Maybe Gryffindor \ndidn't take the sword. How do we know the goblin version of history's right?\" \n\n\"Does it make a difference?\" asked Hermione. \n\n\"Changes how I feel about it,\" said Harry. \n\nHe took a deep breath. \n\n\"We'll tell him he can have the sword after he's helped us get into that vault -- but we'll be \ncareful to avoid telling him exactly /when/ he can have it.\" \n\nA grin spread slowly across Ron's face. Hermione, however, looked alarmed. \n\n\"Harry, we can't --\" \n\n\"He can have it,\" Harry went on, \"after we've used it on all of the Horcruxes. I'll make \nsure he gets it then. I'll keep my word.\" \n\n\"But that could be years!\" said Hermione. \n\n\"I know that, but /he/ needn't. I won't be lying... really.\" \n\nHarry met her eyes with a mixture of defiance and shame. He remembered the words that \nhad been engraved over the gateway to Nurmengard: FOR THE GREATER GOOD. He \npushed the idea away. What choice did they have? \n\n\"I don't like it,\" said Hermione. \n\n\"Nor do I, much,\" Harry admitted. \n\n\"Well, I think it's genius,\" said Ron, standing up again. \"Let's go and tell him.\" \n\nBack in the smallest bedroom, Harry made the offer, careful to phrase it so as not to give \nany definite time for the handover of the sword. Hermione frowned at the floor while he \nwas speaking; he felt irritated at her, afraid that she might give the game away. However, \nGriphook had eyes for nobody but Harry. \n\n\"I have your word, Harry Potter, that you will give me the sword of Gryffindor if I help \nyou?\" \n\n\"Yes,\" said Harry. \n\n\"Then shake,\" said the goblin, holding out his hand. \n\nHarry took it and shook. He wondered whether those black eyes saw any misgivings in \nhis own. Then Griphook relinquished him, clapped his hands together, and said, \"So. We \nbegin!\" \n\nIt was like planning to break into the Ministry all over again. They settled to work in the \nsmallest bedroom, which was kept, according to Griphook's preference, in semidarkness. \n\n\"I have visited the Lestranges' vault only once,\" Griphook told them, \"on the occasion I \nwas told to place inside it the false sword. It is one of the most ancient chambers. The \noldest Wizarding families store their treasures at the deepest level, where the vaults are \nlargest and best protected....\" \n\nThey remained shut in the cupboardlike room for hours at a time. Slowly the days \nstretched into weeks. There was problem after problem to overcome, not least of which \nwas that their store of Polyjuice Potion was greatly depleted. \n\n\"There's really only enough left for one of us,\" said Hermione, tilting the thick mudlike \npotion against the lamplight. \n\n\"That'll be enough,\" said Harry, who was examining Griphook's hand-drawn map of the \ndeepest passageways. \n\n\f\nThe other inhabitants of Shell Cottage could hardly fail to notice that something was \ngoing on now that Harry, Ron and Hermione only emerged for mealtimes. Nobody asked \nquestions, although Harry often felt Bill's eyes on the three of them at the table, \nthoughtful, concerned. \n\nThe longer they spent together, the more Harry realized that he did not much like the \ngoblin. Griphook was unexpectedly bloodthirsty, laughed at the idea of pain in lesser \ncreatures and seemed to relish the possibility that they might have to hurt other wizards to \nreach the Lestranges' vault. Harry could tell that his distaste was shared by the other two, \nbut they did not discuss it. They needed Griphook. \n\nThe goblin ate only grudgingly with the rest of them. Even after his legs had mended, he \ncontinued to request trays of food in his room, like the still-frail Ollivander, until Bill \n(following an angry outburst from Fleur) went upstairs to tell him that the arrangement \ncould not continue. Thereafter Griphook joined them at the overcrowded table, although \nhe refused to eat the same food, insisting, instead, on lumps of raw meat, roots, and \nvarious fungi. \n\nHarry felt responsible: It was, after all, he who had insisted that the goblin remain at Shell \nCottage so that he could question him; his fault that the whole Weasley family had been \ndriven into hiding, that Bill, Fred, George, and Mr. Weasley could no longer work. \n\n\"I'm sorry,\" he told Fleur, one blustery April evening as he helped her prepare dinner. \"I \nnever meant you to have to deal with all of this.\" \n\nShe had just set some knives to work, chipping up steaks for Griphook and Bill, who had \npreferred his meat bloody ever since he had been attacked by Greyback. While the knives \nsliced behind her, her somewhat irritable expression softened. \n\n\"'Arry, you saved my sister's life, I do not forget.\" \n\nThis was not, strictly speaking, true, but Harry decided against reminding her that \nGabrielle had never been in real danger. \n\n\"Anyway,\" Fleur went on, pointing her want at a pot of sauce on the stove, which began \nto bubble at once, \"Mr. Ollivander leaves for Muriel's zis evening. Zat will make zings \neasier. Ze goblin,\" she scowled a little at the mention of him, \"can move downstairs, and \nyou, Ron, and Dean can take zat room.\" \n\n\"We don't mind sleeping in the living room,\" said Harry, who knew that Griphook would \nthing poorly of having to sleep on the sofa; keeping Griphook happy was essential to \ntheir plans. \"Don't worry about us.\" And when she tried to protest he went on, \"We'll be \noff your hands soon too, Ron, Hermione, and I. We won't need to be here much longer.\" \n\n\"But, what do you mean?\" she said, frowning at him, her wand pointing at the casserole \ndish now suspended in midair. \"Of course you must not leave, you are safe 'ere!\" \n\nShe looked rather like Mrs. Weasley as she said it, and he was glad that the back door \nopened at that moment. Luna and Dean entered, their hair damp from the rain outside and \ntheir arms full of driftwood. \n\n\"... and tiny little ears,\" Luna was saying, \"a bit like hippo's, Daddy says, only purple and \nhairy. And if you want to call them, you have to hum; they prefer a waltz, nothing too \nfast....\" \n\nLooking uncomfortable, Dean shrugged at Harry as he passed, following Luna into the \ncombined dining and sitting room where Ron and Hermione were laying the dinner table. \nSeizing the chance to escape Fleur's questions, Harry grabbed two jugs of pumpkin juice \nand followed them. \n\n\f\n\"... and if you ever come to our house I'll be able to show you the horn, Daddy wrote to \nme about it but I haven't seen it yet, because the Death Eaters took me from the Hogwarts \nExpress and I never got home for Christmas,\" Luna was saying, as she and Dean relit the \nfire. \n\n\"Luna, we told you,\" Hermione called over to her. \"That horn exploded. It came from an \nErumpent, not a Crumple-Horned Snorkack --\" \n\n\"No, it was definitely a Snorkack horn,\" said Luna serenely, \"Daddy told me. It will \nprobably have re-formed by now, they mend themselves, you know.\" \n\nHermione shook her head and continued laying down forks as Bill appeared, leading Mr. \nOllivander down the stairs. The wandmaker still looked exceptionally frail, and he clung \nto Bill's arm as the latter supported him, carrying a large suitcase. \n\n\"I'm going to miss you, Mr. Ollivander,\" said Luna, approaching the old man. \n\n\"And I you, my dear,\" said Ollivander, patting her on the shoulder. \n\n\"You were an inexpressible comfort to me in that terrible place.\" \n\n\"So, au revoir, Mr. Ollivander,\" said Fleur, kissing him on both cheeks. \"And I wonder \nwhezzer you could oblige me by delivering a package to Bill's Auntie Murie!? I never \nreturned 'er tiara.\" \n\n\"It will be an honor,\" said Ollivander with a little bow, \"the very least I can do in return \nfor your generous hospitality.\" \n\nFleur drew out a worn velvet case, which she opened to show the wandmaker. The tiara \nsat glittering and twinkling in the light from the low-hanging lamp. \n\n\"Moonstones and diamonds,\" said Griphook, who had sidled into the room without Harry \nnoticing. \"Made by goblins, I think?\" \n\n\"And paid for by wizards,\" said Bill quietly, and the goblin shot him a look that was both \nfurtive and challenging. \n\nA strong wind gusted against the cottage windows as Bill and Ollivander set off into the \nnight. The rest of them squeezed in around the table; elbow to elbow and with barely \nenough room to move, they started to eat. The fire crackled and popped in the grate \nbeside them. Fleur, Harry noticed, was merely playing with her food; she glanced at the \nwindow every few minutes; however, Bill returned before they had finished their first \ncourse, his long hair tangled by the wind. \n\n\"Everything's fine,\" he told Fleur. \"Ollivander settled in, Mum and Dad say hello. Ginny \nsends you all her love, Fred and George are driving Muriel up the wall, they're still \noperating an Owl-Order business out of her back room. It cheered her up to have her tiara \nback, though. She said she thought we'd stolen it.\" \n\n\"Ah, she eez charmant, your aunt,\" said Fleur crossly, waving her wand and causing the \ndirty plates to rise and form a stack in midair. She caught them and marched out of the \nroom. \n\n\"Daddy's made a tiara,\" piped up Luna, \"Well, more of a crown, really.\" \n\nRon caught Harry's eye and grinned; Harry knew that he was remembering the ludicrous \nheaddress they had seen on their visit to Xenophilius. \n\n\"Yes, he's trying to re-create the lost diadem of Ravenclaw. He thinks he's identified most \nof the main elements now. Adding the billywig wings really made a difference --\" \n\nThere was a bang on the front door. Everyone's head turned toward it. Fleur came \nrunning out of the kitchen, looking frightened; Bill jumped to his feed, his wand pointing \n\n\f\nat the door; Harry, Ron, and Hermione did the same. Silently Griphook slipped beneath \nthe table, out of sight. \n\n\"Who is it?\" Bill called. \n\n\"It is I, Remus John Lupin!\" called a voice over the howling wind. Harry experienced a \nthrill of fear; what had happened? \"I am a werewolf, married to Nymphadora Tonks, and \nyou, the Secret-Keeper of Shell Cottage, told me the address and bade me come in an \nemergency!\" \n\n\"Lupin,\" muttered Bill, and he ran to the door and wrenched it open. \n\nLupin fell over the threshold. He was white-faced, wrapped in a traveling cloak, his \ngraying hair windswept. He straightened up, looked around the room, making sure of \nwho was there, then cried aloud, \"It's a boy! We've named him Ted, after Dora's father!\" \n\nHermione shrieked. \n\n\"Wha --? Tonks -- Tonks has had the baby?\" \n\n\"Yes, yes, she's had the baby!\" shouted Lupin. All around the table came cries of delight, \nsighs of relief: Hermione and Fleur both squealed, \"Congratulations!\" and Ron said, \n\"Blimey, a baby!\" as if he had never heard of such a thing before. \n\n\"Yes -- yes -- a boy,\" said Lupin again, who seemed dazed by his own happiness. He \nstrode around the table and hugged Harry; the scene in the basement of Grimmauld Place \nmight never have happened. \n\n\"You'll be godfather?\" he said as he released Harry. \n\n\"M-me?\" stammered Harry. \n\n\"You, yes, of course -- Dora quite agrees, no one better --\" \n\n\"I -- yeah -- blimey --\" \n\nHarry felt overwhelmed, astonished, delighted; now Bill was hurrying to fetch wine, and \nFleur was persuading Lupin to join them for a drink. \n\n\"I can't stay long, I must get back,\" said Lupin, beaming around at them all: He looked \nyears younger than Harry had ever seen him. \"Thank you, thank you, Bill\" \n\nBill had soon filled all of their goblets, they stood and raised them high in a toast. \n\n\"To Teddy Remus Lupin,\" said Lupin, \"a great wizard in the making!\" \n\n\"'Oo does 'e look like?\" Fleur inquired. \n\n\"I think he looks like Dora, but she thinks he is like me. Not much hair. It looked black \nwhen he was born, but I swear it's turned ginger in the hour since. Probably blond by the \ntime I get back. Andromeda says Tonks's hair started changing color the day that she was \nborn.\" He drained his goblet. \"Oh, go on then, just one more,\" he added, beaming, as Bill \nmade to fill it again. \n\nThe wind buffeted the little cottage and the fire leapt and crackled, and Bill was soon \nopening another bottle of wine. Lupin's news seemed to have taken them out of \nthemselves, removed them for a while from their state of siege: Tidings of new life were \nexhilarating. Only the goblin seemed untouched by the suddenly festive atmosphere, and \nafter a while he slunk back to the bedroom he now occupied alone. Harry thought he was \nthe only one who had noticed this, until he saw Bill's eyes following the goblin up the \nstairs. \n\n\"No... no... I really must get back,\" said Lupin at last, declining yet another goblet of \nwine. He got to his feet and pulled his traveling cloak back around himself. \n\n\"Good-bye, good-bye -- I'll try and bring some pictures in a few day's time -- they'll all be \nso glad to know that I've seen you --\" \n\n\f\nHe fastened his cloak and made his farewells, hugging the women and grasping hands \nwith the men, then, still beaming, returned into the wild night. \n\n\"Godfather, Harry!\" said Bill as they walked into the kitchen together, helping clear the \ntable. \"A real honor! Congratulations!\" \n\nAs Harry set down the empty goblets he was carrying, Bill pulled the door behind him \nclosed, shutting out the still-voluble voices of the others, who were continuing to \ncelebrate even in Lupin's absence. \n\n\"I wanted a private word, actually, Harry. It hasn't been easy to get an opportunity with \nthe cottage this full of people.\" \n\nBill hesitated. \n\n\"Harry, you're planning something with Griphook.\" \n\nIt was a statement, not a question, and Harry did not bother to deny it. He merely looked \nat Bill, waiting. \n\n\"I know goblins,\" said Bill. \"I've worked for Gringotts ever since I left Hogwarts. As far \nas there can be friendship between wizards and goblins, I have goblin friends -- or, at \nleast, goblins I know well, and like.\" Again, Bill hesitated. \n\n\"Harry, what do you want from Griphook, and what have you promised him in return?\" \n\n\"I can't tell you that,\" said Harry. \"Sorry, Bill.\" \n\nThe kitchen door opened behind them; Fleur was trying to bring through more empty \ngoblets. \n\n\"Wait,\" Bill told her, \"Just a moment.\" \n\nShe backed out and he closed the door again. \n\n\"Then I have to say this,\" Bill went on. \"If you have struck any kind of bargain with \nGriphook, and most particularly if that bargain involves treasure, you must be \nexceptionally careful. Goblin notions of ownership, payment, and repayment are not the \nsame as human ones.\" \n\nHarry felt a slight squirm of discomfort, as though a small snake had stirred inside him. \n\n\"What do you mean?\" he asked. \n\n\"We are talking about a different breed of being,\" said Bill. \"Dealings between wizards \nand goblins have been fraught for centuries -- but you'll know all that from History of \nMagic. There has been fault on both sides, I would never claim that wizards have been \ninnocent. However, there is a belief among some goblins, and those at Gringotts are \nperhaps most prone to it, that wizards cannot be trusted in matters of gold and treasure, \nthat they have no respect for goblin ownership.\" \n\n\"I respect --\" Harry began, but Bill shook his head. \n\n\"You don't understand, Harry, nobody could understand unless they have lived with \ngoblins. To a goblin, the rightful and true master of any object is the maker, not the \npurchaser. All goblin made objects are, in goblin eyes, rightfully theirs.\" \n\n\"But it was bought --\" \n\n\"-- then they would consider it rented by the one who had paid the money. They have, \nhowever, great difficulty with the idea of goblin-made objects passing from wizard to \nwizard. You saw Griphook's face when the tiara passed under his eyes. He disapproves. I \nbelieve he thinks, as do the fiercest of his kind, that it ought to have been returned to the \ngoblins once the original purchaser died. They consider our habit of keeping goblin-made \nobjects, passing them from wizard to wizard without further payment, little more than \ntheft.\" \n\n\f\nHarry had an ominous feeling now; he wondered whether Bill guessed more than he was \nletting on. \n\n\"All I am saying,\" said Bill, setting his hand on the door back into the sitting room, \"is to \nbe very careful what you promise goblins, Harry. It would be less dangerous to break into \nGringotts than to renege on a promise to a goblin.\" \n\n\"Right,\" said Harry as Bill opened the door, \"yeah. Thanks. I'll bear that in mind.\" \n\nAs he followed Bill back to the others a wry thought came to him, born no doubt of the \nwine he had drunk. He seemed set on ______ to become just as reckless a godfather to \nTeddy Lupin as Sirius Black had been to him. \n\n \n\nChapter Twenty-Six \n\nGringotts \n\n Their plans were made, their preparations complete; in the smallest bedroom a \nsingle long, coarse black hair (plucked from the sweater Hermione had been wearing at \nMalfoy Manor) lay curled in a small glass phial on the mantelpiece. \n\n \"And you'll be using her actual wand,\" said Harry, nodding toward the walnut \nwand, \"so I reckon you'll be pretty convincing.\" \n\n Hermione looked frightened that the wand might sting or bit her as she picked it \nup. \n\n \"I hate that thing,\" she said in a low voice. \"I really hate it. It feels all wrong, it \ndoesn't work properly for me . . . It's like a bit of her.\" \n\n Harry could not help but remember how Hermione has dismissed his loathing of \nthe blackthorn wand, insisting that he was imagining things when it did not work as well \nas his own, telling him to simply practice. He chose not to repeat her own advice back to \nher, however, the eve of their attempted assault on Gringotts felt like the wrong moment \nto antagonize her. \n\n \"It'll probably help you get in character, though,\" said Ron. \"think what that \nwand's done!\" \n\n \"But that's my point!\" said Hermione. \"This is the wand that tortured Neville's \nmum and dad, and who knows how many other people? This is the wand that killed \nSirius!\" \n\n Harry had not thought of that: He looked down at the wand and was visited by a \nbrutal urge to snap it, to slice it in half with Gryffindor's sword, which was propped \nagainst the wall beside him. \n\n \"I miss my wand,\" Hermione said miserably. \"I wish Mr. Ollivander could have \nmade me another one too.\" \n\n Mr. Ollivander had sent Luna a new wand that morning. She was out on the back \nlawn at that moment, testing its capabilities in the late afternoon sun. Dean, who had lost \nhis wand to the Snatchers, was watching rather gloomily. \n\n Harry looked down at the hawthorn wand that had once belonged to Draco \nMalfoy. He had been surprised, but pleased to discover that it worked for him at least as \nwell as Hermione's had done. Remembering what Ollivander had told them of the secret \n\n\f\nworkings of wands, Harry thought he knew what Hermione's problem was: She had not \nwon the walnut wand's allegiance by taking it personally from Bellatrix. \n\n The door of the bedroom opened and Griphook entered. Harry reached \ninstinctively for the hilt of the sword and drew it close to him, but regretted his action at \nonce. He could tell that the goblin had noticed. Seeking to gloss over the sticky moment, \nhe said, \"We've just been checking the last-minute stuff, Griphook. We've told Bill and \nFleur we're leaving tomorrow, and we've told them not to get up to see us off.\" \n\n They had been firm on this point, because Hermione would need to transform in \nBellatrix before they left, and the less that Bill and Fleur knew or suspected about what \nthey were about to do, the better. They had also explained that they would not be \nreturning. As they had lost Perkin's old tent on the night that the Snatcher's caught them, \nBill had lent them another one. It was now packed inside the beaded bag, which, Harry \nwas impressed to learn, Hermione had protected from the Snatchers by the simple \nexpedient of stuffing it down her sock. \n\n Though he would miss Bill, Fleur, Luna, and Dean, not to mention the home \ncomforts they had enjoyed over the last few weeks, Harry was looking forward to \nescaping the confinement of Shell Cottage. He was tired of trying to make sure that they \nwere not overheard, tired of being shut in the tiny, dark bedroom. Most of all, he longed \nto be rid of Griphook. However, precisely how and when they were to part from the \ngoblin without handing over Gryffindor's sword remained a question to which Harry had \nno answer. It had been impossible to decide how they were going to do it, because the \ngoblin rarely left Harry, Ron, and Hermione alone together for more than five minutes at \na time: \"He could give my mother lessons,\" growled Ron, as the goblin's long fingers \nkept appearing around the edges of doors. With Bill's warning in mind, Harry could not \nhelp suspecting that Griphook was on the watch for possible skullduggery. Hermione \ndisapproved so heartily of the planned double-cross that Harry had given up attempting to \npick her brains on how best to do it: Ron, on the rare occasions that they had been able to \nsnatch a few Griphook-free moments, had come up with nothing better than \"We'll just \nhave to wing it, mate.\" \n\n Harry slept badly that night. Lying away in the early hours, he thought back to the \nway he had felt the night before they had infiltrated the Ministry of Magic and \nremembered a determination, almost an excitement. Now he was experiencing jolts of \nanxiety nagging doubts: He could not shake off the fear that it was all going to go wrong. \nHe kept telling himself that their plan was good, that Griphook knew what they were \nfacing, that they were well-prepared for all the difficulties they were likely to encounter, \nyet still he felt uneasy. Once or twice he heard Ron stir and was sure that he too was \nawake, but they were sharing the sitting room with Dean, so Harry did not speak. \n\n It was a relief when six o-clock arrived and they could slip out of their sleeping \nbags, dress in the semidarkness, then creep out into the garden, where they were to meet \nHermione and Griphook. The dawn was chilly, but there was little wind now that it was \nMay. Harry looked up at the stars still glimmering palely in the dark sky and listened to \nthe sea washing backward and forward against the cliff: He was going to miss the sound. \n\n Small green shoots were forcing their way up through the red earth of Dobby's \ngrave now, in a year's time the mound would be covered in flowers. The white stone that \nbore the elf's name had already acquired a weathered look. He realized now that they \ncould hardly have laid Dobby to rest in a more beautiful place, but Harry ached with \n\n\f\nsadness to think of leaving him behind. Looking down on the grave, he wondered yet \nagain how the elf had known where to come to rescue them. His fingers moved \nabsentmindedly to the little pouch still strung around his neck, thorough which he could \nfeel the jagged mirror fragment in which he had been sure he had seen Dumbledore's eye. \nThen the sound of a door opening made him look around. \n\n Bellatrix Lestrange was striding across the lawn toward them, accompanied by \nGriphook. As she walked, she was tucking the small, beaded bag into the inside pocket of \nanother set of the old robes they had taken from Grimmauld Place. Though Harry knew \nperfectly well that it was really Hermione, he could not suppress a shiver of loathing. She \nwas taller than he was, her long black hair rippling down her back, her heavily lidded \neyes disdainful as they rested upon him; but then she spoke, and he heard Hermione \nthrough Bellatrix's low voice. \n\n \"She tasted disgusting, worse than Gurdyroots! Okay, Ron, come here so I can do \nyou . . .\" \n\n \"right, but remember, I don't like the beard too long\" \n\n \"Oh, for heaven's sake, this isn't about looking handsome\" \n\n \"It's not that, it gets in the way! But I liked my nose a bit shorter, try and do it the \nway you did last time.\" \n\n Hermione sighed and set to work, muttering under her breath as she transformed \nvarious aspects of Ron's appearance. He was to be given a completely fake identity, and \nthey were trusting to the malevolent aura cast by Bellatrix to protect him. Meanwhile \nHarry and Griphook were to be concealed under the Invisibility Cloak. \n\n \"There,\" said Hermione, \"how does he look, Harry?\" \n\n It was just not possible to discern Ron under his disguise, but only, Harry thought \nbecause he knew him so well. Ron's hair was now long and wavy; he had a thick brown \nbeard and mustache, no freckles, a short, broad nose, and heavy eyebrows. \n\n \"Well, he's not my type, but he'll do,\" said Harry. \"Shall we go, then?\" \n\n All three of them glanced back at Shell Cottage, lying dark and silent under the \nfading stars, then turned and began to walk toward the point, just beyond the boundary \nwall, where the Fidelius Chard stopped working and they would be able to Disapparate. \nOnce past the gate, Griphook spoke. \n\n \"I should climb up now, Harry Potter, I think?\" \n\n Harry bent down and the goblin clambered onto his back, his hands linked on \nfront of Harry's throat. He was not heavy, but Harry disliked the feeling of the goblin and \nthe surprising strength with which he clung on. Hermione pulled the Invisibility Cloak \nout of the beaded bag and threw it over them both. \n\n \"Perfect,\" she said, bending down to check Harry's feet. \"I can't see a thing. Let's \ngo.\" \n\n Harry turned on the spot, with Griphook on his shoulders, concentrating with all \nhis might on the Leaky Cauldron, the inn that was the entrance to Diagon Alley. The \ngoblin clung even tighter as they moved into the compressing darkness, and seconds later \nHarry's feet found pavement and he opened his eyes on Charing Cross Road. Muggles \nbustled past wearing the hangdog expressions of early morning, quite unconscious of the \nlittle inn's existence. \n\n The bar of the Leaky Cauldron was nearly deserted. Ton, the stooped and \ntoothless landlord, was polishing glasses behind the bar counter; a couple of warlocks \n\n\f\nhaving a muttered conversation in the far corner glanced at Hermione and drew back into \nthe shadows. \n\n \"Madam Lestrange,\" murmured Tom, and as Hermione paused he inclined his \nhead subserviently. \n\n \"Good morning,\" said Hermione, and as Harry crept past, still carrying Griphook \npiggyback under the Cloak, he saw Tom look surprised. \n\n \"Too polite,\" Harry whispered in Hermione's ear as they passed out of the Inn into \nthe tiny backyard. \"You need to treat people like they're scum!\" \n\n \"Okay, okay!\" \n\n Hermione drew out Bellatrix's wand and rapped a brick in the nondescript wall in \nfront of them. At once the bricks began to whirl and spin: A hole appeared in the middle \nof them, which grew wider and wider, finally forming an archway onto the narrow \ncobbled street that was Diagon Alley. \n\n It was quiet, barely time for the shops to open, and there were hardly and \nshoppers abroad. The crooked, cobbled street was much altered now from the bustling \nplace Harry had visited before his first team at Hogwarts so many years before. More \nshops than ever were boarded up, though several new establishments dedicated to the \nDark Arts had been created since his last visit. Harry's own face glared down at him from \nposters plastered over many windows, always captioned with the words UNDESIRABLE \nNUMBER ONE. \n\n A number of ragged people sat huddled in doorways. He heard them moaning to \nthe few passersby, pleading for gold, insisting that they were really wizards. One man \nhad a bloody bandage over his eye. \n\n As they set off along the street, the beggars glimpsed Hermione. they seemed to \nmelt away before her, drawing hoods over their faces and fleeing as fast as they could. \nHermione looked after them curiously, until the man with the bloodied bandage came \nstaggering right across her path. \n\n \"My children,\" he bellowed, pointing at her. His voice was cracked, high-pitched, \nhe sounded distraught. \"Where are my children? What has he done with them? You know, \nyou know!\" \n\n \"I--I really--\" stammered Hermione. \n\n The man lunged at her, reaching for her throat. Then, with a bang and a burst of \nred light he was thrown backward onto the ground, unconscious. Ron stood there, his \nwand still outstretched and a look of shock visible behind his beard. Faces appeared at the \nwindows on either side of the street, while a little knot of prosperous-looking passerby \ngathered their robes about them and broke into gentle trots, keen to vacate the scene. \n\n their entrance into Diagon Alley could hardly have been more conspicuous; for a \nmoment Harry wondered whether it might not be better to leave now and try to think of a \ndifferent plan. Before they could move or consult one another, however, they heard a cry \nfrom behind them. \n\n \"Why, Madam Lestrange!\" \n\n Harry whirled around and Griphook tightened his hold around Harry's neck: A tall, \nthink wizard with a crown of bushy gray hair and a long, sharp nose was striding toward \nthem. \n\n\f\n \"It's Travers,\" hissed the goblin into Harry's ear, but at that moment Harry could \nnot think who Travers was. Hermione had drawn herself up to full height and said with as \nmuch contempt as she could muster: \n\n \"And what do you want?\" \n\n Travers stopped in his tracks, clearly affronted. \n\n \"He's another Death Eater!\" breathed Griphook, and Harry sidled sideways to \nrepeat the information into Hermione's ear. \n\n \"I merely sought to greet you,\" said Travers coolly, \"but if my presence is not \nwelcome . . .\" \n\n Harry recognized his voice now: Travers was one of the Death Eaters who had \nbeen summoned to Xenophilius\u2019s house. \n\n \"No, no, not at all, Travers,\" said Hermione quickly, trying to cover up her \nmistake. \"How are you?\" \n\n \"Well, I confess I am surprised to see you out and about, Bellatrix.\" \n\n \"Really? Why?\" asked Hermione. \n\n \"Well,\" Travers coughed, \"I heard that the Inhabitants of Malfoy Manor were \nconfined to the house, after the . . . ah . . . escape.\" \n\n Harry willed Hermione to keep her head. If this was true, and Bellatrix was not \nsupposed to be out in public-- \n\n \"The Dark Lord forgives those who have served him most faithfully in the past,\" \nsaid Hermione in a magnificent imitation of Bellatrix's most contemptuous manner. \n\"Perhaps your credit is not as good with him as mine is, Travers.\" \n\n Though the Death Eater looked offended, he also seemed less suspicious. He \nglanced down at the man Ron had just Stunned. \n\n \"How did it offend you?\" \n\n \"It does not matter, it will not do so again,\" said Hermione coolly. \n\n \"Some of these wandless can be troublesome,\" said Travers. \"While they do \nnothing but beg I have no objection, but one of them actually asked me to plead her case \nin the Ministry last week. 'I'm a witch, sir, I'm a witch, let me prove it to you!\" he said in \na squeaky impersonation. \"As if I was going to give her my wand--but whose wand,\" said \nTravers curiously, \"are you using at the moment, Bellatrix? I heard that your own was--\" \n\n \"I have my wand here,\" said Hermione coldly, holding up Bellatrix's wand. \"I \ndon't know what rumors you have been listening to, Travers, but you seem sadly \nmisinformed.\" \n\n Travers seemed a little taken aback at that, and he turned instead to Ron. \n\n \"Who is your friend? I do not recognize him.\" \n\n \"This is Dragomir Despard,\" said Hermione; they had decided that a fictional \nforeigner was the safest cover for Ron to assume. \"He speaks very little English, but he is \nin sympathy with the Dark Lord's aims. He has traveled here from Transylvania to see \nour new regime.\" \n\n \"Indeed? How do you do, Dragomir?\" \n\n \"'Ow you?\" said Ron, holding out his hand. \n\n Travers extended two fingers and shook Ron's hand as though frightened of \ndirtying himself. \n\n So what brings you and your--ah--sympathetic friend to Diagon Alley this early?\" \nasked Travers. \n\n\f\n \"I need to visit Gringotts,\" said Hermione. \n\n \"Alas, I also,\" said Travers. \"Gold, filthy gold! We cannot live without it, yet I \nconfess I deplore the necessity of consorting with our long-fingered friends.\" \n\n Harry felt Griphook's clasped hands tighten momentarily around his neck. \n\n \"Shall we?\" said Travers, gesturing Hermione forward. \n\n Hermione had no choice but to fall into step beside him and head along the \ncrooked, cobbled street toward the place where the snowy-white Gringotts stood towering \nover the other little shops. Ron sloped along beside them, and Harry and Griphook \nfollowed. \n\n A watchful Death Eater was the very last thing they needed, and the worst of it \nwas, with Travers matching at what he believed to be Bellatrix's side, there was no means \nfor Harry to communicate with Hermione or Ron. All too soon they arrived at the foot of \nthe marble steps leading up to the great bronze doors. As Griphook had already warned \nthem, the liveried goblins who usually flanked the entrance had been replaced by two \nwizards, both of whom were clutching long thin golden rods. \n\n \"Ah, Probity Probes,\" signed Travers theatrically, \"so crude--but so effective!\" \n\n And he set off up the steps, nodding left and right to the wizards, who raised the \ngolden rods and passed them up and down his body. The Probes, Harry knew, detected \nspells of concealment and hidden magical objects. Knowing that he had only seconds, \nHarry pointed Draco's wand at each of the guards in turn and murmured, \"Confundo\" \ntwice. Unnoticed by Travers, who was looking through the bronze doors at the inner hall, \neach of the guards gave a little start as the spells hit them. \n\n Hermione's long black hair rippled behind her as she climbed the steps. \n\n \"One moment, madam,\" said the guard, raising his Probe. \n\n \"But you've just done that!\" said Hermione in Bellatrix's commanding, arrogant \nvoice. Travers looked around, eyebrows raised. The guard was confused. He stared down \nat the thin golden Probe and then at his companion, who said in a slightly dazed voice, \n\n \"Yeah, you've just checked them, Marius.\" \n\n Hermione swept forward. Ron by her side, Harry and Griphook trotting invisibly \nbehind them. Harry glanced back as they crossed the threshold. The wizards were both \nscratching their heads. \n\n Two goblins stood before the inner doors, which were made of silver and which \ncarried the poem warning of dire retribution to potential thieves. Harry looked up at it, \nand all of a sudden a knife-sharp memory came to him: standing on this very spot on the \nday that he had turned eleven, the most wonderful birthday of his life, and Hagrid \nstanding beside him saying, \"Like I said, yeh'd be mad ter try an' rob it.\" Gringotts had \nseemed a place of wonder that day, the enchanted repository of a trove of gold he had \nnever known he possessed, and never for an instant could he have dreamed that he would \nreturn to steal . . . But within seconds they were standing in the vast marble hall of the \nbank. \n\n The long counter was manned by goblins sitting on high stools serving the first \ncustomers of the day. Hermione, Ron, and Travers headed toward an old goblin who was \nexamining a thick gold coin through an eyeglass. Hermione allowed Travers to step \nahead of her on the pretext of explaining features of the hall to Ron. \n\n\f\n The goblin tossed the coin he was holding aside, said to nobody in particular, \n\"Leprechaun,\" and then greeted Travers, who passed over a tiny golden key, which was \nexamined and given back to him. \n\n Hermione stepped forward. \n\n \"Madam Lestrange!\" said the goblin, evidently startled. \"Dear me!\" How--how \nmay I help you today?\" \n\n \"I wish to enter my vault,\" said Hermione. \n\n The old goblin seemed to recoil a little. Harry glanced around. Not only was \nTravers hanging back, watching, but several other goblins had looked up from their work \nto stare at Hermione. \n\n \"You have . . . identification?\" asked the goblin. \n\n \"Identification? I--I have never been asked for identification before!\" said \nHermione. \n\n \"They know!\" whispered Griphook in Harry's ear, \"They must have been warned \nthere might be an imposter!\" \n\n \"Your wand will do, madam,\" said the goblin. He held out a slightly trembling \nhand, and in a dreadful blast of realization Harry knew that the goblins of Gringotts were \naware that Bellatrix's wand had been stolen. \n\n \"Act now, act now,\" whispered Griphook in Harry's ear, \"the Imperious Curse!\" \n\n Harry raised the hawthorn wand beneath the cloak, pointed it at the old goblin, \nand whispered, for the first time in his life, \"Imperio!\" \n\n A curious sensation shot down Harry's arm, a feeling of tingling, warmth that \nseemed to flow from his mind, down the sinews and veins connecting him to the wand \nand the curse it had just cast. The goblin took Bellatrix's wand, examined it closely, and \nthen said, \"Ah, you have had a new wand made, Madam Lestrange!\" \n\n \"What?\" said Hermione, \"No, no, that's mine--\" \n\n \"A new wand?\" said Travers, approaching the counter again; still the goblins all \naround were watching. \"But how could you have done, which wandmaker did you use?\" \n\n Harry acted without thinking. Pointing his wand at Travers, he muttered, \n\"Imperio!\" once more. \n\n \"Oh yes, I see,\" said Travers, looking down at Bellatrix's wand, \"yes, very \nhandsome. and is it working well? I always think wands require a little breaking in, don't \nyou?\" \n\n Hermione looked utterly bewildered, but to Harry's enormous relief she accepted \nthe bizarre turn of events without comment. \n\n The old goblin behind the counter clapped his hands and a younger goblin \napproached. \n\n \"I shall need the Clankers,\" he told the goblin, who dashed away and returned a \nmoment later with a leather bag that seemed to be full of jangling metal, which he handed \nto his senior. \"Good, good! S, if you will follow me, Madam Lestrange,\" said the old \ngoblin, hopping down off his stool and vanishing from sight. \"I shall take you to your \nvault.\" \n\n He appeared around the end of the counter, jogging happily toward them, the \ncontents of the leather bag still jingling. Travers was now standing quite still with his \nmouth hanging wide open. Ron was drawing attention to this odd phenomenon by \nregarding Travers with confusion. \n\n\f\n \u201cWait \u2013 Bogrod!\u201d \n\n Another goblin came scurrying around the counter. \n\n \u201cWe have instructions,\u201d he said with a bow to Hermione. \u201cForgive me, Madam, \nbut there have been special orders regarding the vault of Lestrange.\u201d \n\n He whispered urgently in Bogrod\u2019s ear, but the Imperiused goblin shook him off. \n\n \u201cI am aware of the instructions, Madam Lestrange wishes to visit her vault \u2026 \nVery old family \u2026 old clients \u2026 This way, please \u2026 \u201c \n\n And, still clanking, he hurried toward one of the many doors leading off the hall. \nHarry looked back at Travers , who was still rooted to the spot looking abnormally vacant, \nand made his decision. With a flick of his wand he made Travers come with them, \nwalking meekly in their wake as they reached the door and passed into the rough stone \npassageway beyond, which was lit with flaming torches. \n\n \u201cWe\u2019re in trouble; they suspect,\u201d said Harry as the door slammed behind them \nand he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak. Griphook jumped down from his shoulders: \nneither Travers nor Bogrod showed the slightest surprise at the sudden appearance of \nHarry Potter in their midst. \u201cThey\u2019re Imperiused,\u201d he added, in response to Hermione and \nRon\u2019s confused queries about Travers and Bogrod, who were both now standing there \nlooking blank. \u201cI don\u2019t think I did it strongly enough, I don\u2019t know \u2026\u201d \n\n And another memory darted through his mind, of the real Bellatrix Lestrange \nshrieking at him when he had first tried to use an Unforgivable Curse: \u201cYou need to mean \nthem, Potter!\u201d \n\n \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d asked Ron. \u201cShall we get out now, while we can?\u201d \n\n \u201cIf we can,\u201d said Hermione, looking back toward the door into the main hall, \nbeyond which who knew what was happening. \n\n \u201cWe\u2019ve got this far, I say we go on,\u201d said Harry. \n\n \u201cGood!\u201d said Griphook. \u201cSo, we need Bogrod to control the cart; I no long have \nthe authority. But there will not be room for the wizard.\u201d \n\n Harry pointed his wand at Travers. \n\n \u201cImperio!\u201d \n\n The wizard turned and set off along the dark track at a smart pace. \n\n \u201cWhat are you making him do?\u201d \n\n \u201cHide,\u201d said Harry as he pointed his wand at Bogrod, who whistled to summon a \nlittle cart that came trundling along the tracks toward them out of the darkness. Harry was \nsure he could hear shouting behind them in the main hall as they all clambered into it, \nBogrod in front of Griphook, Harry, Ron, and Hermione crammed together in the back. \n\n With a jerk the cart moved off, gathering speed: They hurried past Travers, who \nwas wriggling into a crack in the wall, then the cart began twisting and turning through \nthe labyrinthine passages, sloping downward all the time. Harry could not hear anything \nover the rattling of the cart on the tracks: His hair flew behind him as they swerved \nbetween stalactites, flying ever deeper into the earth, but he kept glancing back. They \nmight as well have left enormous footprints behind them; the more he thought about it, \nthe more foolish it seemed to have disguised Hermione as Bellatrix, to have brought \nalong Bellatrix\u2019s wand, when the Death Eaters knew who had stolen it \u2013 \n\n There were a deeper than Harry had ever penetrated within Gringotts; they took a \nhairpin bend at speed and saw ahead of them, with seconds to spare, a waterfall pounding \nover the track. Harry heard Griphook shout, \u201cNo!\u201d but there was no braking. They \n\n\f\nzoomed through it. Water filled Harry\u2019s eyes and mouth: He could not see or breathe: \nThen, with an awful lurch, the cart flipped over and they were all thrown out of it. Harry \nheard the cart smash into pieces against the passage wall, heard Hermione shriek \nsomething, and felt himself glide back toward the ground as though weightless, landing \npainlessly on the rocky passage floor. \n\n \u201cC-Cushioning Charm,\u201d Hermione spluttered, as Ron pulled her to her feet, but to \nHarry\u2019s horror he saw that she was no longer Bellatrix; instead she stood there in \noverlarge robes, sopping wet and completely herself; Ron was red-haired and beardless \nagain. They were realizing it as they looked at each other, feeling their own faces. \n\n \u201cThe Thief\u2019s Downfall!\u201d said Griphook, clambering to his feet and looking back \nthe deluge onto the tracks, which, Harry knew now, had been more than water. \u201cIt washes \naway all enchantment, all magical concealment! They know there are imposers in \nGringotts, they have set off defenses against us!\u201d \n\n Harry saw Hermione checking that she still had the beaded bag, and hurriedly \nthrust his own hand under his jacket to make sure he had not lost the Invisibility Cloak. \nThen he turned to see Bogrod shaking his head in bewilderment: The Thief\u2019s Downfall \nseemed to have lifted his Imperius Curse. \n\n \u201cWe need him,\u201d said Griphook, \u201cwe cannot enter the vault without a Gringott\u2019s \ngoblin. And we need the clankers!\u201d \n\n \u201cImperio!\u201d Harry said again; his voice echoed through the stone passage as he felt \nagain the sense of heady control that flowed from brain to wand. Bogrod submitted once \nmore to his will, his befuddled expression changing to one of polite indifference, as Ron \nhurried to pick up the leather bag of metal tools. \n\n \u201cHarry, I think I can hear people coming!\u201d said Hermione, and she pointed \nBellatrix\u2019s wand at the waterfall and cried, \u201cProtego!\u201d They saw the Shield Charm break \nthe flow of enchanted water as it flew up the passageway. \n\n \u201cGood thinking,\u201d said Harry. \u201cLead the way, Griphook!\u201d \n\n \u201cHow are we going to get out again?\u201d Ron asked as they hurried on foot into the \ndarkness after the goblin, Bogrod panting in their wake like an old dog. \n\n \u201cLet\u2019s worry about that when we have to,\u201d said Harry. He was trying to listen: He \nthought he could hear something clanking and moving around nearby. \u201cGriphook, how \nmuch farther?\u201d \n\n \u201cNot far, Harry Potter, not far \u2026 \u201c \n\n And they turned a corner and saw the thing for which Harry had been prepared, \nbut which still brought all of them to a halt. \n\n A gigantic dragon was tethered to the ground in front of them, barring access to \nfour or five of the deepest vaults in the place. The beast\u2019s scales had turned pale and flaky \nduring its long incarceration under the ground, its eyes were milkily pink; both rear legs \nbore heavy cuffs from which chains led to enormous pegs driven deep into the rocky \nfloor. Its great spiked wings, folded close to its body, would have filled the chamber if it \nspread them, and when it turned its ugly head toward them, it roared with a noise that \nmade the rock tremble, opened its mouth, and spat a jet of fire that sent them running \nback up the passageway. \n\n \u201cIt is partially blind,\u201d panted Griphook, \u201cbut even more savage for that. However, \nwe have the means to control it. It has learned what to expect when the Clankers come. \nGive them to me.\u201d \n\n\f\n Ron passed the bag to Griphook, and the goblin pulled out a number of small \nmetal instruments that when shaken made a long ringing noise like miniature hammers on \nanvils. Griphook handed them out: Bogrod accepted his meekly. \n\n \u201cYou know what to do,\u201d Griphook told Harry, Ron, and Hermione. \u201cIt will expect \npain when it hears the noise. It will retreat, and Bogrod must place his palm upon the \ndoor of the vault.\u201d \n\n They advanced around the corner again, shaking the Clankers, and the noise \nechoed off the rocky walls, grossly magnified, so that the inside of Harry\u2019s skull seemed \nto vibrate with the den. The dragon let out another hoarse roar, then retreated. Harry \ncould see it trembling, and as they drew nearer he saw the scars made by vicious slashes \nacross its face, and guess that it had been taught to fear hot swords when it heard the \nsound of the Clankers. \n\n \u201cMake him press his hand to the door!\u201d Griphook urged Harry, who turned his \nwand again upon Bogrod. The old goblin obeyed, pressing his palm to the wood, and the \ndoor of the vault melted away to reveal a cavelike opening crammed from floor to ceiling \nwith golden coins and goblets, silver armor, the skins of strange creatures \u2013 some with \nlong spines, other with drooping wings \u2013 potions in jeweled flasks, and a skull still \nwearing a crown. \u201cSearch, fast!\u201d said Harry as they all hurried inside the vault. He had \ndescribed Hufflepuff\u2019s cap to Ron and Hermione, but if it was the other, unknown \nHorcrux that resided in this vault, he did not know what it looked like. He barely had \ntime to glance around, however, before there was a muffled clunk from behind them: The \ndoor had reappeared, sealing them inside the vault, and they were plunged into total \ndarkness. \n\n \u201cNo matter, Bogrod will be able to release us!\u201d said Griphook as Ron gave a \nshout of surprise. \u201cLight your wands, can\u2019t you? And hurry, we have little time!\u201d \n\n \u201cLumos!\u201d \n\n Harry shone his lit wand around the vault: Its beam fell upon glittering jewels; he \nsaw the fake sword of Gryffindor lying on a high shelf amongst a jumble of chains. Ron \nand Hermione had lit their wands too, and were now examining the piles of objects \nsurrounding them. \n\n \u201cHarry, could this be -- ? Aargh!\u201d \n\n Hermione screamed in pain, and Harry turned his wand on her in time to see a \njeweled goblet tumbling from her grip. But as it fell, it split, became a shower of goblets, \nso that a second later, with a great clatter, the floor was covered in identical cups rolling \nin every direction, the original impossible to discern amongst them. \n\n \u201cIt burned me!\u201d moaned Hermione, sucking her blistered fingers. \n\n \u201cThey have added Germino and Flagrante Curses!\u201d said Griphook. \n\n \u201cEverything you touch will burn and multiply, but the copies are worthless \u2013 and \nif you continue to handle the treasure, you will eventually be crushed to death by the \nweight of expanding gold!\u201d \n\n \u201cOkay, don\u2019t touch anything!\u201d said Harry desperately, but even as he said it, Ron \naccidentally nudged one of the fallen goblets with his foot, and twenty more exploded \ninto being while Ron hopped on the spot, part of his shoe burned away by contact with \nthe hot metal. \n\n \u201cStand still, don\u2019t move!\u201d said Hermione, clutching at Ron. \n\n\f\n \u201cJust look around!\u201d said Harry. \u201cRemember, the cup\u2019s small and gold, it\u2019s got a \nbadger engraved on it, two handles \u2013 otherwise see if you can spot Ravenclaw\u2019s symbol \nanywhere, the eagle \u2013\u201d \n\n They directed their wands into every nook and crevice, turning cautiously on the \nspot. It was impossible not to brush up against anything; Harry sent a great cascade of \nfake Galleons onto the ground where they joined the goblets, and now there was scarcely \nroom to place their feet, and the glowing gold blazed with heat, so that the vault felt like a \nfurnace. Harry\u2019s wandlight passed over shields and goblin-made helmets set on shelves \nrising to the ceiling; higher and higher he raised the beam, until suddenly it found an \nobject that made his heart skip and his hand tremble. \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s there, it\u2019s up there!\u201d \n\n Ron and Hermione pointed there wands at it too, so that the little golden cup \nsparkled in a three-way spotlight: the cup that had belonged to Helga Hufflepuff, which \nhad passed into the possession of Hepzibah Smith, from whom it had been stolen by Tom \nRiddle. \n\n \u201cAnd how the hell are we going to get up there without touching anything?\u201d asked \nRon. \n\n \u201cAccio Cup!\u201d cried Hermione, who had evidently forgotten in her desperation \nwhat Griphook had told them during their planning sessions. \n\n \u201cNo use, no use!\u201d snarled the goblin. \n\n \u201cThen what do we do?\u201d said Harry, glaring at the goblin. \u201cIf you want the sword, \nGriphook, then you\u2019ll have to help us more than \u2013 wait! Can I touch stuff with the sword? \nHermione, give it here!\u201d \n\n Hermione fumbled insider her robes, drew out a beaded bag, rummaged for a few \nseconds, then removed the shining sword. Harry seized it by its rubied hilt and touched \nthe tip of the blade to a silver flagon nearby, which did not multiply. \n\n \u201cIf I can just poke the sword through a handle \u2013 but how am I going to get up \nthere?\u201d \n\n The shelf on which the cup reposed was out of reach for any of them, even Ron, \nwho was tallest. The heat from the enchanted treasure rose in waves, and sweat ran down \nHarry\u2019s face and back as he struggled to think of a way up to the cup; and then he heard \nthe dragon roar on the other side of the vault door, and the sound of clanking growing \nlouder and louder. \n\n They were truly trapped now: There was no way out except through the door, and \na horde of goblins seemed to be approaching on the other side. Harry looked at Ron and \nHermione and saw terror in their faces. \n\n \u201cHermione,\u201d said Harry, as the clanking grew louder, \u201cI\u2019ve got to get up there, \nwe\u2019ve got to get rid of it \u2013\u201d \n\n She raised her wand, pointed it at Harry, and whispered, \u201cLevicorpus.\u201d \n\n Hoisted into the air by his ankle, Harry hit a suit of armor and replicas burst out of \nit like white-hot bodies, filling the cramped space. With screams of pain, Ron, Hermione, \nand the two goblins were knocked aside into other objects, which also began to replicate. \nHalf buried in a rising tide of red-hot treasure, they struggled and yelled has Harry thrust \nthe sword through the handle of Hufflepuff\u2019s cup, hooking it onto the blade. \n\n \u201cImpervius!\u201d screeched Hermione in an attempt to protect herself, Ron, and the \ngoblins from the burning metal. \n\n\f\n Then the worst scream yet made Harry look down: Ron and Hermione were waist \ndeep in treasure, struggling to keep Bogrod from slipping beneath the rising tide, but \nGriphook had sunk out of sight; and nothing but the tips of a few long fingers were left in \nview. \n\n Harry seized Griphook\u2019s fingers and pulled. The blistered goblin emerged by \ndegrees, howling. \n\n \u201cLiberatocorpus!\u201d yelled Harry, and with a crash he and Griphook landed on the \nsurface of the swelling treasure, and the sword flew out of Harry\u2019s hand. \n\n \u201cGet it!\u201d Harry yelled, fighting the pain of the hot metal on his skin, as Griphook \nclambered onto his shoulders again, determined to avoid the swelling mass of red-hot \nobjects. \u201cWhere\u2019s the sword? It had the cup on it!\u201d \n\n The clanking on the other side of the door was growing deafening \u2013 it was too late \n\u2013 \n\n \u201cThere!\u201d \n\n It was Griphook who had seen it and Griphook who lunged, and in that instant \nHarry knew that the goblin had never expected them to keep their word. One hand \nholding tightly to a fistful of Harry\u2019s hair, to make sure he did not fall into the heaving \nsea of burning gold, Griphook seized the hilt of the sword and swung it high out of \nHarry\u2019s reach. The tiny golden cup, skewered by the handle on the sword\u2019s blade was \nflung into the air. The goblin astride him, Harry dived and caught it, and although he \ncould feel it scalding his flesh he did not relinquish it, even while countless Hufflepuff \ncups burst from his fist, raining down upon him as the entrance of the vault opened up \nagain and he found himself sliding uncontrollably on an expanding avalanche of fiery \ngold and silver that bore him, Ron, Hermione into the outer chamber. \n\n Hardly aware of the pain from the burns covering his body, and still borne along \nthe swell of replicating treasure, Harry shoved the cup into his pocket and reached up to \nretrieve the sword, but Griphook was gone. Sliding from Harry\u2019s shoulders the moment \nhe could, he had sprinted for cover amongst the surrounding goblins, brandishing the \nsword and crying, \u201cThieves! Thieves! Help! Thieves!\u201d He vanished into the midst of the \nadvancing crowd, all of whom were holding daggers and who accepted him without \nquestion. \n\n Slipping on the hot metal, Harry struggled to his feet and knew that the only way \nout was through. \n\n \u201cStupefy!\u201d he bellowed, and Ron and Hermione joined in: Jets of red light flew \ninto the crowd of goblins, and some toppled over, but others advanced, and Harry saw \nseveral wizard guards running around the corner. \n\n The tethered dragon let out a roar, and a gush of flame flew over the goblins; The \nwizards fled, doubled-up, back the way they had come, and inspiration, or madness, came \nto Harry. Pointing his wand at the thick cuffs chaining the beast to the floor, he yelled, \n\u201cRelashio!\u201d \n\n The cuffs broken open with loud bangs. \n\n \u201cThis way!\u201d Harry yelled, and still shooting Stunning Spells at the advancing \ngoblins, he sprinted toward the blind dragon. \n\n \u201cHarry \u2013 Harry \u2013 what are you doing?\u201d cried Hermione. \n\n \u201cGet up, climb up, come on \u2013\u201d \n\n\f\n The dragon had not realized that it was free: Harry\u2019s foot found the crook of its \nhind leg and he pulled himself up onto its back. The scales were hard as steel; it did not \neven seem to feel him. He stretched out an arm; Hermione hoisted herself up; Ron \nclimbed on behind them, and a second later the dragon became aware that it was \nuntethered. \n\n With a roar it reared: Harry dug in his knees, clutching as tightly as he could to \nthe jagged scales as the wings opened, knocking the shrieking goblins aside like skittles, \nand it soared into the air. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, flat on its back, scraped against the \nceiling as it dived toward the passage opening, while the pursuing goblins hurled daggers \nthat glanced off its flanks. \n\n \u201cWe\u2019ll never get out, it\u2019s too big!\u201d Hermione screamed, but the dragon opened its \nmouth and belched flame again, blasting the tunnel, whose floors and ceiling cracked and \ncrumbled. By sheer force, the dragon clawed and fought its way through. Harry\u2019s eyes \nwere shut tight against the heat and dust: Deafened by the crash of rock and the dragon\u2019s \nroars, he could only cling to its back, expecting to be shaken off at any moment; then he \nheard Hermione yelling, \u201cDefodio!\u201d \n\n She was helping the dragon enlarge the passageway, carving out the ceiling as it \nstruggled upward toward the fresher air, away from the shrieking and clanking goblins: \nHarry and Ron copied her, blasting the ceiling apart with more gouging spells. They \npassed the underground lake, and the great crawling, snarling beast seemed to sense \nfreedom and space ahead of it, and behind them the passage was full of the dragon\u2019s \nthrashing, spiked tail, of great lumps of rock, gigantic fractured stalactites, and the \nclanking of the goblins seemed to be growing more muffled, while ahead, the dragon\u2019s \nfire kept their progress clear \u2013 \n\n And then at last, by the combined force of their spells and the dragon\u2019s brute \nstrength, they had blasted their way out of the passage into the marble hallway. Goblins \nand wizards shrieked and ran for cover, and finally the dragon had room to stretch its \nwings: Turning its horned head toward the cool outside air it could smell beyond the \nentrance, it took off, and with Harry, Ron, and Hermione still clinging to its back, it \nforced its way through the metal doors, leaving them buckled and hanging from their \nhinges, as it staggered into Diagon Alley and launched itself into the sky. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter Twenty-Seven \n\nThe Final Hiding Place \n\n \n\nThere was no means of steering; the dragon could not see where it was \ngoing, and Harry knew that if it turned sharply or rolled in midair they \nwould find it impossible to cling onto its broad back. Nevertheless, as they \nclimbed higher and higher, London unfurling below them like a gray-and-green \nmap, Harry's overwhelming feeling was of gratitude for an escape that had \nseemed impossible. Crouching low over the beast's neck, he clung tight to \n\n\f\nthe metallic scales, and the cool breeze was soothing on his burned and \nblistered skin, the dragon's wings beating the air like the sails of a \nwindmill. Behind him, whether from delight or fear he could not tell. Ron \nkept swearing at the top of his voice, and Hermione seemed to be sobbing. \nAfter five minutes or so, Harry lost some of his immediate dread that \nthe dragon was going to throw them off, for it seemed intent on nothing but \ngetting as far away from its underground prison as possible; but the \nquestion of how and when they were to dismount remained rather frightening. \nHe had no idea how long dragons could fly without landing, nor how this \nparticular dragon, which could barely see, would locate a good place to put \ndown. He glanced around constantly, imagining that he could feel his seat \nprickling. \nHow long would it be before Voldemort knew that they had broken into the \nLestranges' vault? How soon would the goblins of Gringotts notify Bellatrix? \nHow quickly would they realize what had been taken? And then, when they \ndiscovered that the golden cup was missing? Voldemort would know, at last, \nthat they were hunting Horcruxes. \nThe dragon seemed to crave cooler and fresher air. It climbed steadily \nuntil they were flying through wisps of chilly cloud, and Harry could no \nlonger make out the little colored dots which were cars pouring in and out \nof the capital. On and on they flew, over countryside parceled out in \npatches of green and brown, over roads and rivers winding through the \nlandscape like strips of matte and glossy ribbon. \n\"What do you reckon it's looking for?\" Ron yelled as they flew farther \nand farther north. \n\"No idea,\" Harry bellow back. His hands were numb with cold but he did \nnot date attempt to shift his grip. He had been wondering for some time what \nthey would do if they saw the coast sail beneath them, if the dragon headed \nfor open seal he was cold and numb, not to mention desperately hungry and \nthirsty. When, he wondered, had the beast itself last eaten? Surely it would \nneed sustenance before long? And what if, at that point, it realized it had \nthree highly edible humans sitting on its back? \nThe sun slipped lower in the sky, which was turning indigo; and still \nthe dragon flew, cities and towns gliding out of sight beneath them, its \nenormous shadow sliding over the earth like a giant dark cloud. Every part \nof Harry ached with the effort of holding on to the dragon's back. \n\"Is it my imagination,\" shouted Ron after a considerable stretch of \nsilence, \"or are we losing height?\" \nHarry looked down and saw deep green mountains and lakes, coppery in the \nsunset. the landscape seemed to grow larger and more detailed as he squinted \nover the side of the dragon, and he wondered whether it had divined the \npresence of fresh water by the flashes of reflected sunlight. \nLower and lower the dragon flew, in great spiraling circles, honing in, \nit seemed, upon one of the smaller lakes. \n\"I say we jump when it gets low enough!\" Harry called back to the \nothers. \"Straight into the water before it realizes we're here!\" \n\n\f\n They agreed, Hermione a little faintly, and now Harry could see the \ndragon's wide yellow underbelly rippling in the surface of the water. \n\"NOW!\" \nHe slithered over the side of the dragon and plummeted feetfirst toward \nthe surface of the lake; the drop was greater than he had estimated and he \nhit the water hard, plunging like a stone into a freezing, green, \nreed-filled world. He kicked toward the surface and emerged, panting, to see \nenormous ripples emanating in circles from the places where Ron and Hermione \nhad fallen. The dragon did not seem to have noticed anything; it was already \nfifty feet away, swooping low over the lake to scoop up water in its scarred \nsnout. As Ron and Hermione emerged, spluttering and gasping, from the depths \nof the lake, the dragon flew on, its wings beating hard, and landed at last \non a distant bank. \nHarry, Ron and Hermione struck out for the opposite shore. The lake did \nnot seem to be deep. Soon it was more a question of fighting their way \nthrough reeds and mud than swimming, and at last they flopped, sodden, \npanting, and exhausted, onto slippery grass. \nHermione collapsed, coughing and shuddering. Though Harry could have \nhappily lain down and slept, he staggered to his feet, drew out his wand, \nand started casting the usual protective spells around them. \nWhen he had finished, he joined the others. It was the first time that \nhe had seen them properly since escaping from the vault. Both had angry red \nburns all over their faces and arms, and their clothing was singed away in \nplaces. They were wincing as they dabbed essence of dittany onto their many \ninjuries. Hermione handed Harry the bottle, then pulled out three bottles of \npumpkin juice she had brought from Shell Cottage and clean, dry robes for \nall of them. They changes and then gulped down the juice. \n\"Well, on the upside,\" said Ron finally, who was sitting watching the \nskin on his hands regrow, \"we got the Horcrux. On the downside-\" \n\"-- no sword,\" said Harry through gritted teeth, as he dripped dittany \nthrough the singed hole in his jeans onto the angry burn beneath. \n\"No sword,\" repeated Ron. \"That double-crossing little scab...\" \nHarry pulled the Horcrux from the pocket of the wet jacket he had just \ntaken off and set it down on the grass in front of them. Glinting in the \nsun, it drew their eyes as they swigged their bottles of juice. \n\"At least we can't wear it this time, that'd look a bit weird hanging \naround our necks,\" said Ron, wiping his mouth on the back of his hand. \nHermione looked across the lake to the far bank where the dragon was \nstill drinking. \n\"What'll happen to it, do you think?\" she asked, \"Will it be alright?\" \n\"You sound like Hagrid,\" said Ron, \"It's a dragon, Hermione, it can look \nafter itself. It's us we need to worry about.\" \n\"What do you mean?\" \n\"Well I don't know how to break this to you,\" said Ron, \"but I think \nthey might have noticed we broke into Gringotts.\" \nAll three of them started to laugh, and once started, it was difficult \n\n\f\nto stop. Harry's ribs ached, he felt lightheaded with hunger, but he lay \nback on the grass beneath the reddening sky and laughed until his throat was \nraw. \n\"What are we going to do, though?\" said Hermione finally, hiccuping \nherself back to seriousness. \"He'll know, won't he? You-Know-Who will know \nwe know about his Horcruxes!\" \n\"Maybe they'll be too scared to tell him!\" said Ron hopefully, \"Maybe \nthey'll cover up --\" \nThe sky, the smell of the lake water, the sound of Ron's voice were \nextinguished. Pain cleaved Harry's head like a sword stroke. He was standing \nin a dimly lit room, and a semicircle of wizards faced him, and on the floor \nat his feet knelt a small, quaking figure. \n\"What did you say to me?\" His voice was high and cold, but fury and fear \nburned inside him. The one thing that he had dreaded - but it could not be \ntrue, he could not see how... \nThe goblin was trembling, unable to meet the red eyes high above his. \n\"Say it again!\" murmured Voldemort. \"Say it again!\" \n\"M-my Lord,\" stammered the goblin, its black eyes wide with terror, \n\"m-my Lord... we t-tried to st-stop them... Im-impostors, my Lord... broke - \nbroke into the - into the Lestranges' vault...\" \n\"Impostors? What impostors? I thought Gringotts had ways of revealing \nimpostors? Who were they? \n\"It was... it was... the P-Potter b-boy and the t-two accomplices...\" \n\"And they took?\" he said, his voice rising, a terrible fear gripping \nhim, \"Tell me! What did they take?\" \n\"A... a s-small golden c-cup m-my Lord...\" \nThe scream of rage, of denial left him as if it were a stranger's. He \nwas crazed, frenzied, it could not be true, it was impossible, nobody had \nknown. How was it possible that the boy could have discovered his secret? \nThe Elder Wand slashed through the air and green light erupted through \nthe room; the kneeling goblin rolled over dead; the watching wizards \nscattered before him, terrified. Bellatrix and Lucius Malfoy threw others \nbehind them in their race for the door, and again and again his wand fell, \nand those who were left were slain, all of them, for bringing him this news, \nfor hearing about the golden cup - \nAlone amongst the dead he stomped up and down, and they passed before him \nin vision: his treasures, his safeguards, his anchors to immortality - the \ndiary was destroyed and the cup was stolen. What if, what if, the boy knew \nabout the others? Could he know, had he already acted, had he traced more of \nthem? Was Dumbledore at the root of this? Dumbledore, who had always \nsuspected him; Dumbledore, dead on his orders; Dumbledore, whose wand was \nhis now, yet who reached out from the ignominy of death through the boy, the \nboy - \nBut surely if the boy had destroyed any of his Horcruxes, he, Lord \nVoldemort, would have known, would have felt it? He, the greatest wizard of \nthem all; he, the most powerful; he, the killer of Dumbledore and of how \n\n\f\nmany other worthless, nameless men. How could Lord Voldemort not have known, \nif he, himself, most important and precious, had been attacked, mutilated? \nTrue, he had not felt it when the diary had been destroyed, but he had \nthought that was because he had no body to fell, being less than ghost... \nNo, surely, the rest were safe... The other Horcruxes must be intact... \nBut he must know, he must be sure... He paced the room, kicking aside \nthe goblin's corpse as he passed, and the pictures blurred and burned in his \nboiling brain: the lake, the shack, and Hogwarts - \nA modicum of calm cooled his rage now. How could the boy know that he \nhad hidden the ring in the Gaunt shack? No one had ever known him to be \nrelated to the Gaunts, he had hidden the connection, the killings had never \nbeen traced to him. The ring, surely, was safe. \nAnd how could the boy, or anybody else, know about the cave or penetrate \nits protection? The idea of the locket being stolen was absurd... \nAs for the school: He alone knew where in Hogwarts he had stowed the \nHorcrux, because he alone had plumed the deepest secrets of that place... \nAnd there was still Nagini, who must remain close now, no longer sent to \ndo his bidding, under his protection... \nBut to be sure, to be utterly sure, he must return to each of his hiding \nplaces, he must redouble protection around each of his Horcruxes... A job, \nlike the quest for the Elder Wand, that he must undertake alone... \nWhich should he visit first, which was in most danger? An old unease \nflickered inside him. Dumbledore had known his middle name... Dumbledore \nmight have made the connection with the Gaunts... Their abandoned home was, \nperhaps, the least secure of his hiding places, it was there that he would \ngo first... \nThe lake, surely impossible... though was there a slight possibility \nthat Dumbledore might have known some of his past misdeeds, through the \norphanage. \nAnd Hogwarts... but he knew the his Horcrux there was safe; it would be \nimpossible for Potter to enter Hogsmeade without detection, let alone the \nschool. Nevertheless, it would be prudent to alert Snape to the fact that \nthe boy might try to reenter the castle. ... To tell Snape why the boy might \nreturn would be foolish, of course; it had been a grave mistake to trust \nBellatrix and Malfoy. Didn't their stupidity and carelessness prove how \nunwise it was ever to trust? \nHe would visit the Gaunt shack first, then, and take Nagini with him. He \nwould not be parted from the snake anymore ... and he strode from the room, \nthrough the hall, and out into the dark garden where the fountain played; he \ncalled the snake in Parseltongue and it slithered out to join him like a \nlong shadow. ... \nHarry's eyes flew open as he wrenched himself back to the present. He \nwas lying on the bank of the lake in the setting sun, and Ron and Hermione \nwere looking down at him. Judging by their worried looks, and by the \ncontinued pounding of his scar, his sudden excursion into Voldemort's mind \nhad not passed unnoticed. He struggled up, shivering, vaguely surprised that \n\n\f\nhe was still wet to his skin, and saw the cup lying innocently in the grass \nbefore him, and the lake, deep blue shot with gold in the falling sun. \n\"He knows.\" His own voice sounded strange and low after Voldemort's high \nscreams. \"He knows and he's going to check where the others are, and the \nlast one,\" he was already on his feet,\" is at Hogwarts. I knew it. I knew \nit.\" \n\"What?\" \nRon was gaping at him; Hermione sat up, looking worried. \n\"But what did you see? How do you know?\" \n\"I saw him find out about the cup, I - I was in his head, he's\" - Harry \nremembered the killings - \"he's seriously angry, and scared too, he can't \nunderstand how we knew, and now he's going to check the others are safe, the \nring first. He things the Hogwarts one is safest, because Snape's there, \nbecause it'll be so hard not to be seen getting in. I think he'll check that \none last, but he could still be there within hours -\" \n\"Did you see where in Hogwarts it is?\" asked Ron, now scrambling to his \nfeet too. \n\"No, he was concentrating on warning Snape, he didn't think about \nexactly where it is -\" \n\"Wait, wait!\" cried Hermione as Ron caught up to the Horcrux and Harry \npulled out the Invisibility Cloak again. \"We can't just go, we haven't got a \nplan, we need to -\" \n\"We need to get going,\" said Harry firmly. He had been hoping to sleep, \nlooking forward to getting into the new tent, but that was impossible now, \n\"Can you imagine what he's going to do once he realizes the ring and the \nlocket are gone? What if he moves the Hogwarts Horcrux, decides it isn't \nsafe enough? \n\"But how are we going to get in?\" \n\"We'll go to Hogsmeade,\" said Harry, \"and try to work something out once \nwe see what the protection around the school's like. Get under the Cloak, \nHermione, I want to stick together this time.\" \n\"But we don't really fit -\" \n\"It'll be dark, no one's going to notice our feet.\" \nThe flapping of enormous wings echoed across the black water. The dragon \nhad drunk its fill and risen into the air. They paused in their preparations \nto watch it climb higher and higher, now black against the rapidly darkening \nsky, until it vanished over a nearby mountain. Then Hermione walked forward \nand took her place between the other two, Harry pulled the Cloak down as far \nas it would go, and together they turned on the spot into the crushing \ndarkness. \n\nChapter Twenty-Eight \n\nThe Missing Mirror \n\n \n\n\f\n Harry's feet touched the road. He saw the achingly familiar Hogsmeade High Street: \ndark shop \n\nfronts, and the mist line of black mountains beyond the village and the curve in the road \nahead that \n\nled off toward Hogwarts, and light spilling from the windows of the Three Broomsticks, \nand with a \n\nlurch of the hear, he remembered with piercing accuracy, how he had landed here nearly \na year before, \n\nsupporting a desperately weak Dumbledore, all this in a second, upon landing -- and then, \neven as he \n\nrelaxed his grip upon Ron's and Hermione's arms, it happened. \n\n The air was rent by a scream that sounded like Voldemort's when he had realized \nthe cup had \n\nbeen stolen: It tore at every nerve in Harry's body, and he knew that their appearance had \ncaused it. \n\nEven as he looked at the other two beneath the Cloak, the door of the Three Broomsticks \nburst open \n\nand a dozen cloaked and hooded Death Eaters dashed into the streets, their wands aloft. \n\n Harry seized Ron's wrist as he raised his wand; there were too many of them to \nrun. Even \n\nattempting it would have give away their position. One of the Death Eaters raised his \nwand, and the \n\nscream stopped, still echoing around the distant mountains. \n\n \"Accio Cloak!\" roared one of the Death Eaters \n\n Harry seized his folds, but it made no attempt to escape. The Summoning Charm \nhad not \n\nworked on it. \n\n \"Not under your wrapper, then, Potter?\" yelled the Death Eater who had tried the \ncharm and \n\nthen to his fellows. \"Spread now. He's here.\" \n\n Six of the Death Eaters ran toward them: Harry, Ron and Hermione backed as \nquickly as \n\npossible down the nearest side street, and the Death Eaters missed them by inches. They \nwaited \n\nin the darkness, listening to the footsteps running up and down, beams of light flying \nalong the street \n\nfrom the Death Eaters' searching wands. \n\n \"Let's just leave!\" Hermione whispered. \"Disapparate now!\" \n\n \"Great idea,\" said Ron, but before Harry could reply, a Death Eater shouted, \n\n \"We know you are here, Potter, and there's no getting away! We'll find you!\" \n\n \"They were ready for us,\" whispered Harry. \"They set up that spell to tell them \nwe'd come. \n\nI reckon they\u2019ve done something to keep us here, trap us - \" \n\n \"What about dementors?\" called another Death Eater. \"Let'em have free rein, \nthey'd find him \n\nquick enough!\" \n\n\f\n \"The Dark Lord wants Potter dead by no hands but his - \" \n\n \" 'an dementors won't kill him! The Dark Lord wants Potter's life, nor his soul. \nHe'll be easier to \n\nkill if he's been Kissed first!\" \n\n There were noises of agreement. Dread filled Harry: To repel dementors they \nwould have to produce \n\nPatronuses which would give them away immediately. \n\n \"We're going to have to try to Disapparate, Harry!\" Hermione whispered. \n\n Even as she said it, he felt the unnatural cold being spread over the street. Light \nwas sucked from \n\nthe environment right up to the stars, which vanished. In the pitch blackness, he felt \nHermione take hold \n\nof his arm and together, they turned on the spot. \n\n The air through which they needed to move, seemed to have become solid: They \ncould not \n\nDisapparate; the Death Eaters had cast their charms well. The cold was biting deeper and \ndeeper \n\ninto Harry's flesh. He, Ron and Hermione retreated down the side street, groping their \nway along the wall \n\ntrying not to make a sound. Then, around the corner, gliding noiselessly, came dementors, \nten or more \n\nof them, visible because they were of a denser darkness than their surroundings, with \ntheir black cloaks \n\nand their scabbed and rotting hands. Could they sense fear in the vicinity? Harry was sure \nof it: They \n\nseemed to be coming more quickly now, taking those dragging, rattling breaths he \ndetested, tasting \n\ndespair in the air, closing in - \n\n He raised his wand: He could not, would not suffer the Dementor's Kiss, whatever \nhappened afterward. \n\nIt was of Ron and Hermione that he thought as he whispered \"Expecto Patronum!\" \n\n The silver stag burst from his wand and charged: The Dementors scattered and \nthere was a triumphant \n\nyell from somewhere out of sight \n\n \"It's him, down there, down there, I saw his Patronus, it was a stag!\" \n\n The Dementors have retreated, the stars were popping out again and the footsteps \nof the Death Eaters \n\nwere becoming louder; but before Harry in his panic could decide what to do, there was a \ngrinding of bolts \n\nnearby, a door opened on the left-side of the narrow street, and a rough voice said: \n\"Potter, in here, quick!\" \n\n He obeyed without hesitation, the three of them hurried through the open doorway. \n\n \"Upstairs, keep the Cloak on, keep quiet!\" muttered a tall figure, passing them on \nhis way into the street \n\nand slammed the door behind him. \n\n\f\n Harry had had no idea where they were, but now he saw, by the stuttering light of \na single candle, \n\nthe grubby, sawdust bar of the Hog's Head Inn. They ran behind the counter and through \na second doorway, \n\nwhich led to a trickery wooden staircase, that they climbed as fast as they could. The \nstairs opened into \n\na sitting room with a durable carpet and a small fireplace, above which hung a single \nlarge oil painting of a blonde \n\ngirl who gazed out at the room with a kind of a vacant sweetness. \n\n Shouts reached from the streets below. Still wearing the Invisibility Cloak on, \nthey hurried toward the \n\ngrimy window and looked down. Their savior, whom Harry now recognized as the Hog's \nHead's barman, was \n\nthe only person not wearing a hood. \n\n \"So what?\" he was bellowing into one of the hooded faces. \"So what? You send \ndementors down my street, \n\nI'll send a Patronus back at'em! I'm not having'em near me, I've told you that. I'm not \nhaving it!\" \n\n \"That wasn't your Patronus,\" said a Death Eater. \"That was a stag. It was \nPotter's!\" \n\n \"Stag!\" roared the barman, and he pulled out a wand. \"Stag! You idiot - Expecto \nPatronum!\" \n\n Something huge and horned erupted from the wand. Head down, it charged \ntoward the High Street, and \n\nout of sight. \n\n \"That's not what I saw\" said the Death Eater, though was less certainly \n\n \"Curfew's been broken, you heard the noise,\" one of his companions told the \nbarman. \"Someone was \n\nout on the streets against regulations - \" \n\n \"If I want to put my cat out, I will, and be damned to your curfew!\" \n\n \"You set off the Caterwauling Charm?\" \n\n \"What if I did? Going to cart me off to Azkaban? Kill me for sticking my nose out \nmy own front door? Do it, \n\nthen, if you want to! But I hope for your sakes you haven't pressed your little Dark Marks, \nand summoned him. He's \n\nnot going to like being called here, for me and my old cat, is he, now?\" \n\n \"Don't worry about us.\" said one of the Death Eaters, \"worry about yourself, \nbreaking curfew!\" \n\n \"And where will you lot traffic potions and poisons when my pub's closed down? \nWhat will happen to your \n\nlittle sidelines then?\" \n\n \"Are you threatening - ?\" \n\n \"I keep my mouth shut, it's why you come here, isn't it?\" \n\n \"I still say I saw a stag Patronus!\" shouted the first Death Eater. \n\n \"Stag?\" roared the barman. \"It's a goat, idiot!\" \n\n\f\n \"He's dead,\" said Harry, \"Bellatrix Lestrange killed him.\" \n\n The barman face was impassive. After a few moments he said, \"I'm sorry to hear \nit, I liked that elf.\" \n\n He turned away, lightning lamps with prods of his wand, not looking at any of \nthem. \n\n \"You're Aberforth,\" said Harry to the man's back. \n\n He neither confirmed or denied it, but bent to light the fire. \n\n \"How did you get this?\" Harry asked, walking across to Sirius's mirror, the twin \nof the one he had broken \n\nnearly two years before. \n\n \"Bought it from Dung 'bout a year ago,\" said Aberforth. \"Albus told me what it \nwas. Been trying to keep \n\nan eye out for you.\" \n\n Ron gasped. \n\n \"The silver doe,\" he said excitedly, \"Was that you too?\" \n\n \"What are you talking about?\" asked Aberforth. \n\n \"Someone sent a doe Patronus to us!\" \n\n \"Brains like that, you could be a Death Eater, son. Haven't I just prove my \nPatronus is a goat?\" \n\n \"Oh,\" said Ron, \"Yeah... well, I'm hungry!\" he added defensively as his stomach \ngave an enormous \n\nrumble. \n\n \"I got food,\" said Aberforth, and he sloped out of the room, reappearing moments \nlater with a large \n\n \"All right, we made a mistake,\" said the second Death Eater. \"Break curfew again \nand we won't be so lenient!\" \n\n The Death Eaters strode back towards the High Street. Hermione moaned with \nrelief, wove out from under the Cloak, \n\nand sat down on a wobble-legged chair. Harry drew the curtains then pulled the Cloak off \nhimself and Ron. They could hear the \n\nbarman down below, rebolting the door of the bar, then climbing the stairs. \n\n Harry's attention was caught by something on the mantelpiece: a small, \nrectangular mirror, propped on top of it, \n\nright beneath the portrait of the girl. \n\n The barman entered the room. \n\n \"You bloody fools,\" he said gruffly, looking from one to the other of them. \"What \nwere you thinking, coming here?\" \n\n \"Thank you,\" said Harry. \"You can't thank you enough. You saved our lives!\" \n\n The barman grunted. Harry approached him looking up into the face: trying to see \npast the long, stringy, wire-gray hair \n\nbeard. He wore spectacles. Behind the dirty lenses, the eyes were a piercing, brilliant blue. \n\n \"It's your eye I've been seeing in the mirror.\" \n\n There was a silence in the room. Harry and the barman looked at each other. \n\n \"You sent Dobby.\" \n\n The barman nodded and looked around for the elf. \n\n \"Thought he'd be with you. Where've you left him? \n\n\f\nloaf of bread, some cheese, and a pewter jug of mead, which he set upon a small table in \nfront of the fire. \n\nRavenous, they ate and drank, and for a while there was sound of chewing. \n\n \"Right then,\" said Aberforth when the had eaten their fill and Harry and Ron sat \nslumped dozily in \n\ntheir chairs. \"We need to think of the best way to get you out of here. Can't be done by \nnight, you heard what \n\nhappens if anyone moves outdoors during darkness: Caterwauling Charm's set off, they'll \nbe onto you like \n\nbowtruckles on doxy eggs. I don't reckon I'll be able to pass of a stag as a goat a second \ntime. Wait for daybreak \n\nwhen curfew lifts, then you can put your Cloak back on and set out on foot. Get right out \nof Hogsmeade, up into \n\nthe mountains, and you'll be able to Disapparate there. Might see Hagrid. He's been \nhiding in a cave up there with \n\nGrawp ever since they tried to arrest him.\" \n\n \"We're not leaving,\" said Harry. \"We need to get into Hogwarts.\" \n\n \"Don't be stupid, boy,\" said Aberforth. \n\n \"We've got to,\" said Harry. \n\n \"What you've got to do,\" said Aberforth, leaning forward, \"is to get as far from \nhere as from here as you \n\ncan.\" \n\n \"You don't understand. There isn't much time. We've got to get into the castle. \nDumbledore - I mean, \n\nyour brother - wanted us - \" \n\n The firelight made the grimy lenses of Aberforth's glasses momentarily opaque, a \nbright flat white, and \n\nHarry remembered the blind eyes of the giant spider, Aragog. \n\n \"My brother Albus wanted a lot of things,\" said Aberforth, \"and people had a \nhabit of getting hurt while he \n\nwas carrying out his grand plans. You get away from this school, Potter, and out of the \ncountry if you can. Forget \n\nmy brother and his clever schemes. He's gone where none of this can hurt him, and you \ndon't owe him anything.\" \n\n \"You don't understand.\" said Harry again. \n\n \"Oh, don't I? said Aberforth quietly. \"You don't think I understood my own \nbrother? Think you know Albus \n\nbetter than I did?\" \n\n \"I didn't mean that,\" said Harry, whose brain felt sluggish with exhaustion and \nfrom the surfeit of food and wine. \n\n\"It's... he left me a job.\" \n\n \"Did he now?\" said Aberforth. \"Nice job, I hope? Pleasant? Easy? Sort of thing \nyou'd expect an unqualified \n\nwizard kid to be able to do without overstretching themselves?\" \n\n Ron gave a rather grim laugh. Hermione was looking strained. \n\n \"I-it's not easy, no,\" said Harry. \"But I've got to - \" \n\n\f\n \"Got to? Why got to? He's dead, isn't he?\" said Aberforth roughly. \"Let it go, boy, \nbefore you follow him! \n\nSave yourself!\" \n\n \"I can't.\" \n\n \"Why not?\" \n\n \"I - \" Harry felt overwhelmed; he could not explain, so he took the offensive \ninstead. \"But you're fighting too, \n\nyou're in the Order of the Phoenix - \" \n\n \"I was,\" said Aberforth. \"The Order of the Phoenix is finished. You-Know-Who's \nwon, it's over, and anyone \n\nwho's pretending different's kidding themselves. It'll never be safe for you here, Potter, he \nwants you too badly. \n\nSo go abroad, go into hiding, save yourself. Best take these two with you.\" He jerked a \nthumb at Ron and Hermione. \n\n\"They'll be in danger long as they live now everyone knows they've been working with \nyou.\" \n\n \"I can't leave,\" said Harry. \"I've got a job - \" \n\n \"Give it to someone else!\" \n\n \"I can't. It's got to be me, Dumbledore explained it all - \" \n\n \"Oh, did he now? And did he tell you everything, was he honest with you?\" \n\n Harry wanted him with all his heart to say \"Yes,\" but somehow the simple word \nwould not rise to his lips, \n\nAberforth seemed to know what he was thinking. \n\n \"I knew my brother, Potter. He learned secrecy at our mother's knee. Secrets and \nlies, that's how we grew \n\nup, and Albus... he was a natural.\" \n\n The old man's eyes traveled to the painting of the girl over the mantelpiece. It was, \nnow Harry looked around \n\nproperly, the only picture in the room. There was no photograph of Albus Dumbledore, \nnor of anyone else. \n\n \"Mr. Dumbledore\" said Hermione rather timidly. \"Is that your sister? Ariana? \n\n \"Yes.\" said Aberforth tersely. \"Been reading Rita Skeeter, have you, missy?\" \n\n Even by the rosy light of the fire it was clear that Hermione had turned red. \n\n \"Elphias Doge mentioned her to us,\" said Harry, trying to spare Hermione. \n\n \"That old berk,\" muttered Aberforth, taking another swig of mead. \"Thought the \nsun shone out of my \n\nbrother's every office, he did. Well, so did plenty of people, you three included, by the \nlooks of it.\" \n\n Harry kept quiet. He did not want to express the doubts and uncertainties about \nDumbledore that had \n\nriddled him for months now. He had made his choice while he dug Dobby's grave, he had \ndecided to continue \n\nalong the winding, dangerous path indicated for him by Albus Dumbledore, to accept that \nhe had not been told \n\neverything that he wanted to know, but simply to trust. He had no desire to doubt again; \nhe did not want o hear \n\n\f\nanything that would deflect him from his purpose. He met Aberforth's gaze, which was so \nstrikingly like his \n\nbrothers': The bright blue eyes gave the same impression that they were X-raying the \nobject of their scrutiny, \n\nand Harry thought that Aberforth knew what he was thinking and despised him for it. \n\n \"Professor Dumbledore cared about Harry, very much,\" said Hermione in a low \nvoice. \n\n \"Did he now?\" said Aberforth. \"Funny thing how many of the people my brother \ncared about very much \n\nended up in a worse state than if he'd left 'em well alone.\" \n\n \"What do you mean?\" asked Hermione breathlessly. \n\n \"Never you mind,\" said Aberforth. \n\n \"But that's a really serious thing to say!\" said Hermione. \"Are you - are you \ntalking about your sister?\" \n\n Aberforth glared at her: His lips moved as if he were chewing the words he was \nholding back. Then he burst \n\ninto speech. \n\n \"When my sister was six years old, she was attacked, by three Muggle boys. \nThey'd seen her doing magic, \n\nspying through the back garden hedge: She was a kid, she couldn't control it, no witch or \nwizard can at that age. \n\nWhat they saw, scared them, I expect. They forced their way through the hedge, and \nwhen she couldn't show them \n\nthe trick, they got a bit carried away trying to stop the little freak doing it.\" \n\n Hermione's eyes were huge in the firelight; Ron looked slightly sick. Aberforth \nstood up, tall as Albus, and \n\nsuddenly terrible in his anger and the intensity of his pain. \n\n \"It destroyed her, what they did: She was never right again. She wouldn't use \nmagic, but she couldn't get rid \n\nof it; it turned inward and drove her mad, it exploded out of her when she couldn't control \nit, and at times she was \n\nstrange and dangerous. But mostly she was sweet and scared and harmless. \n\n \"And my father went after the bastards that did it,\" said Aberforth, \"and attacked \nthem. And they locked him \n\nup in Azkaban for it. He never said why he'd done it, because the Ministry had known \nwhat Ariana had become, \n\nshe'd have been locked up in St. Mungo's for good. They'd have seen her as a serious \nthreat to the International \n\nStatute of Secrecy, unbalanced like she was, with magic exploding out of her at moments \nwhen she couldn't keep it \n\nin any longer. \n\n \"We had to keep her safe and quiet. We moved house, put it about she was ill, and \nmy mother looked after \n\nher, and tried to keep her calm and happy. \n\n \"I was her favourite,\" he said, and as he said it, a grubby schoolboy seemed to \nlook out through Aberforth's \n\n\f\nwrinkles and wrangled beard. \"Not Albus, he was always up in his bedroom when he was \nhome, reading his books \n\nand counting his prizes, keeping up with his correspondence with \"the most notable \nmagical names of the day,\" \n\nAberforth succored. \"He didn't want to be bothered with her. She liked me best. I could \nget her to eat when she wouldn't \n\ndo it for my mother, I could calm her down, when she was in one of her rages, and when \nshe was quiet, she used to \n\nhelp me feed the goats. \n\n \"Then, when she was fourteen... See, I wasn't there.\" said Aberforth. \"If I'd been \nthere, I could have calmed \n\nher down. She had one of her rages, and my mother wasn't as young as she was, and . . . it \nwas an accident. Ariana \n\ncouldn't control it. But my mother was killed.\" \n\n Harry felt a horrible mixture of pity and repulsion; he did not want to hear any \nmore, but Aberforth kept talking, \n\nand Harry wondered how long it had been since he had spoken about this; whether, in \nfact, he had ever spoken about it. \n\n \"So that put paid to Albus's trip round the world with little Doge. The pair of 'em \ncame home for my mother's \n\nfuneral and then Doge went off on his own, and Albus settled down as head of the family. \nHa!\" \n\n Aberforth spat into the fire. \n\n \"I'd have looked after her, I told him so, I didn't care about school, I'd have stayed \nhome and done it. \n\nHe told me I had to finish my education and he'd take over from my mother. Bit of a \ncomedown for Mr. Brilliant, \n\nthere's no prizes for looking after your half-mad sister, stopping her blowing up the house \nevery other day. But he \n\ndid all right for a few weeks . . . till he came.\" \n\n And now a positively dangerous look crept over Aberforth\u2019s face. \n\n \"Grindelwald. And at last, my brother had an equal to talk to someone just as \nbright and talented he was. And \n\nlooking after Ariana took a backseat then, while they were hatching all their plans for a \nnew Wizarding order and looking \n\nfor Hallows, and whatever else it was they were so interested in. Grand plans for the \nbenefit of all Wizardkind, and if one \n\nyoung girl neglected, what did that matter, when Albus was working for the greater \ngood? \n\n \"But after a few weeks of it, I'd had enough, I had. It was nearly time for me to go \nhack to Hogwarts, so I told 'em, \n\nboth of 'em, face-to-face, like I am to you, now,\" and Aberforth looked downward Harry, \nand it took a little imagination to \n\nsee him as a teenager, wiry and angry, confronting his elder brother. \"I told him, you'd \nbetter give it up now. You can't move her, \n\n\f\nshe's in no fit state, you can't take her with you, wherever it is you're planning to go, \nwhen you're making your clever speeches, \n\ntrying to whip yourselves up a following. He didn't like that.\" said Aberforth, and his \neyes were briefly occluded by the fireflight on \n\nthe lenses of his glasses: They turned white and blind again. \"Grindelwald didn't like that \nat all. He got angry. He told me what a \n\nstupid little boy I was, trying to stand in the way of him and my brilliant brother . . . \nDidn't I understand, my poor sister wouldn't \n\nhave to be hidden once they'd changed the world, and led the wizards out of hiding, and \ntaught the Muggles their place? \n\n \"And there was an argument . . . and I pulled my wand, and he pulled out his, and \nI had the Cruciatus Curse used on \n\nme by my brother's best friend - and Albus was trying to stop him, and then all three of us \nwere dueling, and the flashing lights \n\nand the bangs set her off, she couldn't stand it - \" \n\n The color was draining from Aberforth's face as though he had suffered a mortal \nwound. \n\n \" - and I think she wanted to help, but she didn't really know what she was doing, \nand I don't know which of us did it, \n\nit could have been any of us - and she was dead.\" \n\n His voice broke on the last word and he dropped down into the nearest chair. \nHermione's face was wet with tears, and Ron \n\nwas almost as pale as Aberforth. Harry felt nothing but revulsion: He wished he had not \nheard it, wished he could wash is mind clean of it. \n\n \"I'm so . . . I'm so sorry,\" Hermione whispered. \n\n \"Gone,\" croaked Aberforth. \"Gone forever.\" \n\n He wiped his nose on hiss cuff and cleared his throat. \n\n \" 'Course, Grindelwald scarpered. He had a bit of a track record already, back in \nhis own country, and he didn't want Ariana \n\nset to his account too. And Albus was free, wasn't he? Free of the burden of his sister, \nfree to become the greatest wizard of the - \" \n\n \"He was never free,\" said Harry. \n\n \"I beg your pardon?\" said Aberforth. \n\n \"Never,\" said Harry. \"The night that your brother died, he drank a potion that \ndrove him out of his mind. He started screaming, \n\npleading with someone who wasn't there. 'Don't hurt them, please . . . hurt me instead.' \" \n\n Ron and Hermione were staring at Harry. He had never gone into details about \nwhat had happened on the island on the lake: \n\nThe events that had taken place after he and Dumbledore had returned to Hogwarts had \neclipsed it so thoroughly. \n\n \"He thought he was back there with you and Grindelwald, I know he did,\" said \nHarry, remembering Dumbledore whispering, pleading. \n\n\"He thought he was watching Grindelwald hurting you and Ariana . . . It was torture to \nhim, if you'd seen him then, you wouldn't say he was free.\" \n\n Aberforth seemed lost in contemplation of his own knotted and veined hands. \nAfter a long pause he said. \"How can you be sure, Potter, \n\n\f\nthat my brother wasn't more interested in the greater good than in you? How can you be \nsure you aren't dispensable, just like my little sister?\" \n\n A shard of ice seemed to pierce Harry's heart. \n\n \"I don't believe it. Dumbledore loved Harry,\" said Hermione. \n\n \"Why didn't he tell him to hide, then? shot back Aberforth. \"Why didn't he say to \nhim, 'Take care of yourself, here's how to survive' ?\" \n\n \"Because,\" said Harry before Hermione could answer, \"sometimes you've got to \nthink about more than your own safety! Sometimes \n\nyou've got to think about the greater good! This is war!\" \n\n \"You're seventeen, boy!\" \n\n \"I'm of age, and I'm going to keep fighting even if you've given up!\" \n\n \"Who says I've given up?\" \n\n \"The Order of the Phoenix is finished,\" Harry repeated, \"You-Know-Who's won, \nit's over, and anyone who's pretending different's kidding \n\nthemselves.\" \n\n \"I don't say I like it, but it's the truth!\" \n\n \"No, it isn't.\" said Harry. \"Your brother knew how to finish You-Know-Who and \nhe passed the knowledge on to me. I'm going to keep going \n\nuntil I succeed - or I die. Don't think I don't know how this might end. I've known it for \nyears.\" \n\n He waited for Aberforth to jeer or to argue, but he did not. He merely moved. \n\n \"We need to get into Hogwarts,\" said Harry again. \"If you can't help us, we'll wait \ntill daybreak, leave you in peace, and try to find a way \n\nin ourselves. If you can help us - well, now would be a great time to mention it.\" \n\n Aberforth remained fixed in his chair, gazing at Harry with the eye, that were so \nextraordinarily like his brother's. At last he cleared his \n\nthroat, got to his feet, walked around the little table, and approached the portrait of Ariana. \n\n \"You know what to do,\" he said. \n\n She smiled, turned, and walked away, not as people in portraits usually did, one of \nthe sides of their frames, but along what seemed to \n\nbe a long tunnel painted behind her. They watched her slight figure retreating until finally \nshe was swallowed by the darkness. \n\n \"Er - what - ?\" began Ron. \n\n \"There's only one way in now,\" said Aberforth. \"You must know they've got all \nthe old secret passageways covered at both ends, dementors \n\nall around the boundary walls, regular patrols inside the school from what my sources tell \nme. The place has never been so heavily guarded. \n\nHow you expect to do anything once you get inside it, with Snape in charge and the \nCarrows as his deputies. . . well, that's your lookout, isn't it? \n\nYou say you're prepared to die.\" \n\n \"But what . . . ?\" said Hermione, frowning at Ariana's picture. \n\n A tiny white dot reappeared at the end of the painted tunnel, and now Ariana was \nwalking back toward them, growing bigger and bigger \n\nas she came. But there was somebody else with her now, someone taller than she was, \nwho was limping along, looking excited. His hair was \n\n\f\nlonger than Harry had ever seen. He appeared and torn. Larger and larger the two figures \ngrew, until only their heads and shoulders filled the portrait. \n\nThen the whole thing swang forward on the wall like a little door, and the entrance to a \nreal tunnel was revealed. And our of it, his hair overgrown, \n\nhis face cut, his robes ripped, clambered the real Neville Longbottom, who gave a roar of \ndelight, leapt down from the mantelpiece and yelled. \n\n\"I knew you'd come! I knew it, Harry!\" \n\n \n\nChapter Twenty-Nine \n\nThe Lost Diadem \n\n\u201cNeville -- what the -- how -- ?\u201d \n\n But Neville had spotted Ron and Hermione, and with yells of delight was hugging \nthem too. The longer Harry looked at Neville, the worse he appeared: One of his eyes \nwas swollen yellow and purple, there were gouge marks on his face, and his general air of \nunkemptness suggested that he had been living enough. Nevertheless, his battered visage \nshone with happiness as he let go of Hermione and said again, \u201cI knew you\u2019d come! Kept \ntelling Seamus it was a matter of time!\u201d \n\n \u201cNeville, what\u2019s happened to you?\u201d \n\n \u201cWhat? This?\u201d Neville dismissed his injuries with a shake of the head. \u201cThis is \nnothing, Seamus is worse. You\u2019ll see. Shall we get going then? Oh,\u201d he turned to \nAberforth, \u201cAb, there might be a couple more people no the way.\u201d \n\n \u201cCouple more?\u201d repeated Aberforth ominously. \u201cWhat d\u2019you mean, a couple \nmore, Longbottom? There\u2019s a curfew and a Camwaulding Charm on the whole village!\u201d \n\n \u201cI know, that\u2019s why they\u2019ll be Apparating directly into the bar,\u201d said Neville. \n\u201cJust send them down the passage when they get here, will you? Thanks a lot.\u201d \n\n Neville held out his hand to Hermione and helped her to climb up onto the \nmantelpiece and into the tunnel; Ron followed, then Neville. Harry addressed Aberforth. \n\n \u201cI don\u2019t know how to thank you. You\u2019ve saved our lives twice.\u201d \n\n \u201cLook after \u2018em, then,\u201d said Aberforth gruffly. \u201cI might not be able to save \u2018em a \nthird time.\u201d \n\n Harry chambered up onto the mantelpiece and through the hole behind Ariana\u2019s \nportrait. There were smooth stone steps on the other side: It looked as though the \npassageway had been there for years. Brass lamps hung from the walls and the earthy \nfloor was worn and smooth; as they walked, their shadows rippled, fanlike, across the \nwall. \n\n \u201cHow long\u2019s this been here?\u201d Ron asked as they set off. \u201cIt isn\u2019t on the \nMarauder\u2019s Map, is it Harry? I thought there were only seven passages in and out of \nschool?\u201d \n\n \u201cThey sealed off all of those before the start of the year,\u201d said Neville. \u201cThere\u2019s \nno chance of getting through any of them now, not with the curses over the entrances and \nDeath Eaters and dementors waiting at the exits.\u201d He started walking backward, beaming, \ndrinking them in. \u201cNever mind that stuff \u2026 Is it true? Did you break into Gringotts? Did \nyou escape on a dragon? It\u2019s everywhere, everyone\u2019s talking about it, Terry Boot got \nbeaten up by Carrow for yelling about it in the Great Hall at dinner!\u201d \n\n\f\n \u201cYeah, it\u2019s true,\u201d said Harry. \n\n Neville laughed gleefully. \n\n \u201cWhat did you do with the dragon?\u201d \n\n \u201cReleased it into the wild,\u201d said Ron. \u201cHermione was all for keeping it as a pet\u201c \n\n \u201cDon\u2019t exaggerate, Ron \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cBut what have you been doing? People have been saying you\u2019ve just been on the \nrun, Harry, but I don\u2019t think so. I think you\u2019ve been up to something.\u201d \n\n \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbut tell us about Hogwarts, Neville, we haven\u2019t heard \nanything.\u201d \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s been \u2026. Well, it\u2019s not really like Hogwarts anymore,\u201d said Neville, the smile \nfading from his face as he spoke. \u201cDo you know about the Carrows?\u201d \n\n \u201cThose two Death Eaters who teach here?\u201d \n\n \u201cThey do more than teach,\u201d said Neville. \u201cThey\u2019re in charge of all discipline. \nThey like punishment, the Carrows.\u201d \n\n \u201cLike Umbridge?\u201d \n\n \u201cNah, they make her look tame. The other teachers are all supposed to refer us to \nthe Carrows if we do anything wrong. They don\u2019t, though, if they can avoid it. You can \ntell they all hate them as much as we do.\u201d \n\n \u201cAmycus, the bloke, he teaches what used to be Defense Against the Dark Arts, \nexcept now it\u2019s just the Dark Arts. We\u2019re supposed to practice the Cruciatus Curse on \npeople who\u2019ve earned detentions \u2013 \u201c \n\n \u201cWhat?\u201d \n\n Harry, Ron, and Hermione\u2019s united voices echoed up and down the passage. \n\n \u201cYeah,\u201d said Neville. \u201cThat\u2019s how I got this one,\u201d he pointed at a particularly \ndeep gash in his cheek, \u201cI refused to do it. Some people are into it, though; Crabbe and \nGoyle love it. First time they\u2019ve ever been top in anything, I expect.\u201d \n\n \u201cAlecto, Amycus\u2019s sister, teaches Muggle Studies, which is compulsory for \neveryone. We\u2019ve all got to listen to her explain how Muggles are like animals, stupid and \ndirty, and how they drive wizards into hiding by being vicious toward them, and how the \nnatural order is being reestablished. I got this one,\u201d he indicated another slash to his face, \n\u201cfor asking her how much Muggle blood she and her brother have got.\u201d \n\n \u201cBlimey, Neville,\u201d said Ron, \u201cthere\u2019s a time and a place for getting a smart \nmouth.\u201d \n\n \u201cYou didn\u2019t see her,\u201d said Neville. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have stood it either. The thing \nis, it helps when people stand up to them, it gives everyone hope. I used to notice that \nwhen you did it, Harry.\u201d \n\n \u201cBut they\u2019ve used you as a knife sharpener,\u201d said Ron, winding slightly as they \npassed a lamp and Neville\u2019s injuries were thrown into even greater relief. \n\n Neville shrugged. \n\n \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. They don\u2019t want to spill too much pure blood, so they\u2019ll torture \nus a bit if we\u2019re mouthy but they won\u2019t actually kill us.\u201d \n\n Harry did not know what was worse, the things that Neville was saying or the \nmatter-of-fact tone in which he said them. \n\n \u201cThe only people in real danger are the ones whose friends and relatives on the \noutside are giving trouble. They get taken hostage. Old Xeno Lovegood was getting a bit \n\n\f\ntoo outspoken in The Quibbler, so they dragged Luna off the train on the way back for \nChristmas.\u201d \n\n \u201cNeville, she\u2019s all right, we\u2019ve seen her \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cYeah, I know, she managed to get a message to me.\u201d \n\n From his pocket he pulled a golden coin, and Harry recognized it as one of the \nfake Galleons that Dumbledore\u2019s Army had used to send one another messages. \n\n \u201cThese have been great,\u201d said Neville, beaming at Hermione. \u201cThe Carrows never \nrumbled how we were communicating, it drove them mad. We used to sneak out at night \nand put graffiti on the walls: Dumbledore\u2019s Army, Still Recruiting, stuff like that. Snape \nhated it.\u201d \n\n \u201cYou used to?\u201d said Harry, who had noticed the past tense. \n\n \u201cWell, it got more difficult as time went one,\u201d said Neville. \u201cWe lost Luna at \nChristmas, and Ginny never came back after Easter, and the three of us were sort of the \nleaders. The Carrows seemed to know I was behind a lot of it, so they started coming \ndown on me hard, and then Michael Corner went and got caught releasing a first-year \nthey\u2019d chained up, and they tortured him pretty badly. That scared people off.\u201d \n\n \u201cNo kidding,\u201d muttered Ron, as the passage began to slope upward. \n\n \u201cYeah, well, I couldn\u2019t ask people to go through what Michael did, so we dropped \nthose kinds of stunts. But we were still fighting, doing underground stuff, right up until a \ncouple of weeks ago. That\u2019s when they decided there was only one way to stop me, I \nsuppose, and they went for Gran.\u201d \n\n \u201cThey what?\u201d said Harry, Ron, and Hermione together. \n\n \u201cYeah,\u201d said Neville, panting a little now, because the passage was climbing so \nsteeply, \u201cwell, you can see their thinking. It had worked really well, kidnapping kids to \nforce their relatives to behave. I s\u2019pose it was only a matter of time before they did it the \nother way around. Thing was,\u201d he faced them, and Harry was astonished to see that he \nwas grinning, \u201cthey bit off a bit more than they could chew with Gran. Little old witch \nliving alone, they probably thought hey didn\u2019t need to send anyone particularly powerful. \nAnyway,\u201d Neville laughed, \u201cDawlish is still in St. Mungo\u2019s and Gran\u2019s on the run. She \nsent me a letter,\u201d he clapped a hand to the breast pocket of his robes, \u201ctelling me she was \nproud of me, that I\u2019m my parent\u2019s son, and to keep it up.\u201d \n\n \u201cCool,\u201d said Ron. \n\n \u201cYea,\u201d said Neville happily. \u201cOnly thing was, once they realized they had no hold \nover me, they decided Hogwarts could do without me after all. I don\u2019t know whether they \nwere planning to kill me or send me to Azkaban, either way, I knew it was time to \ndisappear.\u201d \n\n \u201cBut,\u201d said Ron, looking thoroughly confused, \u201caren\u2019t \u2013 aren\u2019t we heading \nstraight back for Hogwarts?\u201d \n\n \u201c\u2019Course,\u201d said Neville. \u201cYou\u2019ll see. We\u2019re here.\u201d \n\n They turned a corner and there ahead of them was the end of the passage. Another \nshort flight of steps led to a door just like the one hidden behind Ariana\u2019s portrait. Neville \npushed it open and climbed through. As Harry followed, he heard Neville call out for \nunseen people: \n\n \u201cLook who it is! Didn\u2019t I tell you?\u201d \n\n As Harry emerged into the room behind the passage, there were several screams \nand yells: \u201cHARRY!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s Potter, it\u2019s POTTER!\u201d \u201cRon!\u201d \u201cHermione!\u201d \n\n\f\n He had a confused impression of colored hangings, of lamps and many faces. The \nnext moment, he, Ron, and Hermione were engulfed, hugged, pounded on the back, their \nhair ruffled, their hands shaken, by what seemed to be more than twenty people. They \nmight have just won a Quidditch final. \n\n \u201cOkay, okay, calm down!\u201d Neville called, and as the crowd backed away, Harry \nwas able to take in their surroundings. \n\n He did not recognize the dorm at all. It was enormous, and looked rather like the \ninterior of a particularly sumptuous tree house, or perhaps a gigantic ship\u2019s cabin. \nMulticolored hammocks were strung from the ceiling and from the balcony that ran \naround the dark wood-paneled and windowless walls, which were covered in bright \ntapestry hangings. Harry saw the gold Gryffindor lion, emblazoned on scarlet; the black \nbadger of Hufflepuff, set against yellow; and the bronze eagle of Ravenclaw, on blue. \nThe silver and green of Slytherin alone were absent. There were bulging bookcases, a few \nbroomsticks propped against the walls, and in the corner, a large wood-cased wireless. \n\n \u201cWhere are we?\u201d \n\n \u201cRoom of Requirement, of course!\u201d said Neville. \u201cSurpassed itself, hasn\u2019t it? The \nCarrows were chasing me, and I knew I had just one chance for a hideout: I managed to \nget through the door and this is what I found! Well, it wasn\u2019t exactly like this when I \narrived, it was a load smaller, there was only one hammock and just Gryffindor hangings. \nBut it\u2019s expanded as more and more of the D.A. have arrived.\u201d \n\n \u201cAnd the Carrows can\u2019t get in?\u201d asked Harry, looking around for the door. \n\n \u201cNo,\u201d said Seamus Finnigan, whom Harry had not recognized until he spoke: \nSeamus\u2019s face was bruised and puffy. \u201cIt\u2019s a proper hideout, as long as one of us stays in \nhere, they can\u2019t get at us, the door won\u2019t open. It\u2019s all down to Neville. He really gets this \nroom. You\u2019ve got to ask for exactly what you need \u2013 like, \u201cI don\u2019t want any Carrow \nsupporters to be able to get in\u2019 \u2013 and it\u2019ll do it for you! You\u2019ve just got to make sure you \nclose the loopholes. Neville\u2019s the man!\u201d \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s quite straightforward, really,\u201d said Neville modestly. \u201cI\u2019d been in here about \na day and a half, and getting really hungry, and wishing I could get something to eat, and \nthat\u2019s when the passage to Hog\u2019s Head opened up. I went through it and met Aberforth. \nHe\u2019s been providing us with food, because for some reason, that\u2019s the one thing the room \ndoesn\u2019t really do. \n\n \u201cYeah, well, food\u2019s one of the five exceptions to Gamp\u2019s Law of Elemental \nTransfiguration,\u201d said Ron to general astonishment. \n\n \u201cSo we\u2019ve been hiding out here for nearly two weeks,\u201d said Seamus, \u201cand it just \nmakes more hammocks every time we need room, and it even sprouted a pretty good \nbathroom once girls started turning up \u2013 \u201c \n\n \u201c\u2014and thought they\u2019d quite like to wash, yes,\u201d supplied Lavender Brown, whom \nHarry had not noticed until that point. Now that he looked around properly, he recognized \nmany familiar faces. Both Patil twins were there, as were Terry Boot, Ernie Macmillan, \nAnthony Goldstein, and Michael Corner. \n\n \u201cTell us what you\u2019ve been up to, though,\u201d said Ernie. \u201cThere\u2019ve been so many \nrumors, we\u2019ve been trying to keep up with you on Potterwatch.\u201d He pointed at the \nwireless. \u201cYou didn\u2019t break into Gringotts?\u201d \n\n \u201cThey did!\u201d said Neville. \u201cAnd the dragon\u2019s true too!\u201d \n\n There was a smattering of applause and a few whoops; Ron took a bow. \n\n\f\n \u201cWhat were you after?\u201d asked Seamus eagerly. \n\n Before any of them could parry the question with one of their own, Harry felt a \nterrible, scorching pain in the lightning scar. As he turned his back hastily on the curious \nand delighted faces, the Room of Requirement vanished, and he was standing inside a \nruined stone shack, and the rotting floorboards were ripped apart at his feet, a disinterred \ngolden box lay open and empty beside the hole, and Voldemort\u2019s scream of fury vibrated \ninside his head. \n\n With an enormous effort he pulled out of Voldemort\u2019s mind again, back to where \nhe stood, swaying, in the Room of Requirement, sweat pouring from his face and Ron \nholding him up. \n\n \u201cAre you all right, Harry?\u201d Neville was saying. \u201cWhat to sit down? I expect \nyou\u2019re tired, aren\u2019t -- ?\u201d \n\n \u201cNo,\u201d said Harry. He looked at Ron and Hermione, trying to tell them without \nwords that Voldemort had just discovered the loss of one of the other Horcruxes. Time \nwas running out fast: If Voldemort chose to visit Hogwarts next, they would miss their \nchance. \n\n \u201cWe need to get going,\u201d he said, and their expressions told him that they \nunderstood. \n\n \u201cWhat are we going to do, then, Harry?\u201d asked Seamus. \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan?\u201d \n\n \u201cPlan?\u201d repeated Harry. He was exercising all his willpower to prevent himself \nsuccumbing again to Voldemort\u2019s rage: His scar was still burning. \u201cWell, there\u2019s \nsomething we \u2013 Ron, Hermione, and I \u2013 need to do, and then we\u2019ll get out of here.\u201d \n\n Nobody was laughing or whooping anymore. Neville looked confused. \n\n \u201cWhat d\u2019you mean, \u2018get out of here\u2019?\u201d \n\n \u201cWe haven\u2019t come back to stay,\u201d said Harry, rubbing his scar, trying to soothe the \npain. \u201cThere\u2019s something important we need to do \u2013 \u201c \n\n \u201cWhat is it?\u201d \n\n \u201cI \u2013 I can\u2019t tell you.\u201d \n\n There was a ripple of muttering at this: Neville\u2019s brows contracted. \n\n \u201cWhy can\u2019t you tell us? It\u2019s something to do with fighting You-Know-Who, \nright?\u201d \n\n \u201cWell, yeah \u2013 \u201c \n\n \u201cThen we\u2019ll help you.\u201d \n\n The other members of Dumbledore\u2019s Army were nodding, some enthusiastically, \nothers solemnly. A couple of them rose from their chairs to demonstrate their willingness \nfor immediate action. \n\n \u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d Harry seemed to have said that a lot in the last few hours. \n\u201cWe \u2013 we can\u2019t tell you. We\u2019ve got to do it \u2013 alone.\u201d \n\n \u201cWhy?\u201d asked Neville. \n\n \u201cBecause \u2026 \u201c In his desperation to start looking for the missing Horcrux, or at \nleast have a private discussion with Ron and Hermione about where they might \ncommence their search. Harry found it difficult to gather his thoughts. His scar was still \nsearing. \u201cDumbledore left the three of us a job,\u201d he said carefully, \u201cand we weren\u2019t \nsupposed to tell \u2013 I mean, he wanted us to do it, just the three of us.\u201d \n\n \u201cWe\u2019re his army,\u201d said Neville. \u201cDumbledore\u2019s Army. We were all in it together, \nwe\u2019ve been keeping it going while you three have been off on your own \u2013\u201c \n\n\f\n \u201cIt hasn\u2019t exactly been a picnic, mate,\u201d said Ron. \n\n \u201cI never said it had, but I don\u2019t see why you can\u2019t trust us. Everyone in this \nroom\u2019s been fighting and they\u2019ve been driven in here because the Carrows were hunting \nthem down. Everyone in here\u2019s proven they\u2019re loyal to Dumbledore \u2013 loyal to you.\u201d \n\n \u201cLook,\u201d Harry began, without knowing what he was going to say, but it did not \nmatter. The tunnel door had just opened behind him. \n\n \u201cWe got your message, Neville! Hello you three, I thought you must be here!\u201d \n\n It was Luna and Dean. Seamus gave a great roar of delight and ran to hug his best \nfriend. \n\n \u201cHi, everyone!\u201d said Luna happily. \u201cOh, it\u2019s great to be back!\u201d \n\n \u201cLuna,\u201d said Harry distractedly, \u201cwhat are you doing here? How did you -- ?\u201d \n\n \u201cI sent for her,\u201d said Neville, holding up the fake Galleon. \u201cI promised her and \nGinny that if you turned up I\u2019d let them know. We all thought that if you came back, it \nwould mean revolution. That we were going to overthrow Snape and the Carrows.\u201d \n\n \u201cOf course that\u2019s what it means,\u201d said Luna brightly. \u201cIsn\u2019t it, Harry? We\u2019re \ngoing to fight them out of Hogwarts?\u201d \n\n \u201cListen,\u201d said Harry with a rising sense of panic, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s not what \nwe came back for. There\u2019s something we\u2019ve got to do, and then \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cYou\u2019re going to leave us in this mess?\u201d demanded Michael Cornet. \n\n \u201cNo!\u201d said Ron. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing will benefit everyone in the end, it\u2019s all about \ntrying to get rid of You-Know-Who \u2013 \u201c \n\n \u201cThen let us help!\u201d said Neville angrily. \u201cWe want to be a part of it!\u201d \n\n There was another noise behind them, and Harry turned. His heart seemed to fall: \nGinny was now climbing through the hole in the wall, closely followed by Fred, George, \nand Lee Jordan. Ginny gave Harry a radiant smile: He had forgotten, he had never fully \nappreciated, how beautiful she was, but he had never been less pleased to see her. \n\n \u201cAberforth\u2019s getting a bit annoyed,\u201d said Fred, raising his hand in answer to \nseveral cries of greeting. \u201cHe wants a kip, and his bar\u2019s turned into a railway station.\u201d \n\n Harry\u2019s mouth fell open. Right behind Lee Jordan came Harry\u2019s old girlfriend, \nCho Chang. She smiled at him. \n\n \u201cI got the message,\u201d she said, holding up her own fake Galleon and she walked \nover to sit beside Michael Corner. \n\n \u201cSo what\u2019s the plan, Harry?\u201d said George. \n\n \u201cThere isn\u2019t one,\u201d said Harry, still disoriented by the sudden appearance of all \nthese people, unable to take everything in while his scar was still burning so fiercely. \n\n \u201cJust going to make it up as we go along, are we? My favorite kind,\u201d said Fred. \n\n \u201cYou\u2019ve got to stop this!\u201d Harry told Neville. \u201cWhat did you call them all back \nfor? This is insane \u2013 \u201c \n\n \u201cWe\u2019re fighting, aren\u2019t we?\u201d said Dean, taking out his fake Galleon. \u201cThe \nmessage said Harry was back, and we were going to fight! I\u2019ll have to get a wand, though \n\u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cYou haven\u2019t got a wand--?\u201d began Seamus. \n\n Ron turned suddenly to Harry. \n\n \u201cWhy can\u2019t they help?\u201d \n\n \u201cWhat?\u201d \n\n\f\n \u201cThey can help.\u201d He dropped his voice and said, so that none of them could hear \nbut Hermione, who stood between them, \u201cWe don\u2019t know where it is. We\u2019ve got to find it \nfast. We don\u2019t have to tell them it\u2019s a Horcrux.\u201d \n\n Harry looked from Ron to Hermione, who murmured, \u201cI think Ron\u2019s right. We \ndon\u2019t even know what we\u2019re looking for, we need them.\u201d And when Harry looked \nunconvinced, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do everything alone, Harry.\u201d \n\n Harry thought fast, his scar still prickling, his head threatening to split again. \nDumbledore had warned him against telling anyone but Ron and Hermione about the \nHorcruxes. Secrets and lies, that\u2019s how we grew up, and Albus \u2026 he was a natural \u2026 \nWas he turning into Dumbledore, keeping his secrets clutched to his chest, afraid to trust? \nBut Dumbledore had trusted Snape, and where had that led? To murder at the top of the \nhighest tower \u2026 \n\n \u201cAll right,\u201d he said quietly to the other two. \u201cOkay,\u201d he called to the room at large, \nand all noise ceased: Fred and George, who had been cracking jokes for the benefit of \nthose nearest, fell silent, and all of the looked alert, excited. \n\n \u201cThere\u2019s something we need to find,\u201d Harry said. \u201cSomething \u2013 something that\u2019ll \nhelp us overthrow You-Know-Who. It\u2019s here at Hogwarts, but we don\u2019t know where. It \nmight have belonged to Ravenclaw. Has anyone heard of an object like that? Has anyone \ncome across something with her eagle on it, for instance?\u201d \n\n He looked hopefully toward the little group of Ravenclaws, to Padma, Michael, \nTerry, and Cho, but it was Luna who answered, perched on the arm of Ginny\u2019s chair. \n\n \u201cWell, there\u2019s her lost diadem. I told you about it, remember, Harry? The lost \ndiadem of Ravenclaw? Daddy\u2019s trying to duplicate it.\u201d \n\n \u201cYeah, but the lost diadem,\u201d said Michael Corner, rolling his eyes, \u201cis lost, Luna. \nThat\u2019s sort of the point.\u201d \n\n \u201cWhen was it lost?\u201d asked Harry. \n\n \u201cCenturies ago, they say,\u201d said Cho, and Harry\u2019s heart sank. \u201cProfessor Flitwick \nsays the diadem vanished with Ravenclaw herself. People have looked, but,\u201d she \nappealed to her fellow Ravenclaws. \u201cNobody\u2019s ever found a trace of it, have them?\u201d \n\n They all shook their heads. \n\n \u201cSorry, but what is a diadem?\u201d asked Ron. \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of crown,\u201d said Terry Boot. \u201cRavenclaw\u2019s was supposed to have \nmagical properties, enhance the wisdom of the wearer.\u201d \n\n \u201cYes, Daddy\u2019s Wrackspurt siphons \u2013 \u201c \n\n But Harry cut across Luna. \n\n \u201cAnd none of you have ever seen anything that looks like it? \n\n They all shook their heads again. Harry looked at Ron and Hermione and his own \ndisappointment was mirrored back at him. An object that had been lost this long, and \napparently without trace, did not seem like a good candidate for the Horcrux hidden in \nthe castle \u2026 Before he could formulate a new question, however, Cho spoke again. \n\n \u201cIf you\u2019d like to see what the diadem\u2019s supposed to look like, I could take you up \nto our common room and show you, Harry. Ravenclaw\u2019s wearing it in her statue.\u201d \n\n Harry\u2019s scar scorched again: For a moment the Room of Requirement swam \nbefore him, and he saw instead the dark earth soaring beneath him and felt the great \nsnake wrapped around his shoulders. Voldemort was flying again, whether to the \n\n\f\nunderground lake or here, to the castle, he did not know: Either way, there was hardly \nany time left. \n\n \u201cHe\u2019s on the move,\u201d he said quietly to Ron and Hermione. He glanced at Cho and \nthen back at them. \u201cListen, I know it\u2019s not much of a lead, but I\u2019m going to go look at \nthis statue, at least find out what the diadem looks like. Wait for me here and keep, you \nknow \u2013 the other one \u2013 safe.\u201d \n\n Cho had got to her feet, but Ginny said rather fiercely, \u201cNo, Luna will take Harry, \nwon\u2019t you, Luna?\u201d \n\n \u201cOooh, yes, I\u2019d like to,\u201d said Luna happily, as Cho sat down again, looking \ndisappointed. \n\n \u201cHow do we get out?\u201d Harry asked Neville. \n\n \u201cOver here.\u201d \n\n \u201cHe led Harry and Luna to a corner, where a small cupboard opened onto a steep \nstaircase. \u201cIt comes out somewhere different every day, so they\u2019ve never been able to \nfind it,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly trouble is, we never know exactly where we\u2019re going to end up \nwhen we go out. Be careful, Harry, they\u2019re always patrolling the corridors at night.\u201d \n\n \u201cNo problem,\u201d said Harry. \u201cSee you in a bit.\u201d \n\n He and Luna hurried up the staircase, which was long, lit by torches, and turned \ncorners in unexpected places. At last they reached what appeared to be solid wall. \n\n \u201cGet under here,\u201d Harry told Luna, pulling out the Invisibility Cloak and throwing \nit over both of them. He gave the wall a little push. \n\n It melted away at his touch and they slipped outside. Harry glanced back and saw \nthat it had resealed itself at once. They were standing in a dark corridor. Harry pulled \nLuna back into the shadows, fumbled in the pouch around his neck, and took out the \nMarauder\u2019s Map. Holding it close to his nose he searched, and located his and Luna\u2019s \ndots at last. \n\n \u201cWe\u2019re up on the fifth floor,\u201d he whispered, watching filch moving away from \nthem, a corridor ahead. \u201cCome on, this way.\u201d \n\n They crept off. \n\n Harry had prowled the castle at night many times before, but never had his heart \nhammered that fast, never had so much depended on his safe passage through the place. \nThrough squares of moonlight upon the floor, past suits of armor whose helmets creaked \nat the sound of their soft footsteps, around corners beyond which who knew what lurked. \nHarry and Luna walked, checking the Marauder\u2019s Map whenever light permitted, twice \npausing to allow a ghost to pass without drawing attention to themselves. He expected to \nencounter an obstacle at any moment; his worst fear was Peeves, and he strained his ears \nwith every step to hear the first, telltale signs of the poltergeist\u2019s approach. \n\n \u201cThe way, Harry,\u201d breathed Luna, plucking his sleeve and pulling him toward a \nspiral staircase. \n\n They climbed in tight, dizzying circles; Harry had never been up here before. At \nlast they reached a door. There was no handle and no keyhole: nothing but a plain \nexpanse of aged wood, and a bronze knocker in the shape an eagle. \n\n Luna reached out a pale hand, which looked eerie floating in midair, unconnected \nto arm or body. She knocked once, and in the silence it sounded to Harry like a cannon \nblast. At once the beak of the eagle opened, but instead of a bird\u2019s called, a soft, musical \nvoice said, \u201cWhich came first, the phoenix or the flame?\u201d \n\n\f\n \u201cHmm \u2026 What do you think, Harry?\u201d said Luna, looking thoughtful. \n\n \u201cWhat? Isn\u2019t there a password?\u201d \n\n \u201cOh no, you\u2019ve got to answer a question,\u201d said Luna. \n\n \u201cWhat if you get it wrong?\u201d \n\n \u201cWell, you have to wait for somebody who gets it right,\u201d said Luna. \u201cThat way \nyou learn, you see?\u201d \n\n \u201cYeah \u2026 Trouble is, we can\u2019t really afford to wait for anyone else, Luna.\u201d \n\n \u201cNo, I see what you mean,\u201d said Luna seriously. \u201cWell then, I think the answer is \nthat a circle has no beginning.\u201d \n\n \u201cWell reasoned,\u201d said the voice, and the door swung open. \n\n The deserted Ravenclaw common room was a wide, circular room, airier than any \nHarry had ever seen at Hogwarts. Graceful arched windows punctuated the walls, which \nwere hung with blue-and-bronze silks. By day, the Ravenclaws would have a spectacular \nview of the surrounding mountains. The ceiling was domed and painted with stars, which \nwere echoed in the midnight-blue carpet. There were tables, chairs, and bookcases, and in \na niche opposite the door stood a tall statue of white marble. \n\n Harry recognized Rowena Ravenclaw from the bust he had seen at Luna\u2019s house. \nThe statue stood beside a door that led, he guessed, to dormitories above. He strode right \nup to the marble woman, and she seemed to look back at him with a quizzical half smile \non her face, beautiful yet slightly intimidating. A delicate-looking circlet had been \nreproduced in marble on top of her head. It was not unlike the tiara Fleur had worn at her \nwedding. There were tiny words etched into it. Harry stepped out from under the Cloak \nand climbed up onto Ravenclaw\u2019s plinth to read them. \n\n \u201c\u2019Wit beyond measure is man\u2019s greatest treasure.\u2019\u201d \n\n \u201cWhich makes you pretty skint, witless,\u201d said a cackling voice. \n\n Harry whirled around, slipped off the plinth, and landed on the floor. The sloping-\nshouldered figure of Alecto Carrow was standing before him, and even as Harry raised \nhis wand, she pressed a stubby forefinger to the skull and snake branded on her forearm. \n\nChapter Thirty \n\nThe Sacking of Severus Snape \n\n The moment her finger touched the Mark, Harry's scar burned savagely, the starry \nroom vanished from sight, and he was standing upon an outcrop of rock beneath a cliff, \nand the sea was washing around him and there was a triumph in his heart \u2013 They have the \nboy. \n\n A loud bang brought Harry back to where he stood. Disoriented, he raised his \nwand, but the witch before him was already falling forward; she hit the ground so hard \nthat the glass in the bookcases tinkled. \n\n \u201cI've never Stunned anyone except in our D.A. lessons,\u201d said Luna, sounding \nmildly interested. \u201cThat was noisier than I though it would be.\u201d \n\n And sure enough, the ceiling had begun to tremble Scurrying, echoing footsteps \nwere growing louder from behind the door leading to the dormitories. Luna's spell had \nwoken Ravenclaws sleeping above. \n\n \u201cLuna, where are you? I need to get under the Cloak!\u201d \n\n\f\n Luna's feet appeared out of nowhere,; he hurried to her side and she let the Cloak \nfall back over them as the door opened and a stream of Ravenclaws, all in their \nnightclothes, flooded into the common room. there were gasps and cries of surprise as \nthey saw Alecto lying there unconscious. Slowly they shuffled in around her, a savage \nbeast that might wake at any moment and attack them. Then one brave little first-year \ndarted up to her and prodded her backside with his big toe. \n\n \u201cI think she might be dead!\u201d he shouted with delight. \n\n \u201cOh look,\u201d whispered Luna happily, as the Ravenclaws crowded in around Alecto. \n\u201cThey're pleased!\u201d \n\n \u201cYeah... great... \u201c \n\n Harry closed his eyes, and as his scar throbbed he chose to sink again into \nVoldemort's mind.... He was moving along the tunnel into the first cave.... He had \nchosen to make sure of the locker before coming...but that would not take him long.... \n\n There was a rap on the common room door and every Ravenclaw froze. From the \nother side, Harry heard the soft, musical voice that issued from the eagle door knocker: \n\u201cWhere do Vanished objects go?\u201d \n\n \u201cI dunno, do I? Shut it!\u201d snarled an uncouth voice that Harry knew was that of \nthe Carrow brother , Amycus, \u201cAlecto? Alecto? Are you there? Have you got him? \nOpen the door!\u201d \n\n The Ravenclaws were whispering amongst themselves, terrified. Then without \nwarning, there came a series of loud bangs, as though somebody was firing a gun into the \ndoor. \n\n \u201cALECTO! If he comes, and we haven't got Potter --d'you want to go the same \nway as the Malfoys? ANSWER ME!\u201d Amycus bellowed, shaking the door for all he \nwas worth, but still it did not open. The Ravenclaws were all backing away, and some of \nthe most frightened began scampering back up the stair case to their beds. Then, just as \nHarry was wondering whether he ought not to blast open the door and Stun Amycus \nbefore the Death Eater could do anything else, a second, most familiar voice rang out \nbeyond the door. \n\n \u201cMay I ask what you are doing, Professor Carrow?\u201d \n\n \u201cTrying\u2014to get-- through this damned-- door!\u201d shouted Amycus. \u201cGo and get \nFlitwick! Get him to open it, now!\u201d \n\n \u201cBut isn't your sister in there\u201d asked Professor McGonagall. \u201cDidn't Professor \nFlitwick let her in earlier this evening, at your urgent request? Perhaps she could open \nthe door for you? Then you needn't wake up half the castle.\u201d \n\n \u201cShe ain't answering, you old besom! You open it! Garn! Do it, now!\u201d \n\n \u201cCertainly, if you wish it,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, with awful coldness, \nThere was a genteel tap of the knocker and the musical voice asked again. \n\n \u201cWhere do Vanished objects go?\u201d \n\n \u201cInto non being, which is to say, everything,\u201d replied Professor McGonagall. \n\n \u201cNicely phrased,\u201d replied the eagle door knocker, and the door swung open. \n\n The few Ravenclaws who had remained behind sprinted for the stairs as Amycus \nburst over the threshold, brandishing his wand. Hunched like his sister, he had a pallid, \ndoughy face and tiny eyes, which fell at once on Alecto, sprawled motionless on the floor. \nHe let out a yell of fury and fear. \n\n\f\n \u201cWhat've they done, the little whelps?\u201d he screamed. \u201cI'll Cruciate the lot of 'em \ntill they tell me who did it---and what's the Dark Lord going to say?\u201d he shrieked, \nstanding over his sister and smacking himself on the forehead with his fist, \u201cWe haven't \ngot him, and they've gone and killed her!\u201d \n\n \u201cShe's only Stunned,\u201d said Professor McGonagall impatiently, who had stooped \ndown to examine Alecto. \u201cShe'll be perfectly all right.\u201d \n\n \u201cNo she bludgering well won't!\u201d bellowed Amycus. \u201cNot after the Dark Lord \ngets hold of her! She's gone and sent for him, I felt me Mark burn, and he thinks we've \ngot Potter!\u201d \n\n \u201c'Got Potter'?\u201d said Professor McGonagall sharply, \u201cWhat do you mean, 'got \nPotter'?\u201d \n\n \u201cHe told us Potter might try and get inside Ravenclaw Tower, and to send for him \nif we caught him!\u201d \n\n \u201cWhy would Harry Potter try to get inside Ravenclaw Tower! Potter belongs in \nmy House!\u201d \n\n Beneath the disbelief and anger, Harry heard a little strain of pride in her voice \nand affection for Minerva McGonagall gushed up inside him. \n\n \u201cWe was told he might come in here!\u201d said Carrow. \u201cI dunno why, do I?\u201d \n\n Professor McGonagall stood up and her beady eyes swept the room. Twice they \npassed right over the place where Harry and Luna stood. \n\n \u201cWe can push it off on the kids,\u201d said Amycus, his pig like face suddenly crafty. \n\u201cYeah, that's what we'll do. We'll say Alecto was ambushed by the kids, them kids up \nthere\u201d -- he looked up at the starry ceiling toward the dormitories -- \u201c and we'll say they \nforced her to pres her Mark, and that's why he got a false alarm.... He can punish them. \nCouple of kids more or less, what's the difference?\u201d \n\n \u201cOnly the difference between truth and lied, courage and cowardice,\u201d said \nProfessor McGonagall, who had turned pale, \u201ca difference, in short, which you and your \nsister seem unable to appreciate. But let me make one thing very clear. You are not \ngoing to pass off y9our many ineptitudes on the students of Hogwarts. I shall not permit \nit.\u201d \n\n \u201cExcuse me?\u201d \n\n Amycus moved forward until he was offensively close to Professor McGonagall, \nhis face within inches of hers. She refused to back away, but looked down at him as if he \nwere something disgusting she had found stuck to the lavatory seat. \n\n \u201cIt's not a case of what you'll permit, Minerva McGonagall. Your time's over. It's \nus what's in charge here now, and you'll back me up or you'll pay the price.\u201d \n\n And he spat in her face. \n\n Harry pulled the Cloak off himself, raised his wand, and said, \u201cYou shouldn't \nhave done that.\u201d \n\n As Amycus spun around, Harry shouted, \u201cCrucio!\u201d \n\n The Death Eater was lifted off his feet. He writhed through the air like a \ndrowning man, thrashing and howling in pain, and then, with a crunch and a shattering of \nglass, he smashed into the front of a bookcase and crumpled, insensible, to the floor. \n\n\u201cI see what Bellatrix meant,\u201d said Harry, the blood thundering through his brain, \u201cyou \nneed to really mean it.\u201d \n\n\f\n \u201cPotter!\u201d whispered Professor McGonagall, clutching her heart. \u201cPotter--- you're \nhere! What---? How---?\u201d She struggled to pull herself together. \u201cPotter, that was \nfoolish!\u201d \n\n \u201cHe spat at you,\u201d said Harry. \n\n \u201cPotter, I --- that was very --- gallant of you --- but don't you realize --?\u201d \n\n \u201cYeah, I do,\u201d Harry assured her. Somehow her panic steadied him. \u201cProfessor \nMcGonagall, Voldemort's on the way.\u201d \n\n \u201cOh, are we allowed to say the name now?\u201d asked Luna with an air of interest, \npulling off the Invisibility Cloak. The appearance of a second outlaw seemed to \noverwhelm Professor McGonagall, who staggered backward and fell into a nearby chair, \nclutching at the neck of her old tartan dressing gown. \n\n \u201cI don't think it makes any difference what we call him,\u201d Harry told Luna. \u201cHe \nalready knows where I am.\u201d \n\n In a distant part of Harry's brain, that part connected to the angry, burning scar, he \ncould see Voldemort sailing fast over the dark lake in the ghostly green boat.... He had \nnearly reached the island where the stone basin stood.... \n\n \u201cYou must flee,\u201d whispered Professor McGonagall, \u201cNow Potter, as quickly as \nyou can!\u201d \n\n \u201cI can't,\u201d said Harry, \u201cThere's something I need to do. Professor, so you know \nwhere the diadem of Ravenclaw is?\u201d \n\n \u201cThe d-diadem of Ravenclaw? Of course not --- hasn't it been lost for \ncenturies?\u201d She sat up a little straighter \u201cPotter, it was madness, utter madness, for you \nto enter this castle---\u201d \n\n \u201cI had to,\u201d said Harry. \u201cProfessor, there's something hidden here that I'm \nsupposed to find, and it could be the diadem--- if I could just speak to Professor Flitwick-\n--\u201d \n\n There was a sound of movement, of clinking glass. Amycus was coming round. \nBefore Harry or Luna could act, Professor McGonagall rose to her feet, pointed her wand \nat the groggy Death Eater, and said, \u201cImperio.\u201d \n\n Amycus got up, walked over to his sister, picked up her wand, then shuffled \nobediently to Professor McGonagall and handed it over along with his own. Then he lay \ndown on the floor beside Alecto. Professor McGonagall waved her wand again, and a \nlength of shimmering silver rope appeared out of thin air and snaked around the Carrows, \nbinding them tightly together. \n\n \u201cPotter,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, turning to face him again with superb \nindifference to the Carrows' predicament. \u201cif He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named does indeed \nknow that you are here---\u201d \n\n As she said it, a wrath that was like physical pain blazed through Harry, setting \nhis scar on fire, and for a second he looked down upon a basin whose potion had turned \nclear, and saw that no golden locket lay safe beneath the surface---. \n\n \u201cPotter, are you all right.\u201d said a voice, and Harry came back. He was clutching \nLuna's shoulder to steady himself. \n\n \u201cTime's running out, Voldemort's getting nearer, Professor, I'm acting on \nDumbledore's orders, I must find what he wanted me to find! But we've got to get the \nstudents out while I'm searching the castle--- It's me Voldemort wants, but he won't care \n\n\f\nabout killing a few more or less, not now---\u201d not now he knows I'm attacking Horcruxes, \nHarry finished the sentence in his head. \n\n \u201cYou're acting on Dumbledore's orders?\u201d she repeated with a look of dawning \nwonder. Then she drew herself up to her fullest height. \n\n \u201cWe shall secure the school against He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named while you \nsearch for this --- this object.\u201d \n\n \u201cIs that possible?\u201d \n\n \u201cI think so,\u201d said Professor McGonagall dryly, \u201cwe teachers are rather good at \nmagic, you know. I am sure we will be able to hold him off for a while if we all put our \nbest efforts into it. Of course, something will have to be done about Professor Snape---\u201d \n\n \u201cLet me ---\u201d \n\n \u201c---and if Hogwarts is about to enter a state of siege, with the Dark Lord at the \ngates, it would indeed be advisable to take as many innocent people out of the way as \npossible. With the Floo Network under observation, and Apparition impossible within \nthe grounds---\u201d \n\n \u201cThere's a way,\u201d said Harry quickly, and he explained about the passageway \nleading into the Hog's Head. \n\n \u201cPotter, we're talking about hundreds of students---\u201d \n\n \u201cI know, Professor, but if Voldemort and the Death Eaters are concentrating on \nthe school boundaries they won't be interested in anyone who's Disapparating out of \nHog's Head.\u201d \n\n \u201cThere's something in that,\u201d she agreed. She pointed her wand at the Carrows, \nand a silver net fell upon their bound bodies, tied itself around them, and hoisted them \ninto the air, where they dangled beneath the blue-and-gold ceiling like two large, ugly sea \ncreatures. \u201cCome. We must alert the other Heads of House. You'd better put that Cloak \nback on.\u201d \n\n She marched toward the door, and as she did so she raised her wand. From the tip \nburst three silver cats with spectacle markings around their eyes. the Patronuses ran \nsleekly ahead, filling the spiral staircase with silvery light, as Professor McGonagall, \nHarry, and Luna hurried back down. \n\n Along the corridors they raced, and one by one the Patronuses left them. Professor \nMcGonagall's tartan dressing gown rustled over the floor, and Harry and Luna jogged \nbehind her under the Cloak. \n\n They had descended two more floors when another set of quiet joined theirs. \nHarry, whose scar was still prickling, heard them first. He felt in the pouch around his \nneck for the Marauder's Map, but before he could take it our, McGonagall too seemed to \nbecome aware of their company. She halted, raised her wand ready to duel, and said, \n\u201cWho's there?\u201d \n\n \u201cIt is I,\u201d said a low voice. \n\n From behind a suit of armor stepped Severus Snape. \n\n Hatred boiled up in Harry at the sight of him. He had forgotten the details of \nSnape's appearance in the magnitude of his crimes, forgotten how his greasy black hair \nhung in curtains around his thin face, how his black eyes had a dead, cold look. He was \nnot wearing nightclothes, but was dressed in his usual black cloak, and he too was \nholding his wand ready for a fight. \n\n \u201cWhere are the Carrows?\u201d he asked quietly. \n\n\f\n \u201cWherever you told them to be, I expect, Severus,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \n\n Snape stepped nearer, and his eyes flitted over Professor McGonagall into the air \naround her, as if he knew that Harry was there. Harry held his wand up too, ready to \nattack. \n\n \u201cI was under the impression,\u201d said Snape, \u201cThat Alecto had apprehended an \nintruder.\u201d \n\n \u201cReally?\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cAnd what gave you that impression?\u201d \n\n Snape mad a slight flexing movement of his left arm, where the Dark Mark was \nbranded into his skin. \n\n \u201cOh, but naturally,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cYou Death Eaters have your \nown private means of communication, I forgot.\u201d \n\n Snape pretended not to have heard her. His eyes were still probing the air all \nabout her, and he was moving gradually closer, with an air of hardly noticing what he \nwas doing. \n\n \u201cI did not know that it was your night to patrol the corridors Minerva.\u201d \n\n \u201cYou have some objection?\u201d \n\n \u201cI wonder what could have brought you out of our bed at this late hour?\u201d \n\n \u201cI thought I heard a disturbance,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \n\n \u201cReally? But all seems calm.\u201d \n\n Snape looked into her eyes. \n\n \u201cHave you seen Harry Potter, Minerva? Because if you have. I must insist---\u201d \n\n Professor McGonagall moved faster than Harry could have believed. Her wand \nslashed through the air and for a split second Harry thought that Snape must crumple, \nunconscious, but the swiftness of his Shield Charm was such that McGonagall was \nthrown off balance. =She brandished her wand at a touch on the wall and it flew out of \nits bracket. Harry, about to curse Snape, was forced to pull Luna out of the way of the \ndescending flames, which became a ring of fire that filled the corridor and flew like a \nlasso at Snape--- \n\n Then it was no longer fire, but a great black serpent that McGonagall blasted to \nsmoke, which re-formed and solidified in seconds to become a swarm of pursuing \ndaggers. Snape avoided them only by forcing the suit of armor in front of him, and with \nechoing clangs the daggers sank, one after another, into its breast--- \n\n \u201cMinerva!\u201d said a squeaky voice, and looking behind him, still shielding Luna \nfrom flying spells, Harry saw Professors Flitwick and Sprout sprinting up the corridor \ntoward them in their nightclothes, with the enormous Professor Slughorn panting along at \nthe rear. \n\n \u201cNo!\u201d squealed Flitwick, raising his wand. \u201cYou'll do no more murder at \nHogwarts!\u201d \n\n Flitwick's spell hit the suit of armor behind which Snape had taken shelter. With \na clatter it came to life. Snape struggled free of the crushing arms and sent it flying back \ntoward his attackers. Harry and Luna had to dive sideways to avoid it as it smashed into \nthe wall and shattered. When Harry looked up again, Snape was in full flight, \nMcGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout all thundering after him. He hurtled through a \nclassroom door and, moments later, he heard McGonagall cry, \u201cCoward! COWARD!\u201d \n\n \u201cWhat's happened, what's happened?\u201d asked Luna. \n\n\f\n Harry dragged her to her feet and they raced along the corridor, trailing the \nInvisibility Cloak behind them, into the deserted classroom where Professors \nMcGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout were standing at a smashed window. \n\n \u201cHe jumped,\u201d said Professor McGonagall as Harry and Luna ran into the room. \n\n \u201cYou mean he's dead?\u201d Harry sprinted to the window, ignoring Flitwick's and \nSprout's yells of shock at his sudden appearance. \n\n \u201cNo, he's not dead,\u201d said McGonagall bitterly. \u201cUnlike Dumbledore, he was still \ncarrying a wand... and he seems to have learned a few tricks from his master.\u201d \n\n With a tingle of horror, Harry saw in the distance a huge, bat like shape flying \nthrough the darkness toward the perimeter wall. \n\n There were heavy footfalls behind them, and a great deal of puffing. Slughorn \nhad just caught up. \n\n \u201cHarry!\u201d he panted, massaging his immense chest beneath his emerald-green silk \npajamas. \u201cMy dear boy... what a surprise...Minerva, do please \nexplain...Severus...what...?\u201d \n\n \u201cOur headmaster is taking a short break,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, pointing at \nthe Snape-shaped hole in the window. \n\n \u201cProfessor!\u201d Harry shouted his hand on his forehead, He could see the Inferi-\nfilled lake sliding beneath him, and he felt a ghostly green boat bump into the \nunderground shore, and Voldemort lept from it with murder in his heart--- \n\n \u201cProfessor, we've got to barricade the school, he's coming now!\u201d \n\n \u201cVery well. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is coming,\u201d she told the other teachers. \nSprout and Flitwick gasped. Slughorn let out a low groan. \u201cPotter has work to do in the \ncastle on Dumbledore's orders. We need to put in place every protection of which we are \ncapable while Potter does what he needs to do.\u201d \n\n \u201cYou realize , of course, that nothing we do will be able to keep out You-Know-\nWho indefinitely?\u201d squeaked Flitwick. \n\n \u201cBut we can hold him up.\u201d said Professor Sprout. \n\n \u201cThank you, Pomona,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, and between the two witches \nthere passed a look of grim understanding. I suggest we establish basic protection \naround the place, then gather our students and meet in the Great Hall. Most must be \nevacuated, though if any of those who are over age wish to stay and fight, I think they \nought to be given the chance.\u201d \n\n \u201cAgreed,\u201d said Professor Sprout, already hurrying toward the door. \u201cI shall meet \nyou in the Great Hall in twenty minutes with my House.\u201d \n\n And as she jogged out of sight, they could hear her muttering, \u201cTentacula, Devil's \nSnare. And Snargaluff pods...yes, I'd like to see the Death Eaters fighting those.\u201d \n\n I can act from here,\u201d said Flitwick, and although he could barely see out of it, he \npointed his wand through the smashed window and started muttering incantations of great \ncomplexity. Harry heard a weird rushing noise, as though Flitwick had unleashed the \npower of the wind into the grounds. \n\n \u201cProfessor,\u201d Harry said, approaching the little Charms master. \u201cProfessor, I'm \nsorry to interrupt, but this is important. Have you got any idea where the diadem of \nRavenclaw is?\u201d \n\n\f\n \u201c---Protego Horribillis---the diadem of Ravenclaw?\u201d squeaked Flitwick. \u201cA little \nextra wisdom never goes amiss, Potter, but I hardly think it would be much use in this \nsituation!\u201d \n\n \u201cI only meant --- do you know where it is? Have you ever seen it?\u201d \n\n \u201cSeen it\u201d Nobody has seen it in living memory! Long since lost, boy.\u201d \n\n Harry felt a mixture of desperate disappointment and panic. What, then, was the \nHorcrux? \n\n \u201cWe shall meet you and your Ravenclaws in the Great Hall, Filius!\u201d said \nProfessor McGonagall, beckoning to Harry and Luna to follow her. \n\n They had just reached the door when Slughorn rumbled into speech. \n\n \u201cMy word,\u201d he puffed, pale and sweaty, his walrus mustache aquiver. \u201cWhat a \nto-do! I'm not at all sure whether this is wise, Minerva. He is bound to find a way in, \nyou know, and anyone who has tried to delay him will be in the most grievous peril---\u201d \n\n \u201cI shall expect you and the Slytherins in the Great Hall in twenty minutes also.\u201d \nsaid Professor McGonagall. \u201cIf you wish to leave with your students, we shall not stop \nyou. But if any of you attempt to sabotage our resistance or take up arms against us \nwithin this castle, then, Horace, we duel to kill.\u201d \n\n \u201cMinerva!\u201d he said, aghast. \n\n \u201cThe time has come for Slytherin House to decide upon its loyalties,\u201d interrupted \nProfessor McGonagall. \u201cGo and wake your students, Horace.\u201d \n\n Harry did not stay to watch Slughorn splutter. He and Luna stayed after Professor \nMcGonagall, who had taken up a position in the middle of the corridor and raised her \nwand. \n\n \u201cPiertotum---oh, for heaven's sake, Filch, not now---\u201d \n\n The aged caretaker had just come hobbling into view, shouting \u201cStudents out of \nbed! Students in the corridors!\u201d \n\n \u201cThey're supposed to be you blithering idiot!\u201d shouted McGonagall. \u201cNow go \nand do something constructive! Find Peeves!\u201d \n\n 'P-Peeves?\u201d stammered Filch as though he had never heard the name before. \n\n \u201cYes, Peeves, you fool, Peeves! Haven't you been complaining about him for a \nquarter of a century? Go and fetch him, at once. \n\n Filch evidently thought Professor McGonagall had taken leave of her senses, but \nhobbled away, hunch-shouldered, muttering under his breath. \n\n \u201cAnd now---Piertotum Locomator!\u201d cried Professor McGonagall. And all along \nthe corridor the statues and suits of armor jumped down from their plinths, and from the \nechoing crashes from the floors above and below, Harry knew that their fellows \nthroughout the castle had done the same. \n\n \u201cHogwarts is threatened!\u201d shouted Professor McGonagall. \u201cMan the boundaries, \nprotect us, do your duty to our school!\u201d \n\n Clattering and yelling, the horde of moving statues stampeded past Harry, some of \nthem smaller, others larger than life. There were animals too, and the clanking suits of \narmor brandished swords and spiked balls on chains. \n\n \u201cNow, Potter,\u201d said McGonagall., \u201cyou and Miss Lovegood had better return to \nyour friends and bring them to the Great Hall --- I shall rouse the other Gryffindors.\u201d \n\n They parted at the top of the next staircase, Harry and Luna turning back toward \nthe concealed entrance to the Room of Requirement. As they ran, they met crowds of \n\n\f\nstudents, most wearing traveling cloaks over their pajamas, being shepherded down to the \nGreat Hall by teachers and prefects. \n\n \u201cThat was Potter!\u201d \n\n \u201cHarry Potter!\u201d \n\n \u201cIt was him, I swear, I just saw him!\u201d \n\n \u201cBut Harry did not look back, and at last they reached the entrance to the Room of \nRequirement, Harry leaned against the enchanted wall, which opened to admit them, and \nhe and Luna sped back down the steep staircase. \n\n \u201cWh--?\u201d \n\n As the room came into view, Harry slipped down a few stairs in shock. It was \npacked, far more crowded than when he had last been in there. Kingsley and Lupin were \nlooking up at him, as were Oliver Wood, Katie Bell, Angelina Johnson and Alicia \nSpinnet, Bill and Fleur, and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. \n\n \u201cHarry, what's happening?\u201d said Lupin, meeting him at the foot of the stairs. \n\n \u201cVoldemort's on his way, they're barricading he school---Snape's run for it---What \nare you doing here? How did you know? \n\n \u201cWe sent messages to the rest of Dumbledore's Army,\u201d Fred explained. \u201cYou \ncouldn't expect everyone to miss the fun, Harry, and the D.A. let the Order of the Phoenix \nknow, and it all kind of snowballed.\u201d \n\n \u201cWhat first, Harry?\u201d called George. \u201cWhat's going on?\u201d \n\n \u201cThey're evacuating the younger kids and everyone's meeting in the Great Hall to \nget organized,\u201d Harry said. \u201cWe're fighting.\u201d \n\n There was a great roar and a surge toward the stairs, he was pressed back against \nhe wall as they ran past hi, the mingled members of the Order of the Phoenix, \nDumbledore's Army, and Harry's old Quidditch team, all with their wands drawn, \nheading up into the main castle. \n\n \u201cCome on, Luna,\u201d Dean called as he passed, holding out his free hand, she took it \nand followed him back up the stairs. \n\n The crowd was thinning. Only a little knot of people remained below in the \nRoom of Requirement, and Harry joine3d them. Mrs. Weasley was struggling with \nGinny. Around them stood Lupin, Fred, George, Bill and Fleur. \n\n \u201cYou're underage!\u201d Mrs. Weasley shouted at her daughter as Harry approached \n\u201cI won't permit it! The boys, yes, but you, you've got to go home!\u201d \n\n \u201cI won't!\u201d \n\n \u201cGinny's hair flew as she pulled her arm out of her mother's grip. \n\n \u201cI'm in Dumbledore's Army---\u201d \n\n \u201cA teenagers' gang!\u201d \n\n \u201cA teenagers' gang that's about to take him on, which no one else has dared to \ndo!\u201d said Fred. \n\n \u201cShe's sixteen!\u201d shouted Mrs. Weasley. \u201cShe's not old enough! What you two \nwere thinking bringing her with you\u2014-\u201d \n\n Fred and George looked slightly ashamed of themselves. \n\n Mom's right, Ginny,\u201d said Bill gently. \u201cYou can't do this. Everyone underage \nwill have to leave, it's only right.\u201d \n\n \u201cI can't go home!\u201d Ginny shouted, angry tears sparkling in her eyes. \u201cmy whole \nfamily's here, I can't stand waiting there alone and not knowing and --\u201d \n\n\f\n Her eyes met Harry's for the first time. She looked at him beseechingly, but he \nshook his head and she turned away bitterly. \n\n \u201cFine,\u201d she said, staring at the entrance to the tunnel back to the Hog's Head. \u201cI'll \nsay good-by now, then, and---\u201d \n\n There was a scuffling and a great thump. Someone else had clambered out of the \ntunnel, overbalanced slightly, and fallen. He pulled himself up no the nearest chair, \nlooked around through lopsided horn-rimmed glasses, and said, \u201cAm I too late? Has it \nstarted. I only just found out, so I --- I ---\u201d \n\n Percy spluttered into silence. Evidently he had not expected to run into most of \nhis family. There was a long moment of astonishment, broken by Fleur turning to Lupin \nand saying, in a wildly transparent attempt to break the tension. \u201cSo--- 'ow eez leetle \nTeddy?\u201d \n\n Lupin blinked at her, startled. The silence between the Weasleys seemed to be \nsolidifying, like ice. \n\n \u201cI --- oh yes--- he's fine!\u201d Lupin said loudly. \u201cyes, Tonks is with him--- at her \nmother's ---\u201d \n\n Percy and the other Weasleys were still staring at one another, frozen. \n\n \u201cHere, I've got a picture?\u201d Lupin shouted, pulling a photograph from inside his \njacket and showing it to Fleur and Harry, who saw a tiny baby with a tuft of bright \nturquoise hair, waving fat fists at the camera. \n\n \u201cI was a fool!\u201d Percy roared, so loudly that Lupin nearly dropped his photograph. \n\u201cI was an idiot, I was a pompous prat, I was a \u2013 a --\u201d \n\n \u201cMinistry-loving, family-disowning, power-hungry moron,\u201d said Fred. \n\n Percy swallowed. \n\n \u201cYes, I was!\u201d \n\n \u201cWell, you can't say fairer than that,\u201d said Fred, holding his hand out to Percy. \n\n Mrs. Weasley burst into tears,. She ran forward, pushed Fred aside, and pulled \nPercy into a strangling hug, while he patted her on the back, his eyes on his father. \n\n \u201cI'm sorry, Dad,\u201d Percy said. \n\n Mr. Weasley blinked rather rapidly, then he too hurried to hug his son. \n\n \u201cWhat made you see sense, Perce?\u201d inquired George. \n\n \u201cIt's been coming on for a while,\u201d said Percy, mopping his eyes under his glasses \nwith a corner of his traveling cloak. \u201cBut I had to find a way out and it's not so easy at \nthe Ministry, they're imprisoning traitors all the time. I managed to make contact with \nAberforth and he tipped me off ten minutes ago that Hogwarts was going to make a fight \nof it, so here I am.\u201d \n\n \u201cWell, we do look to our prefects to take a lead at times such as these,\u201d said \nGeorge in a good imitation of Percy's most pompous manner. \u201cNow let's get upstairs and \nfight, or all the good Death Eaters'll be taken.\u201d \n\n \u201cSo, you're my sister in-law now?\u201d Said Percy, shaking hands with Fleur as they \nhurried off toward the staircase with Bill, Fred, and George. \n\n \u201cGinny!\u201d barked Mrs. Weasley. \n\n Ginny had been attempting, under cover of the reconciliations to sneak upstairs \ntoo. \n\n\f\n \u201cMolly, how about this,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cWhy doesn't Ginny stay here , then at least \nshe'll be on the scene and know what's going on, but she won't be in the middle of the \nfighting?\u201d \n\n \u201cI---\u201d \n\n \u201cThat's a good idea,\u201d said Mr. Weasley firmly, \u201c Ginny, you stay in this room, \nyou hear me?\u201d \n\n Ginny did not seem to like the idea much, but under her father's unusually stern \ngaze, she nodded. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Lupin headed off to the stairs as well. \n\n \u201cWhere's Ron?\u201d asked Harry, \u201cWhere's Hermione?\u201d \n\n \u201cThey must have gone up the Great Hall already,\u201d Mr. Weasley called over his \nshoulder. \n\n \u201c I didn't see them pass me,\u201d said Harry. \n\n \u201cThey said something about a bathroom,\u201d said Ginny, \u201cnot long after you left.\u201d \n\n \u201cA bathroom?\u201d \n\n Harry strode across the room to an open door leading off the Room of \nRequirement and checked the bathroom beyond. It was empty. \n\n \u201cYou're sure they said bath---?\u201d \n\n But then his scar seared and the Room of Req1uirement vanished. He was \nlooking through the high wrought-iron gates with winged boats on pillars at either side, \nlooking through the dark grounds toward the castle, which was ablaze with lights. Nagini \nlay draped over his shoulders. He was possessed of that cold, cruel sense of purpose that \npreceded murder. \n\n \n\nChapter Thirty-One \n\nThe Battle of Hogwarts \n\n \n\nThe enchanted ceiling of the Great Hall was dark and scattered with stars, and \nbelow it the four long House tables were lined with disheveled students, some in \ntraveling cloaks, others in dressing gowns. Here and there shone the pearly white figures \nof the school ghosts. Every eye, living and dead was fixed upon Professor McGonagall, \nwho was speaking from the raised platform at the top of the Hall. Behind her stood the \nremaining teaches, including the palomino centaur, Firenze, and the members of the \nOrder of the Phoenix who had arrived to fight. \n\n \n\n \"...evacuation will be overseen by Mr. Filch and Madame Pomfrey. Prefects, \nwhen I give the word, you will organize your House and take your charges in orderly \nfashion to the evacuation point. \n\n \n\n Many of the students looked petrified. However, as Harry skirted the walls, \nscanning the Gryffindor table for Ron and Hermione, Ernie Macmillan stood up at the \nHufflepuff table and shouted; \"And what if we want to stay and fight?\" \n\n \n\n There was a smattering of applause. \n\n \n\n\f\n \"If you are of age, you may stay.\" said Professor McGonagall. \n\n \n\n \"What about our things?\" called a girl at the Ravenclaw table. \"Our trunks, our \nowls?\" \n\n \n\n \"We have no time to collect possessions.\" said Professor McGonagall. \"The \nimportant thing is to get you out of here safely.\" \n\n \n\n \"Where's Professor Snape?\" shouted a girl from the Slytherin table. \n\n \n\n \"He has, to use the common phrase, done a bunk.\" replied Professor McGonagall \nand a great cheer erupted from the Gryffindors, Hufflepuffs, and Ravenclaws. \n\n \n\n Harry moved up the Hall alongside the Gryffindor table, still looking for Ron and \nHermione. As he passed, faces turned in his direction, and a great deal of whispering \nbroke out in his wake. \n\n \n\n \"We have already placed protection around the castle,\" Professor McGonagall \nwas saying, \"but it is unlikely to hold for very long unless we reinforce it. I must ask you, \ntherefore, to move quickly and calmly, and do as your prefects -\" \n\n \n\n But her final words were drowned as a different voice echoed throughout the Hall. \nIt was high, cold, and clear. There was no telling from where it came. It seemed to issue \nfrom the walls themselves. Like the monster it had once commanded, it might have lain \ndormant there for centuries. \n\n \n\n \"I know that you are preparing to fight.\" There were screams amongst the \nstudents, some of whom clutched each other, looking around in terror for the source of \nthe sound. \"Your efforts are futile. You cannot fight me. I do not want to kill you. I \nhave great respect for the teachers of Hogwarts. I do not want to spill magical blood.\" \n\n \n\n There was silence in the Hall now, the kind of silence that presses against the \neardrums, that seems too huge to be contained by walls. \n\n \n\n \"Give me Harry Potter,\" said Voldemort's voice, \"and they shall not be harmed. \nGive me Harry Potter and I shall leave the school untouched. Give me Harry Potter and \nyou will be rewarded. \n\n \n\n \"You have until midnight.\" \n\n \n\n The silence swallowed them all again. Every head turned, every eye in the place \nseemed to have found Harry, to hold him forever in the glare of thousands of invisible \nbeams. Then a figure rose from the Slytherin table and he recognized Pansy Parkinson as \nshe raised a shaking arm and screamed, \"But he's there! Potter's there. Someone grab \nhim!\" \n\n \n\n\f\n Before Harry could speak, there was a massive movement. The Gryffindors in \nfront of him had risen and stood facing, not Harry, but the Slytherins. Then the \nHufflepuffs stood, and almost at the same moment, the Ravenclaws, all of them with their \nbacks to Harry, all of them looking toward Pansy instead, and Harry, awestruck and \noverwhelmed, saw wands emerging everywhere, pulled from beneath cloaks and from \nunder sleeves. \n\n \n\n \"Thank you, Miss Parkinson.\" said Professor McGonagall in a clipped voice. \n\"You will leave the Hall first with Mr. Filch. If the rest of your House could follow.\" \n\n \n\n Harry heard the grinding of the benches and then the sound of the Slytherins \ntrooping out on the other side of the Hall. \n\n \n\n \"Ravenclaws, follow on!\" cried Professor McGonagall. \n\n \n\n Slowly the four tables emptied. The Slytherin table was completely deserted, but \na number of older Ravenclaws remained seated while their fellows filed out; even more \nHufflepuffs stayed behind, and half of Gryffindor remained in their seats, necessitating \nProfessor McGonagall's descent from the teachers' platform to chivvy the underage on \ntheir way. \n\n \n\n \"Absolutely not, Creevey, go! And you, Peakes!\" \n\n \n\n Harry hurried over to the Weasleys, all sitting together at the Gryffindor table. \n\n \n\n \"Where are Ron and Hermione?\" \n\n \n\n \"Haven't you found -?\" began Mr. Weasley, looking worried. \n\n \n\n But he broke off as Kingsley had stepped forward on the raised platform to \naddress those who had remained behind. \n\n \n\n \"We've only got half an half an hour until midnight, so we need to act fast. A \nbattle plan has been agreed between the teachers of Hogwarts and the Order of the \nPhoenix. Professors Flitwick, Sprout and McGonagall are going to take groups of \nfighters up to the three highest towers - Ravenclaw, Astronomy, and Gryffindor - where \nthey'll have good overview, excellent positions from which to work spells. Meanwhile \nRemus\" - he indicated Lupin - \"Arthur\" - he pointed toward Mr. Weasley, sitting at the \nGryffindor table - \"and I will take groups into the grounds. We'll need somebody to \norganize defense of the entrances or the passageways into the school -\" \n\n \n\n \"Sounds like a job for us.\" called Fred, indicating himself and George, and \nKingsley nodded his approval. \n\n \n\n \"All right, leaders up here and we'll divide up the troops!\" \n\n \n\n\f\n \"Potter,\" said Professor McGonagall, hurrying up to him, as students flooded the \nplatform, jostling for position, receiving instructions, \"Aren't you supposed to be looking \nfor something?\" \n\n \n\n \"What? Oh,\" said Harry, \"oh yeah!\" \n\n \n\n He had almost forgotten about the Horcrux, almost forgotten that the battle was \nbeing fought so that he could search for it: The inexplicable absence of Ron and \nHermione had momentarily driven every other thought from his mind. \n\n \n\n \"Then go, Potter, go!\" \n\n \n\n \"Right - yeah -\" \n\n \n\n He sensed eyes following him as he ran out of the Great Hall again, into the \nentrance hall still crowded with evacuating students. He allowed himself to be swept up \nthe marble staircase with them, but at the top he hurried off along a deserted corridor. \nFear and panic were clouding his thought processes. He tried to calm himself, to \nconcentrate on finding the Horcrux, but his thoughts buzzed as frantically and fruitlessly \nas wasps trapped beneath a glass. Without Ron and Hermione to help him he could not \nseem to marshal his ideas. He slowed down, coming to a halt halfway along a passage, \nwhere he sat down on the plinth of a departed statue and pulled the Marauder's Map out \nof the pouch around his neck. He could not see Ron's of Hermione's names anywhere on \nit, though the density of the crowd of dots now making its way to the Room of \nRequirement might, he thought, be concealing them. He put the map away, pressed his \nhands over his face, and closed his eyes, trying to concentrate. \n\n \n\n Voldemort thought I'd go to Ravenclaw Tower. \n\n \n\n There it was, a solid fact, the place to start. Voldemort had stationed Alecto \nCarrow in the Ravenclaw common room, and there could be only one explanation; \nVoldemort feared that Harry already knew his Horcrux was connected to that House. \n\n \n\n But the only object anyone seemed to associate with Ravenclaw was the lost \ndiadem... and how could the Horcrux be the diadem? How was it possible that \nVoldemort, the Slytherin, had found the diadem that had eluded generations of \nRavenclaws? Who could have told him where to look, when nobody had seen the diadem \nin living memory? \n\n \n\n In living memory... \n\n \n\n Beneath his fingers, Harry's eyes flew open again. He leapt up from the plinth \nand tore back the way he had come, now in pursuit of his one last hope. The sound of \nhundreds of people marching toward the Room of Requirement grew louder and louder \nas he returned to the marble stairs. Prefects were shouting instructions, trying to keep \ntrack of the students in their own houses, there was much pushing and shouting; Harry \n\n\f\nsaw Zacharias Smith bowling over first years to get to the front of the queue, here and \nthere younger students were in tears, while older ones called desperately for friends or \nsiblings. \n\n \n\n Harry caught sight of a pearly white figure drifting across the entrance hall below \nand yelled as loudly as he could over the clamor. \n\n \n\n \"Nick! NICK! I need to talk to you!\" \n\n \n\n He forced his way back through the tide of students, finally reaching the bottom \nof the stairs, where Nearly Headless Nick, ghost of Gryffindor Tower, stood waiting for \nhim. \n\n \n\n \"Harry! My dear boy!\" \n\n \n\n Nick made to grasp Harry's hands with both of his own; Harry felt as though they \nhad been thrust into icy water. \n\n \n\n \"Nick, you've got to help me. Who's the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?\" \n\n \n\n Nearly Headless Nick looked surprised and a little offended. \n\n \n\n \"The Gray Lady, of course; but if it is ghostly services you require -?\" \n\n \n\n \"It's got to be her - d'you know where she is?\" \n\n \n\n \"Let's see...\" \n\n \n\n Nick's head wobbled a little on his ruff as he turned hither and thither, peering \nover the heads of the swarming students. \n\n \n\n \"That's her over there, Harry, the young woman with the long hair.\" \n\n \n\n Harry looked in the direction of Nick's transparent, pointing finger and saw a tall \nghost who caught sight of Harry looking at her, raised her eyebrows, and drifted away \nthrough a solid wall. \n\n \n\n Harry ran after her. Once through the door of the corridor into which she had \ndisappeared, he saw her at the very end of the passage, still gliding smoothly away from \nhim. \n\n \n\n \"hey - wait - come back!\" \n\n \n\n She consented to pause, floating a few inches from the ground. Harry supposed \nthat she was beautiful, with her waist-length hair and floor-length cloak, but she also \n\n\f\nlooked haughty and proud. Close in, he recognized her as a ghost he had passed several \ntimes in the corridor, but to whom he had never spoken. \n\n \n\n \"You're the Gray Lady?\" \n\n \n\n She nodded but did not speak. \n\n \n\n \"The ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?\" \n\n \n\n \"That is correct.\" \n\n \n\n Her tone was not encouraging. \n\n \n\n \"Please, I need some help. I need to know anything you can tell me about the lost \ndiadem.\" \n\n \n\n A cold smile curved her lips. \n\n \n\n \"I am afraid,\" she said, turning to leave, \"that I cannot help you.\" \n\n \n\n \"WAIT!\" \n\n \n\n He had not meant to shout, but anger and panic were threatening to overwhelm \nhim. He glanced at his watch as she hovered in front of him. It was a quarter to midnight. \n\n \n\n \"This is urgent.\" he said fiercely. \"If that diadem's at Hogwarts, I've got to find it, \nfast.\" \n\n \n\n \"You are hardly the first student to covet the diadem.\" she said disdainfully. \n\"Generations of students have badgered me -\" \n\n \n\n \"This isn't about trying to get better marks!\" Harry shouted at her, \"It's about \nVoldemort - defeating Voldemort - or aren't you interested in that?\" \n\n \n\n She could not blush, but her transparent cheeks became more opaque, and her \nvoice was heated as she replied, \"Of course I - how dare you suggest -?\" \n\n \n\n \"Well, help me then!\" \n\n \n\n Her composure was slipping. \n\n \n\n \"It - it is not a question of -\" she stammered. My mother's diadem -\" \n\n \n\n \"Your mother's?\" \n\n \n\n She looked angry with herself. \n\n\f\n \n\n \"When I lived,\" she said stiffly, \"I was Helena Ravenclaw.\" \n\n \n\n \"You're her daughter? But then, you must know what happed to it.\" \n\n \n\n \n\n \"While the diadem bestows wisdom,\" she said with an obvious effort to pull \nherself together, \"I doubt that it would greatly increase you chances of defeating the \nwizard who calls himself Lord -\" \n\n \n\n Haven't I told you, I'm not interested in wearing it!\" Harry said fiercely. \"There's \nno time to explain - but if you care about Hogwarts, if you want to see Voldemort \nfinished, you've got to tell me anything you know about the diadem!\" \n\n \n\n She remained quite still, floating in midair, staring down at him, and a sense of \nhopelessness engulfed Harry. Of course, if she had known anything, she would have told \nFlitwick of Dumbledore, who had surely asked her the same question. He had shaken his \nhead and made to turn away when she spoke in a low voice. \n\n \n\n \"I stole the diadem from my mother.\" \n\n \n\n \"You - you did what?\" \n\n \n\n \"I stole the diadem.\" repeated Helena Ravenclaw in a whisper. \"I sought to make \nmyself cleverer, more important than my mother. I ran away with it.\" \n\n \n\n He did not know how he had managed to gain her confidence and did not ask, he \nsimply listened, hard, as she went on. \n\n \n\n \"My mother, they say, never admitted that the diadem was gone, but pretended \nthat she had it still. She concealed her loss, my dreadful betrayal, even from the other \nfounders of Hogwarts. \n\n \n\n \"Then my mother fell ill - fatally ill. In spite of my perfidy, she was desperate to \nsee me one more time. She sent a man who had long loved me, though I spurned his \nadvances, to find me. She knew that he would not rest until he had done so.\" \n\n \n\n Harry waited. She drew a deep breath and threw back her head. \n\n \n\n \"He tracked me to the forest where I was hiding. When I refused to return with \nhim, he became violent. The baron was always a hot-tempered man. Furious at my \nrefusal, jealous of my freedom, he stabbed me.\" \n\n \n\n \"The Baron? You mean -?\" \n\n \n\n\f\n \"he Bloody Baron, yes,\" said the Gray Lady, and she lifted aside the cloak she \nwore to reveal a single dark wound in her white chest. When he saw what he had done, \nhe was overcome with remorse. He took the weapon that had claimed my life, and used \nit to kill himself. All these centuries later, he wears his chains as an act of penitence ... as \nhe should.\" she added bitterly. \n\n \n\n \"And - and the diadem?\" \n\n \n\n \"It remained where I had hidden it when I heard the Baron blundering through the \nforest toward me. Concealed inside a hollow tree.\" \n\n \n\n \"A hollow tree?\" repeated Harry. \"What tree? Where was this?\" \n\n \n\n \"A forest in Albania. A lonely place I thought was far beyond my mother's \nreach.\" \n\n \n\n \"Albania,\" repeated Harry. Sense was emerging miraculously from confusion, \nand now he understood why she was telling him what she had denied Dumbledore and \nFlitwick. \"You've already told someone this story, haven't you? Another student?\" \n\n \n\n She closed her eyes and nodded. \n\n \n\n \"I had... no idea... He was flattering. He seemed to... understand... to \nsympathize...\" \n\n \n\n Yes, Harry thought. Tom Riddle would certainly have understood Helena \nRavenclaw's desire to possess fabulous objects to which she had little right. \n\n \n\n \"Well, you weren't the first person Riddle wormed things out of.\" Harry muttered. \n\"He could be charming when he wanted...\" \n\n \n\n So, Voldemort had managed to wheedle the location of the lost diadem out of the \nGray Lady. He had traveled to that far-flung forest and retrieved the diadem from its \nhiding place, perhaps as soon as he left Hogwarts, before he even started work at Borgin \nand Burkes. \n\n \n\n And wouldn't those secluded Albanian woods have seemed an excellent refuge \nwhen, so much later, Voldemort and needed a place to lie low, undisturbed, for ten long \nyears? \n\n \n\n But the diadem, once it became his precious Horcrux, had not been left in that \nlowly tree. . . . No, the diadem had been returned secretly to its true home, and Voldemort \nmust have put it there \u2013 \n\n \u201c\u2014the night he asked for a job!\u201d said Harry, finishing his thought. \n\n \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d \n\n\f\n \u201cHe hid the diadem in the castle, the night he asked Dumbledore to let him \nteach!\u201d said Harry. Saying it out loud enabled him to make sense of it all. \u201cHe must\u2019ve \nhidden the diadem on his way up to, or down from, Dumbledore\u2019s office! But it was well \nworth trying to get the job \u2013 then he might\u2019ve got the chance to nick Gryffindor\u2019s sword \nas well \u2013 thank you, thanks!\u201d \n\n Harry left her floating there, looking utterly bewildered. As he rounded the corner \nback into the entrance hall, he checked his watch. It was five minutes until midnight, and \nthough he now knew what the last Horcrux was, he was no closer to discovering where it \nwas. . . \n\n Generations of students had failed to find the diadem; that suggested that it was \nnot in Ravenclaw Tower \u2013 but if not there, where? What hiding place had Tom Riddle \ndiscovered inside Hogwarts Castle, that he believed would remain secret forever? \n\n Lost in desperate speculation, Harry turned a corner, but he had taken only a few \nsteps down the new corridor when the window to his left broke open with a deafening, \nshattering crash. As he leapt aside, a gigantic body flew in through the window and hit \nthe opposite wall. \n\nSomething large and furry detached itself, whimpering, from the new arrival and flung \nitself at Harry. \n\n \u201cHagrid!\u201d Harry bellowed, fighting off Fang the boarhound\u2019s attentions as the \nenormous bearded figure clambered to his feet \u201cWhat the --?\u201d \n\n \u201cHarry, yer here! Yer here!\u201d \n\n Hagrid stooped down, bestowed upon Harry a cursory and rib-cracking hug, then \nran back to the shattered window. \n\n \u201cGood boy, Grawpy!\u201d he bellowed through the hole in the window. \u201cI\u2019ll se yer in \na moment, there\u2019s a good lad!\u201d \n\n Beyond Hagrid, out in the dark night, Harry saw bursts of light in the distance and \nheard a weird, keening scream. He looked down at his watch: It was midnight. The battle \nhad begun. \n\n \u201cBlimey, Harry,\u201d panted Hagrid, \u201cthis is it, eh? Time ter fight?\u201d \n\n \u201cHagrid, where have you come from?\u201d \n\n \u201cHeard You-Know-Who from up in our cave,\u201d said Hagrid grimly. \u201cVoice carried, \ndidn\u2019t it? \u2018Yet got till midnight ter gimme Potter.\u2019 Knew yeh mus\u2019 be here, knew that \nmus\u2019 be happenin\u2019. Get down, Fang. So we come ter join in, me an\u2019 Grawpy an\u2019 Fang. \nSmashed our way through the boundary by the forest, Grawpy was carryin\u2019 us, Fang an\u2019 \nme. Told him ter let me down at the castle, so he shoved me through the window, bless \nhim. Not exactly what I meant, bu\u2019 \u2013 where\u2019s Ron an\u2019 Hermione?\u201d \n\n \u201cThat,\u201d said Harry, \u201cis a really good question. Come on.\u201d \n\n They hurried together along the corridor, Fang lolloping beside them. Harry could \nhear movement through the corridors all around: running footsteps, shouts; through the \nwindows, he could see more flashes of light in the dark grounds. \n\n \u201cWhere\u2019re we goin\u2019?\u201d puffed Hagrid, pounding along at Harry\u2019s heels, making \nthe floorboards quake. \n\n \u201cI dunno exactly,\u201d said Harry, making another random turn, \u201cbut Ron and \nHermione must be around here somewhere. . . .\u201d \n\n The first casualties of the battle were already strewn across the passage ahead: \nThe two stone gargoyles that usually guarded the entrance to the staffroom had been \n\n\f\nsmashed apart by a jinx that had sailed through another broken window. Their remains \nstirred feebly on the floor, and as Harry leapt over one of their disembodied heads, it \nmoaned faintly. \u201cOh, don\u2019t mind me . . . I\u2019ll just be here and crumble. . . .\u201d \n\n Its ugly stone face made Harry think suddenly of the marble bust of Rowena \nRavenclaw at Xenophilius\u2019s house, wearing that mad headdress \u2013 and then of the statue \nin Ravenclaw Tower, with the stone diadem upon her white curls. . . . \n\n And as he reached the end of the passage, the memory of a third stone effigy \ncame back to him: that of an ugly old warlock, onto whose head Harry himself had \nplaced a wig and a battered old hat. The shock shot through Harry with the heat of \nfirewhisky, and he nearly stumbled. \n\n He knew, at least, where the Horcrux sat waiting for him. . . . \n\n Tom Riddle, who confided in no one and operated alone, might have been \narrogant enough to assume that he, and only he, had penetrated the deepest mysteries of \nHogwarts Castle. Of course, Dumbledore and Flitwick, those model pupils, had never set \nfoot in that particular place, but he, Harry, had strayed off the beaten track in his time at \nschool \u2013 here at least was a secret area he and Voldemort knew, that Dumbledore had \nnever discovered \u2013 \n\n He was roused by Professor Sprout, who was thundering past followed by Neville \nand half a dozen others, all of them wearing earmuffs and carrying what appeared to be \nlarge potted plants. \n\n \u201cMandrakes!\u201d Neville bellowed at Harry over his shoulder as he ran. \u201cGoing to \nlob them over the walls \u2013 they won\u2019t like this!\u201d \n\n Harry knew now where to go. He sped off, with Hagrid and Fang galloping \nbehind him. They passed portrait after portrait, and the painted figures raced alongside \nthem, wizards and witches in ruffs and breeches, in armor and cloaks, cramming \nthemselves into each others\u2019 canvases, screaming news from other parts of the castle. As \nthey reached the end of this corridor, the whole castle shook, and Harry knew, as a \ngigantic vase blew off its plinth with explosive force, that it was in the grip of \nenchantments more sinister than those of the teachers and the Order. \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s all righ\u2019, Fang \u2013 it\u2019s all righ\u2019!\u201d yelled Hagrid, but the great boarhound had \ntaken flight as slivers of china flew like shrapnel through the air, and Hagrid pounded off \nafter the terrified dog, leaving Harry alone. \n\n He forged on through the trembling passages, his wand at the ready, and for the \nlength of one corridor the little painted knight, Sir Cadrigan, rushed from painting to \npainting beside him, clanking along in his armor, screaming encouragement, his fat little \npony cantering behind him. \n\n \u201cBraggarts and rogues, dogs and scoundrels, drive them out, Harry Potter, see \nthem off!\u201d \n\n Harry hurtled around a corner and found Fred and a small knot of students, \nincluding Lee Jordan and Hannah Abbott, standing beside another empty plinth, whose \nstatue had concealed a secret passageway. Their wands were drawn and they were \nlistening at the concealed hole. \n\n \u201cNice night for it!\u201d Fred shouted as the castle quaked again, and Harry sprinted by, \nelated and terrified in equal measure. Along yet another corridor he dashed, and then \nthere were owls everywhere, and Mrs. Norris was hissing and trying to bat them with her \npaws, no doubt to return them to their proper place. . . . \n\n\f\n \u201cPotter!\u201d \n\n Aberforth Dumbledore stood blocking the corridor ahead, his wand held ready. \n\n \u201cI\u2019ve had hundreds of kids thundering through my pub, Potter!\u201d \n\u201cI know, we\u2019re evacuating,\u201d Harry said, \u201cVoldemort\u2019s \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201c\u2013 attacking because they haven\u2019t handed you over, yeah,\u201d said Aberforth. \u201cI\u2019m \nnot deaf, the whole of Hogsmeade heard him. And it never occurred to any of you to keep \na few Slytherins hostage? There are kids of Death Eaters you\u2019ve just sent to safety. \nWouldn\u2019t it have been a bit smarter to keep \u2018em here?\u201d \n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t stop Voldemort,\u201d said Harry, \u201cand your brother would never have \ndone it.\u201d \nAberforth grunted and tore away in the opposite direction. \n\n Your brother would never have done it. . . . Well, it was the truth, Harry thought \nas he ran on again: Dumbledore, who had defended Snape for so long, would never have \nheld students ransom. . . . \n\n And then he skidded around a final corner and with a yell of mingled relief and \nfury he saw them: Ron and Hermione; both with their arms full of large, curved, dirty \nyellow objects, Ron with a broomstick under his arms. \n\n \u201cWhere the hell have you been?\u201d Harry shouted. \n\n \u201cChamber of Secrets,\u201d said Ron. \n\n \u201cChamber \u2013 what?\u201d said Harry, coming to an unsteady halt before them. \n\n \u201cIt was Ron, all Ron\u2019s idea!\u201d said Hermione breathlessly. \u201cWasn\u2019t it absolutely \nbrilliant? There we were, after we left, and I said to Ron, even if we find the other one, \nhow are we going to get rid of it? We still hadn\u2019t got rid of the cup! And then he thought \nof it! The basilisk!\u201d \n\n \u201cWhat the \u2013 ?\u201d \n\n \u201cSomething to get rid of Horcruxes,\u201d said Ron simply. \n\n Harry\u2019s eyes dropped to the objects clutched in Ron and Hermione\u2019s arms: great \ncurved fangs; torn, he now realized, from the skull of a dead basilisk. \n\n \u201cBut how did you get in there?\u201d he asked, staring from the fangs to Ron. \u201cYou \nneed to speak Parseltongue!\u201d \n\u201cHe did!\u201d whispered Hermione. \u201cShow him, Ron!\u201d \nRon made a horrible strangled hissing noise. \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s what you did to open the locket,\u201d he told Harry apologetically. \u201cI had to have \na few goes to get it right, but,\u201d he shrugged modestly, \u201cwe got there in the end.\u201d \n\u201cHe was amazing!\u201d said Hermione. \u201cAmazing!\u201d \n\n \u201cSo . . .\u201d Harry was struggling to keep up. \u201cSo . . .\u201d \n\n \u201cSo we\u2019re another Horcrux down,\u201d said Ron, and from under his jacket he pulled \nthe mangled remains of Hufflepuff\u2019s cup. \u201cHermione stabbed it. Thought she should. She \nhasn\u2019t had the pleasure yet.\u201d \n\u201cGenius!\u201d yelled Harry. \n\n \u201cIt was nothing,\u201d said Ron, though he looked delighted with himself. \u201cSo what\u2019s \nnew with you?\u201d \n\n As he said it, there was an explosion from overhead: All three of them looked up \nas dust fell from the ceiling and they heard a distant scream. \n\n \u201cI know what the diadem looks like, and I know where it is,\u201d said Harry, talking \nfast. \u201cHe hid it exactly where I had my old Potions book, where everyone\u2019s been hiding \n\n\f\nstuff for centuries. He thought he was the only one to find it. Come on.\u201d \nAs the walls trembled again, he led the other two back through the concealed \nentrance and down the staircase into the Room of Requirement. It was empty except for \nthree women: Ginny, Tonks and an elderly witch wearing a moth-eaten hat, whom Harry \nrecognized immediately as Neville\u2019s grandmother. \n\n \u201cAh, Potter,\u201d she said crisply as if she had been waiting for him. \u201cYou can tell us \nwhat\u2019s going on.\u201d \n\u201cIs everyone okay?\u201d said Ginny and Tonks together. \n\n \u201c\u2019S far as we know,\u201d said Harry. \u201cAre there still people in the passage to the \nHog\u2019s Head?\u201d \n\n He knew that the room would not be able to transform while there were still users \ninside it. \n\n \u201cI was the last to come through,\u201d said Mrs. Longbottom. \u201cI sealed it, I think it \nunwise to leave it open now Aberforth has left his pub. Have you seen my grandson?\u201d \n\n \u201cHe\u2019s fighting,\u201d said Harry. \n\n \u201cNaturally,\u201d said the old lady proudly. \u201cExcuse me, I must go and assist him.\u201d \nWith surprising speed she trotted off toward the stone steps. \n\n Harry looked at Tonks. \n\n \u201cI thought you were supposed to be with Teddy at your mother\u2019s?\u201d \n\u201cI couldn\u2019t stand not knowing \u2013\u201c Tonks looked anguished. \u201cShe\u2019ll look after him \n\u2013 have you seen Remus?\u201d \n\u201cHe was planning to lead a group of fighters into the grounds \u2013\u201c \n\n Without another word, Tonks sped off. \n\n \u201cGinny,\u201d said Harry, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but we need you to leave too. Just for a bit. Then \nyou can come back in.\u201d \n\n Ginny looked simply delighted to leave her sanctuary. \n\n \u201cAnd then you can come back in!\u201d he shouted after her as she ran up the steps \nafter Tonks. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to come back in!\u201d \n\n \u201cHang on a moment!\u201d said Ron sharply. \u201cWe\u2019ve forgotten someone!\u201d \n\u201cWho?\u201d asked Hermione. \n\n \u201cThe house-elves, they\u2019ll all be down in the kitchen, won\u2019t they?\u201d \n\u201cYou mean we ought to get them fighting?\u201d asked Harry. \n\n \u201cNo,\u201d said Ron seriously, \u201cI mean we should tell them to get out. We don\u2019t want \nanymore Dobbies, do we? We can\u2019t order them to die for us \u2013\u201c \n\n There was a clatter as the basilisk fangs cascaded out of Hermione\u2019s arms. \nRunning at Ron, she flung them around his neck and kissed him full on the mouth. Ron \nthrew away the fangs and broomstick he was holding and responded with such \nenthusiasm that he lifted Hermione off her feet. \n\n \u201cIs this the moment?\u201d Harry asked weakly, and when nothing happened except \nthat Ron and Hermione gripped each other still more firmly and swayed on the spot, he \nraised his voice. \u201cOi! There\u2019s a war going on here!\u201d \nRon and Hermione broke apart, their arms still around each other. \n\n \u201cI know, mate,\u201d said Ron, who looked as though he had recently been hit on the \nback of the head with a Bludger, \u201cso it\u2019s now or never, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \n\n \u201cNever mind that, what about the Horcrux?\u201d Harry shouted. \u201cD\u2019you think you \ncould just \u2013 just hold it in until we\u2019ve got the diadem?\u201d \n\n\f\n \u201cYeah \u2013 right \u2013 sorry \u2013\u201c said Ron, and he and Hermione set about gathering up \nfangs, both pink in the face. \n\n It was clear, as the three of them stepped back into the corridor upstairs, that in \nthe minutes that they had spent in the Room of Requirement the situation within the \ncastle had deteriorated severely: The walls and ceiling were shaking worse than ever; \ndust filled the air, and through the nearest window, Harry saw bursts of green and red \nlight so close to the foot of the castle that he knew the Death Eaters must be very near to \nentering the place. Looking down, Harry saw Grawp the giant meandering past, swinging \nwhat looked like a stone gargoyle torn from the roof and roaring his displeasure. \n\n \u201cLet\u2019s hope he steps on some of them!\u201d said Ron as more screams echoed from \nclose by. \n\n \u201cAs long as it\u2019s not any of our lot!\u201d said a voice: Harry turned and saw Ginny and \nTonks, both with their wands drawn at the next window, which was missing several \npanes. Even as he watched, Ginny sent a well-aimed jinx into a crowd of fighters below. \n\n \u201cGood girl!\u201d roared a figure running through the dust toward them, and Harry saw \nAberforth again, his gray hair flying as he led a small group of students past. \u201cThey look \nlike they might be breaching the north battlements, they\u2019ve brought giants of their own.\u201d \n\n \u201cHave you seen Remus?\u201d Tonks called after him. \n\n \u201cHe was dueling Dolohov,\u201d shouted Aberforth, \u201chaven\u2019t seen him since!\u201d \n\u201cTonks,\u201d said Ginny, \u201cTonks, I\u2019m sure he\u2019s okay \u2013\u201c \n\n But Tonks had run off into the dust after Aberforth. \n\n Ginny turned, helpless, to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. \n\n \u201cThey\u2019ll be all right,\u201d said Harry, though he knew they were empty words. \n\u201cGinny, we\u2019ll be back in a moment, just keep out of the way, keep safe \u2013 come on!\u201d he \nsaid to Ron and Hermione, and they ran back to the stretch of wall beyond which the \nRoom of Requirement was waiting to do the bidding of the next entrant. \n\n I need the place where everything is hidden. Harry begged of it inside his head, \nand the door materialized on their third run past. \n\n The furor of the battle died the moment they crossed the threshold and closed the \ndoor behind them: All was silent. They were in a place the size of a cathedral with the \nappearance of a city, its towering walls built of objects hidden by thousands of long-gone \nstudents. \n\n \u201cAnd he never realized anyone could get in?\u201d said Ron, his voice echoing in the \nsilence. \n\n \u201cHe thought he was the only one,\u201d said Harry. \u201cToo bad for him I\u2019ve had to hide \nstuff in my time . . . this way,\u201d he added. \u201cI think it\u2019s down here. . . .\u201d \nThey sped off up adjacent aisles; Harry could hear the others\u2019 footsteps echoing \nthrough the towering piles of junk, of bottles, hats, crates, chairs, books, weapons, \nbroomsticks, bats. . . . \n\n \u201cSomewhere near here,\u201d Harry muttered to himself. \u201cSomewhere . . . \nsomewhere . . .\u201d \n\n Deeper and deeper into the labyrinth he went, looking for objects he recognized \nfrom his one previous trip into the room. His breath was loud in his ears, and then his \nvery soul seemed to shiver. There it was, right ahead, the blistered old cupboard in which \nhe had hidden his old Potions book, and on top of it, the pockmarked stone warlock \nwearing a dusty old wig and what looked like an ancient discolored tiara. \n\n\f\n He had already stretched out his hand, though he remained few feet away, when a \nvoice behind him said, \u201cHold it, Potter.\u201d \n\n He skidded to a halt and turned around. Crabbe and Goyle were standing behind \nhim, shoulder to shoulder, wands pointing right at Harry. Through the small space \nbetween their jeering faces he saw Draco Malfoy. \n\n \u201cThat\u2019s my wand you\u2019re holding, Potter,\u201d said Malfoy, pointing his own through \nthe gap between Crabbe and Goyle. \n\n \u201cNot anymore,\u201d panted Harry, tightening his grip on the hawthorn wand. \n\u201cWinners, keepers, Malfoy. Who\u2019s lent you theirs?\u201d \n\n \u201cMy mother,\u201d said Draco. \n\n Harry laughed, though there was nothing very humorous about the situation. He \ncould not hear Ron or Hermione anymore. They seemed to have run out of earshot, \nsearching for the diadem. \n\n \u201cSo how come you three aren\u2019t with Voldemort?\u201d asked Harry. \n\n \u201cWe\u2019re gonna be rewarded,\u201d said Crabbe. His voice was surprisingly soft for such \nan enormous person: Harry had hardly ever heard him speak before. Crabbe was speaking \nlike a small child promised a large bag of sweets. \u201cWe \u2018ung back, Potter. We decided not \nto go. Decided to bring you to \u2018im.\u201d \n\n \u201cGood plan,\u201d said Harry in mock admiration. He could not believe that he was \nthis close, and was going to be thwarted by Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle. He began edging \nslowly backward toward the place where the Horcrux sat lopsided upon the bust. If he \ncould just get his hands on it before the fight broke out . . . \n\n \u201cSo how did you get in here?\u201d he asked, trying to distract them. \n\n\u201cI virtually lived in the Room of Hidden Things all last year,\u201d said Malfoy, his \nvoice brittle. \u201cI know how to get in.\u201d \n\n\u201cWe was hiding in the corridor outside,\u201d grunted Goyle. \u201cWe can do Diss-lusion \nCharms now! And then,\u201d his face split into a gormless grin, \u201cyou turned up right in front \nof us and said you was looking for a die-dum! What\u2019s a die-dum?\u201d \n\n\u201cHarry?\u201d Ron\u2019s voice echoed suddenly from the other side of the wall to Harry\u2019s \nright. \u201cAre you talking to someone?\u201d \n\nWith a whiplike movement, Crabbe pointed his wand at the fifty foot mountain of \nold furniture, of broken trunks, of old books and robes and unidentifiable junk, and \nshouted, \u201cDescendo!\u201d \n\nThe wall began to totter, then the top third crumbled into the aisle next door \nwhere Ron stood. \n\n\u201cRon!\u201d Harry bellowed, as somewhere out of sight Hermione screamed, and \nHarry heard innumerable objects crashing to the floor on the other side of the destabilized \nwall: He pointed his wand at the rampart, cried, \u201cFinite!\u201d and it steadied. \n\n\u201cNo!\u201d shouted Malfoy, staying Crabbe\u2019s arm as the latter made to repeat his spell. \n\u201cIf you wreck the room you might bury this diadem thing!\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that matter?\u201d said Crabbe, tugging himself free. \u201cIt\u2019s Potter the Dark \nLord wants, who cares about a die-dum?\u201d \n\n\u201cPotter came in here to get it,\u201d said Malfoy with ill-disguised impatience at the \nslow-wittedness of his colleagues. \u201cso that must mean \u2013\u201c \n\n\u201c\u2019Must mean\u2019?\u201d Crabbe turned on Malfoy with undisguised ferocity. \u201cWho cares \nwhat you think? I don\u2019t take your orders no more, Draco. You an\u2019 your dad are finished.\u201d \n\n\f\n\u201cHarry?\u201d shouted Ron again, from the other side of the junk wad. \u201cWhat\u2019s going \non?\u201d \n\n\u201cHarry?\u201d mimicked Crabbe. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on \u2013 no, Potter! Crucio!\u201d \n\nHarry had lunged for the tiara; Crabbe\u2019s curse missed him but hit the stone bust, \nwhich flew into the air; the diadem soared upward and then dropped out of sight in the \nmass of objects on which the bust had rested. \n\n\u201cSTOP!\u201d Malfoy shouted at Crabbe, his voice echoing through the enormous \nroom. \u201cThe Dark Lord wants him alive \u2013\u201c \n\n\u201cSo? I\u2019m not killing him, am I?\u201d yelled Crabbe, throwing off Malfoy\u2019s restraining \narm. \u201cBut if I can, I will, the Dark Lord wants him dead anyway, what\u2019s the diff \u2013 ?\u201d \n\nA jet of scarlet light shot past Harry by inches: Hermione had run around the \ncorner behind him and sent a Stunning Spell straight at Crabbe\u2019s head. It only missed \nbecause Malfoy pulled him out of the way. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s that Mudblood! Avada Kedavra!\u201d \n\nHarry saw Hermione dive aside, and his fury that Crabbe had aimed to kill wiped \nall else from his mind. He shot a Stunning Spell at Crabbe, who lurched out of the way, \nknocking Malfoy\u2019s wand out of his hand; it rolled out of sight beneath a mountain of \nbroken furniture and bones. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t kill him! DON\u2019T KILL HIM!\u201d Malfoy yelled at Crabbe and Goyle, who \nwere both aiming at Harry: Their split second\u2019s hesitation was all Harry needed. \n\n\u201cExpelliarmus!\u201d \n\nGoyle\u2019s wand flew out of his hand and disappeared into the bulwark of objects \nbeside him; Goyle leapt foolishly on the spot, trying to retrieve it; Malfoy jumped out of \nrange of Hermione\u2019s second Stunning Spell, and Ron, appearing suddenly at the end of \nthe aisle, shot a full Body-Bind Curse at Crabbe, which narrowly missed. \n\nCrabbe wheeled around and screamed, \u201cAvada Kedavra!\u201d again. Ron leapt out of \nsight to avoid the jet of green light. The wand-less Malfoy cowered behind a three-legged \nwardrobe as Hermione charged toward them, hitting Goyle with a Stunning Spell as she \ncame. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s somewhere here!\u201d Harry yelled at her, pointing at the pile of junk into which \nthe old tiara had fallen. \u201cLook for it while I go and help R \u2013\u201c \n\n\u201cHARRY!\u201d she screamed. \n\nA roaring, billowing noise behind him gave him a moment\u2019s warning. He turned \nand saw both Ron and Crabbe running as hard as they could up the aisle toward them. \n\n\u201cLike it hot, scum?\u201d roared Crabbe as he ran. \n\nBut he seemed to have no control over what he had done. Flames of abnormal size \nwere pursuing them, licking up the sides of the junk bulwarks, which were crumbling to \nsoot at their touch. \n\n\u201cAguamenti!\u201d Harry bawled, but the jet of water that soared from the tip of his \nwand evaporated in the air. \n\n\u201cRUN!\u201d \n\nMalfoy grabbed the Stunned Goyle and dragged him along; Crabbe outstripped all \nof them, now looking terrified; Harry, Ron, and Hermione pelted along in his wake, and \nthe fire pursued them. It was not normal fire; Crabbe had used a curse of which Harry had \nno knowledge. As they turned a corner the flames chased them as though they were alive, \nsentient, intent upon killing them. Now the fire was mutating, forming a gigantic pack of \n\n\f\nfiery beasts: Flaming serpents, chimaeras, and dragons rose and fell and rose again, and \nthe detritus of centuries on which they were feeding was thrown up into the air into their \nfanged mouths, tossed high on clawed feet, before being consumed by the inferno. \n\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had vanished from view: Harry, Ron and Hermione \nstopped dead; the fiery monsters were circling them, drawing closer and closer, claws and \nhorns and tails lashed, and the heat was solid as a wall around them. \n\n\u201cWhat can we do?\u201d Hermione screamed over the deafening roars of the fire. \n\u201cWhat can we do?\u201d \n\n\u201cHere!\u201d \n\nHarry seized a pair of heavy-looking broomsticks from the nearest pile of junk \nand threw one to Ron, who pulled Hermione onto it behind him. Harry swung his leg \nover the second broom and, with hard kicks to the ground, they soared up in the air, \nmissing by feet the horned beak of a flaming raptor that snapped its jaws at them. The \nsmoke and heat were becoming overwhelming: Below them the cursed fire was \nconsuming the contraband of generations of hunted students, the guilty outcomes of a \nthousand banned experiments, the secrets of the countless souls who had sought refuge in \nthe room. Harry couldnot see a trace of Malfoy, Crabbe, or Goyle anywhere. He swooped \nas low as he dare over the marauding monsters of flame to try to find them, but there was \nnothing but fire: What a terrible way to die. . . . He had never wanted this. . . . \n\n\u201cHarry, let\u2019s get out, let\u2019s get out!\u201d bellowed Ron, though it was impossible to see \nwhere the door was through the black smoke. \n\nAnd then Harry heard a thin, piteous human scream from amidst the terrible \ncommotion, the thunder of devouring flame. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2013 too \u2013 dangerous \u2013 !\u201d Ron yelled, but Harry wheeled in the air. His glasses \ngiving his eyes some small protection from the smoke, he raked the firestorm below, \nseeking a sign of life, a limb or a face that was not yet charred like wood. . . . \n\nAnd he saw them: Malfoy with his arms around the unconscious Goyle, the pair \nof them perched on a fragile tower of charred desks, and Harry dived. Malfoy saw him \ncoming and raised one arm, but even as Harry grasped it he knew at once that it was no \ngood. Goyle was too heavy and Malfoy\u2019s hand, covered in sweat, slid instantly out of \nHarry\u2019s \u2013 \n\n\u201cIF WE DIE FOR THEM, I\u2019LL KILL YOU, HARRY!\u201d roared Ron\u2019s voice, and, \nas a great flaming chimaera bore down upon them, he and Hermione dragged Goyle onto \ntheir broom and rose, rolling and pitching, into the air once more as Malfoy clambered up \nbehind Harry. \n\n\u201cThe door, get to the door, the door!\u201d screamed Malfoy in Harry\u2019s ear, and Harry \nsped up, following Ron, Hermione, and Goyle through the billowing black smoke, hardly \nable to breathe: and all around them the last few objects unburned by the devouring \nflames were flung into the air, as the creatures of the cursed fire cast them high in \ncelebration: cups and shields, a sparkling necklace, and an old, discolored tiara \u2013 \n\n\u201cWhat are you doing, what are you doing, the door\u2019s that way!\u201d screamed Malfoy, \nbut Harry made a hairpin swerve and dived. The diadem seemed to fall in slow motion, \nturning and glittering as it dropped toward the maw of a yawning serpent, and then he \nhad it, caught it around his wrist \u2013 \n\nHarry swerved again as the serpent lunged at him; he soared upward and straight \ntoward the place where, he prayed, the door stood open; Ron, Hermione and Goyle had \n\n\f\nvanished; Malfoy was screaming and holding Harry so tightly it hurt. Then, through the \nsmoke, Harry saw a rectangular patch on the wall and steered the broom at it, and \nmoments later clean air filled his lungs and they collided with the wall in the corridor \nbeyond. \n\nMalfoy fell off the broom and lay facedown, gasping, coughing, and retching. \nHarry rolled over and sat up: The door to the Room of Requirement had vanished, and \nRon and Hermione sat panting on the floor beside Goyle, who was still unconscious. \n\n\u201cC-Crabbe,\u201d choked Malfoy as soon as he could speak. \u201cC-Crabbe . . .\u201d \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s dead,\u201d said Ron harshly. \n\nThere was silence, apart from panting and coughing. Then a number of huge \nbangs shook the castle, and a great cavalcade of transparent figures galloped past on \nhorses, their heads screaming with bloodlust under their arms. Harry staggered to his feet \nwhen the Headless Hunt had passed and looked around: The battle was still going on all \naround him. He could hear more scream than those of the retreating ghosts. Panic flared \nwithin him. \n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Ginny?\u201d he said sharply. \u201cShe was here. She was supposed to be going \nback into the Room of Requirement.\u201d \n\n\u201cBlimey, d\u2019you reckon it\u2019ll still work after that fire?\u201d asked Ron, but he too got to \nhis feet, rubbing his chest and looking left and right. \u201cShall we split up and look \u2013 ?\u201d \n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Hermione, getting to her feet too. Malfoy and Goyle remained \nslumped hopelessly on the corridor floor; neither of them had wands. \u201cLet\u2019s stick \ntogether. I say we go \u2013 Harry, what\u2019s that on your arm?\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat? Oh yeah \u2013\u201c \n\nHe pulled the diadem from his wrist and held it up. It was still hot, blackened with \nsoot, but as he looked at it closely he was just able to make out the tiny words etched \nupon it; WIT BEYOND MEASURE IS MAN\u2019S GREATEST TREASURE. \n\nA bloodlike substance, dark and tarry, seemed to be leaking from the diadem. \nSuddenly Harry felt the thing vibrate violently, then break apart in his hands, and as it did \nso, he thought he heard the faintest, most distant scream of pain, echoing not from the \ngrounds or the castle, but from the thing that had just fragmented in his fingers. \n\n\u201cIt must have been Fiendfyre!\u201d whimpered Hermione, her eyes on the broken \npiece. \n\n\u201cSorry?\u201d \n\n\u201cFiendfyre \u2013 cursed fire \u2013 it\u2019s one of the substances that destroy Horcruxes, but I \nwould never, ever have dared use it, it\u2019s so dangerous \u2013 how did Crabbe know how to \u2013 \n?\u201d \n\n\u201cMust\u2019ve learned from the Carrows,\u201d said Harry grimly. \n\n\u201cShame he wasn\u2019t concentrating when they mentioned how to stop it, really,\u201d said \nRon, whose hair, like Hermione\u2019s, was singed, and whose face was blackened. \u201cIf he \nhadn\u2019t tried to kill us all, I\u2019d be quite sorry he was dead.\u201d \n\n\u201cBut don\u2019t you realize?\u201d whispered Hermione. \u201cThis means, if we can just get the \nsnake \u2013\u201c \n\nBut she broke off as yells and shouts and the unmistakable noises of dueling filled \nthe corridor. Harry looked around and his heart seemed to fail: Death Eaters had \npenetrated Hogwarts. Fred and Percy had just backed into view, both of them dueling \nmasked and hooded men. \n\n\f\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione ran forward to help: Jets of light flew in every \ndirection and the man dueling Percy backed off, fast: Then his hood slipped and they saw \na high forehead and streaked hair \u2013 \n\n\u201cHello, Minister!\u201d bellowed Percy, sending a neat jinx straight at Thicknesse, who \ndropped his wand and clawed at the front of his robes, apparently in awful discomfort. \n\u201cDid I mention I\u2019m resigning?\u201d \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re joking, Perce!\u201d shouted Fred as the Death Eater he was battling collapsed \nunder the weight of three separate Stunning Spells. Thicknesse had fallen to the ground \nwith tiny spikes erupting all over him; he seemed to be turning into some form of sea \nurchin. Fred looked at Percy with glee. \n\n\u201cYou actually are joking, Perce. . . . I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve heard you joke since you \nwere \u2013\u201c \n\nThe air exploded. They had been grouped together, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, \nand Percy, the two Death Eaters at their feet, one Stunned, the other Transfigured; and in \nthat fragment of a moment, when danger seemed temporarily at bay, the world was rent \napart, Harry felt himself flying through the air, and all he could do was hold as tightly as \npossible to that thin stick of wood that was his one and only weapon, and shield his head \nin his arms: He heard the screams and yells of his companions without a hope of knowing \nwhat had happened to them \u2013 \n\nAnd then the world resolved itself into pain and semidarkness: He was half buried \nin the wreckage of a corridor that had been subjected to a terrible attack. Cold air told \nhim that the side of the castle had been blown away, and hot stickiness on his cheek told \nhim that he was bleeding copiously. Then he heard a terrible cry that pulled at his insides, \nthat expressed agony of a kind neither flame nor curse could cause, and he stood up, \nswaying, more frightened than he had been that day, more frightened, perhaps, than he \nhad been in his life. . . . \n\nAnd Hermione was struggling to her feet in the wreckage, and three redheaded \nmen were grouped on the ground where the wall had blasted apart. Harry grabbed \nHermione\u2019s hand as they staggered and stumbled over stone and wood. \n\n\u201cNo \u2013 no \u2013 no!\u201d someone was shouting. \u201cNo! Fred! No!\u201d \n\nAnd Percy was shaking his brother, and Ron was kneeling beside them, and Fred\u2019s eyes \nstared without seeing, the ghost of his last laugh still etched upon his face. \n\n\n \n\n \n\nChapter Thirty-Two \n\nThe Elder Wand \n\n \nThe world had ended, so why had the battle not ceased, the castle \nfallen silent in horror, and every combatant laid down their arms? \nHarry's mind was in free fall, spinning out of control, unable to \ngrasp the impossibility, because Fred Weasley could not be dead, \nthe evidence of all his senses must be lying-- \nAnd then a body fell past the hole blown into the side of the \n\n\f\nschool and curses flew in at them from the darkness, hitting the \nwall behind their heads. \n\"Get down!\" Harry shouted, as more curses flew through the night: \nHe and Ron had both grabbed Hermione and pulled her to the floor, \nbut Percy lay across Fred's body, shielding it from further harrm, \nand when Harry shouted \"Percy, come on, we've got to move!\" he \nshook his head. \n\"Percy!\" Harry saw tear tracks streaking the grime coating ron's \nface as he sezied his elder brother's shoulders and pulled, but \nPercy would not budge. \"Percy, you can't do anything for him! We're \ngoing to--\" \nHermione screamed, and Harry, turning, did not need to ask why. A \nmonstrous spider the size of a small car was trying to climb \nthrough the huge hole in the wall. one of Aragog's descendants had \njoined the fight. \nRon and Harry shouted together; their spells collided and the \nmonster was blown backward, its legs jerking horribly, and vanished \ninto the darkness. \n\"It brought friends!\" Harry called to the others, glancing over the \nedge of the castle through the hole in the wall the curses had \nblasted. More giant spiders were climbing the side of the building, \nliberated from the Forbidden Forest, into which the Death Eaters \nmust have penetrated. Harry fired Stunning Spells down upon them, \nknocking the lead monster into its fellows, so that they rolled \nback down the building and out of sight. Then more curses came \nsoaring over Harry's head, so close he felt the force of them blow \nhis hair. \n\"Let's move, NOW!\" \nPushing Hermione ahead of him with ron, Harry stooped to seize \nFred's body under the armpit. Percy, realizing what Harry was \ntrying to do, stopped clinging to the body and helped: together, \ncrouching low to avoid the curses flying at them from the grounds, \nthey hauled Fred out of the way. \n\"Here,\" said Harry, and they placed him in a niche where a suit of \narmor had stood earlier. He could not bear to look at Fred a second \nlonger than he had to, and after making sure that the body was well- \nhidden, he took off after ron and Hermione. Malfoy and Goyle had \nvanished but at the end of the corridor, which was now full of dust \nand falling masonry, glass long gone from windows, he saw many \npeople running backward and forward, whether friends or foes he \ncould not tell. Rounding the corner, Percy let out a bull-like \nroar: \"ROOKWOOD!\" and sprinted off in the direction of a tall man, \nwho was pursuing a couple of students. \n\"Harry, in here!\" Hermione screamed. \nShe had pulled Ron behind a tapestry. They seemed to be wrestling \ntogether, and for one mad second Harry thought that they were \n\n\f\nembracing again; then hhe saw that Hermione was trying to restrain \nRon, to stop him running after Percy. \n\"Listen to me--LISTEN RON!\" \n\"I wanna help--I wanna kill Death Eaters--\" \nHis face was contorted, smeared with dust and smoke, and he was \nshaking with rage and grief. \n\"ron, we're the only ones who can end it! Please--ron--we need the \nsnake, we've got to kill the snake!\" said Hermione. \nBut Harry knew how Ron felt: Pursuing another Horcrux could not \nbring the satisfaction of revenge; he too wanted to fight, to \npunish them, the people who had killed Fred, and he wanted to find \nthe other Weasleys, and above all make sure, make quite sure, that \nGinny was not--but he could not permit that idea to form in his \nmind-- \n\"We will fight!\" Hermione said. \"We'll have to, to reach the snake! \nBut let's not lose sight now of what we're supposed to be d-doing! \nWe're the only ones who can end it!\" \nShe was crying too, and she wiped her face on her torn and singed \nsleeve as she spoke, but she took great heaving breaths to calm \nherself as, still keeping a tight hold on ron, she turned to Harry. \n\"You need to find out where Voldemort is, because he'll have the \nsnake with him, won't he? Do it, Harry--look inside him!\" \nWhy was it so easy? Because his scar had been burning for hours, \nyearning to show him Voldemort's thoughts? He closed his eyes on \nher command, and at once, the screams and bangs and all the \ndiscordant sounds of the battle were drowned until they became \ndistant, as though he stood far, far away from them... \nHe was standing in the middle of a desolate but strangely familiar \nroom, with peeling paper on the walls and all the windows boarded \nup except for one. The sounds of the assault on the castle were \nmuffled and distant. The single unblocked window revealed distant \nbursts of light where the castle stood, but inside the room was \ndark except for a solitary oil lamp. \nHe was rolling his wand between his figners, watching it, his \nthoughts on the room in the castle, the secret room only he had \never found, the room, like the chamber, that you had to be clever \nand cunning and inquisitive to discover...He was confident that the \nboy would not find the diadem...although Dumbledore's puppet had \ncome much farther than he ever expected...too far... \n\"My Lord,\" said a voice, desperate and cracked. He turned: there \nwas Lucius Malfoy sitting in the darkest corner, ragged and still \nbearing the marks of the punishment he had received after the boy's \nlast escape. One of his eyes remained closed and puffy. \"My \nLord...please...my son...\" \n\"If your son is dead, Lucius, it is not my fault. He did not come \nand join me, like the rest of the Slytherins. Perhaps he has \n\n\f\ndecided to befriend Harry Potter?\" \n\"No--never,\" whispered Malfoy. \n\"You must hope not.\" \n\"Aren't--aren't you afraid, my Lord that Potter might die at \nanother hand but yours?\" asked Malfoy, his voice shaking. \"Wouldn't \nit be...forgive me...more prudent to call off this battle, enter \nthe castle, and seek him y-yourself?\" \n\"Do not pretend Lucius. You wish the battle to cease so that you \ncan discover what has happened to your son. And i do not need to \nseek Potter. Before the night is out, Potter will have come to find \nme.\" \nVoldemort dropped his gaze once more to the wand in his fingers. It \ntroubled him...and those things that troubled Lord Voldemort needed \nto be rearranged... \n\"Go and fetch Snape.\" \n\"Snape, m-my Lord?\" \n\"Snape. Now. I need him. There is a --service--I require from him. \nGo.\" \nFrightened, stumbling a little through the gloom, Lucius left the \nroom. Vodlemort continued to stand there, twirling the wand between \nhis fingers, staring at it. \n\"It is the only way, Nagini,\" he whispered, and he looked around, \nand there was the great thick snake, now suspended in midair, \ntwisting gracefully within the enchanted, protected space he had \nmade for her, a starry, transparent sphere somewhere between a \nglittering cage and a tank. \nWith a gasp, Harry pulled back and opened his yees at the same \nmoment his ears were assaulted with the screeches and cries, the \nsmashes and bangs of battle. \n\"He's in the Shrieking Shack. The snake's with him, it's got some \nsort of magical protection around it. He's just sent Lucius Malfoy \nto find Snape.\" \n\"voldemort's sitting in the shrieking Shack?\" said Hermione, \noutraged. \"He's not--he's not even FIGHTING?\" \n\"He doesn't think he needs to fight,\" said Harry. \"He thinks I'm \ngoing to go to him.\" \n\"But why?\" \n\"He knows I'm after Horcruxes--he's keeping Nagini close beside him- \n-obviously I'm going to have to go to him to get near the thing--\" \n\"Right,\" said Ron, squaring his shoulders. \"So you can't go, that's \nwhat he wants, what he's expecting. You stay here and look after \nHermione, and I'll go and get it--\" \nHarry cut across Ron. \n\"You two stay here, I'll go under the Cloak and I'll be back as \nsoon as I--\" \n\"No,\" said Hermione,, \"it makes much more sense if I take the Cloak \n\n\f\nand--\" \n\"Don't even think about it,\" Ron snarled at her. \nbefore Hermione could get farther than \"Ron, I'm just as capable -- \n\" the tapestry at the top of the staircase on which they stood was \nripped open. \n\"POTTER!\" \nTwo masked Death Eaters stood there, but even before their wands \nwere fully raised, Hermione shouted \"Glisseo!\" \nThe stairs beneath their feet flatteneed into a chute and she, \nHarry, and Ron hurtled down it, unable to control their speed but \nso fast that the Death Eaters' Stunning Spells flew far over their \nheads. They shot through the concealing tapestry at the bottom and \nspun onto the floor, hitting the opposite wall. \n\"Duro!\" cried Hermione, pointing her wand at the tapestry, and \nthere were two loud, sickening crunches as the tapestry turned to \nstone and the Death Eaters pursuing them crumpled against it. \n\"Get back!\" shouted Ron, and he, Harry, and Hermione hurled \nthemselves against a door as a herd of galloping desks thundered \npast, shepherdd by a sprinting Professor McGonagall. She appeared \nnot to notice them. Her hair had come down and there was a gash on \nher cheek. As she turned the corner, they heard her scream, \n\"CHARGE!\" \n\"Harry, you get the Cloak on,\" said Hermione. \"Never mind us--\" \nBut he threw it over all three of them; large though they were he \ndoubted anyone would see their disembodied feet through the dust \nthat clogged the air, the falling stone, the shimmer of spells. \nthey ran down the next staircase and found themselves in a corridor \nfull of duelers. The portraits on either side of the fighters were \ncrammed with figures screaming advice and encouragement, while \nDeath Eaters, both masked and unmasked, dueled students and \nteachers. Dean had won himself a wand, for he was face-to-face with \nDolohov, Parvati with Travers. Harry, ron and Hermione raised their \nwands at once, ready to strike, but the duelers were weaving and \ndarting so much that there was a strong likelihood of hurting on of \ntheir own side if they cast curses. Even as they stood braced, \nlooking for the opportunity to act, there came a great \"Wheeeeee!\" \nand looking up, Harry saw Peeves zoomign over them, dropping \nSnargaluff pods down onto the Death Eaters, whose heads were \nsuddenly engulfed in wriggling green tubers like fat worms. \n\"ARGH!\" \nA fistful of tubers had hit the Cloak over Ron's head; the damp \ngreen roots were suspended improbably in midair as Ron tried to \nshake them loose. \n\"Someone's invisible there!\" shouted a masked Death Eater, pointing. \nDean made the most of the Death Eater's momentary distraction, \nknocking him out with a stunning Spell; Dolohov attempted to \n\n\f\nretaliate, and Parvati shot a Body Bind Curse at him. \n\"LET'S GO!\" Harry yelled, and he, Ron, and Hermione gathered the \nCloak tightly around themselves and pelted, heads down, through the \nmidst of the fighters, slipping a little in pools of Snargaluff \njuice, toward the top of the marble staircase into the entrance \nhall. \n\"I'm Draco Malfoy, I'm Draco, I'm on your side!\" \nDraco was on the upper landing, pleading with anoter masked Death \nEater. Harry Stunned the Death Eater as they passed. Malfoy looked \naround, beaming, for his savior, and Ron punched him from under the \nCloak. Malfoy fell backward on top of the Death Eater, his mouth \nbleeding, utterly bemused. \n\"And that's the second time we've saved your life tonight, you two- \nfaced bastard!\" Ron yelled. \nThere were more duelers all over the stairs and in the hall. Death \nEaters everywhere Harry looked: Yaxley, close to the front doors, \nin combat with Flitwick, a masked Death Eater dueling Kingsley \nright beside them. Students ran in every direction; some carrying \nor dragging injured friends. Harry directed a Stunnning Spell \ntoward the masked Death Eater; it missed but nearly hit Neville, \nwho had emerged from nowhere brandishing armfuls of Venomous \nTentacula, which looped itself happily around the nearest Death \nEater and began reeling him in. \nHarry, Ron, and Hermione sped won the marble staircase: glass \nshattered on the left, and the Slytherin hourglass that had \nrecorded House points spilled its emeralds everywhere, so that \npeople slipped and staggered as they ran. Two bodies fell from the \nbalcony overhead as they reached the ground a gray blur that Harry \ntook for an animal sped four-legged across the hall to sink its \nteeth into one of the fallen. \n\"NO!\" shrieked Hermione, and with a deafening blast from her wand, \nFenrir Greyback was thrown backward from the feebly struggling body \nof Lavender Brown. He hit the marble banisters and struggled to \nreturn to his feet. Then, with a bright white flash and a crack, a \ncrystal ball fell on top of his head, and he crumpled to the ground \nand did not move. \n\"I have more!\" shrieked Professor Trelawney from over the \nbanisters. \"More for any who want them! Here--\" \nAnd with a move likea tennis serve, she heaved another enormous \ncrystal sphere from her bag, waved her wand through the air, and \ncaused the ball to speed across the hall and smash through a \nwindow. At the same moment, the heavy wooden front doors burst \nopen, and more of the gigantic spiders forced their way into the \nfront hall. \nScreams of terror rent the air: the fighters scattered, Death \nEaters and Hogwartians alike, and red and green jets of light flew \n\n\f\ninto the midst of the oncoming monsters, which shuddered and \nreared, more terrifying than ever. \n\"How do we get out?\" yelled ron over all the screaming, but before \neither Harry or Hermione could answer they were bowled aside; \nHagrid had come thundering down the stairs, brandishing his flowery \npink umbrella. \n\"Don't hurt 'em, don't hurt 'em!\" he yelled. \n\"HAGRID, NO!\" \nHarry forgot everything else: he sprinted out from under the cloak, \nrunning bent double to avoid the curses illuminating the whole hall. \n\"HAGRID, COME BACK!\" \nBut he was not even halfway to Hagrid when he saw it happen: Hagrid \nvanished amongst the spiders, and with a great scurrying, a foul \nswarming movement, they retreated under the onslaught of spells, \nHagrid buried in their midst. \n\"HAGRID!\" Harry heard someone calling his own name, whether friend \nor foe he did not care: He was springint down the front steps into \nthe dark grounds, and the spiders were swarming away with their \nprey, and he could see nothing of Hagrid at all. \n\"HAGRID!\" \nHe thought he could make out an enormous arm waving from the mdist \nof the spider swarm, but as he made to chase after them, his way \nwas impeded by a monumental foot, which swung down out of the \ndarkness and made the ground on which he stood shudder. He looked \nup: A giant stood before him, twenty feet high, its head ihidden in \nshadow, nothing but its treelike, hairy shins illuminated by light \nfrom the castle doors. With one brutal, fluid movement, it smashed \na massive fist through an upper window, and glass rained down upon \nHarryk, forcing him back under the shelter of the doorway. \n\"Oh my--!\" shrieked Hermione, as she and ron caught up with Harry \nand gazed upward at the giant now trying to seize people through \nthe window above. \n\"DON'T!\" ron yelled, grabbing Hermione's hand as she raised her \nwand. \"Stun him and he'll crush half the castle--\" \n\"HAGGER?\" \nGrawp came lurching around the corner of the castle; only dnow did \nHarry realzie that Grawp was, indeed, an undersized giant. The \ngargantuan monster trying to crush people on the upper floors \nturned around and let out a rorar. The stone steps tremebled as he \nstomped toward his smaller kin, and Grawp's lopsided mouth fell \nopen, showing yellow, half brick-sized teeth; and then they \nlaunched themselves at each other with the savagery of lions. \n\"RUN!\" Harry roared; the ngiht was full of hideous yells and blows \nas the giants wrestled, and he seized Hermione's hand and tore down \nthe steps into the grounds, Ron bringing up the rear. Harry had not \nlost hope of finding and saving Hagrid; he ran so fast that they \n\n\f\nwere halfway toward the forest before they were brought up short \nagain. \nThe air around them had frozen: Harry's breath caught and \nsolidified in his chest. Shapes moved out in the darkness, swirling \nfigures of concentrated blackness, moving in a great wave towards \nthe castles, their faces hooded and their breath rattling... \nron and Hermione closed in beside him as the sounds of fighting \nbehind them grew suddenly muted, deadened, because a silence only \ndementors could bring was falling thickly through the night, and \nFred was gone, and Hagrid was suurely dying or already dead... \n\"come on, Harry!\" said Hermione's voice from a very long way away. \n\"Patronuses, Harry, come on!\" \nhe raised his wand, but a dull hopelessness was spreading \nthroughout him: How many more lay dead that he did not yet know \nabout? He felt as though his soul had already half left his body.... \n\"HARRY, COME ON!\" screamed Hermione. \nA hundred dementors were advancing, gliding toward them, sucking \ntheir way closer to Harry's despair, which was like a promise of a \nfeast... \nHe saw Ron's silver terrier burst into the air, flicker feebly, and \nexpire; he saw Hermione's otter twist in midair and fade, and his \nown wand trembled in his hand, and he almost welcomed the oncoming \noblivion, the promise of nothing, of no feeling... \nAnd then a silver hare, a boar, and fox soared past Harry, Ron, and \nHermione's heads: the dementors fell back before the creatures' \napproach. Three more people had arrived out of the darkness to \nstand beside them, their wands outstretched, continuing to cast \nPatronuses: Luna, Ernie, and Seamus. \n\"That's right,\" said Luna encouragingly, as if they were back in \nthe Room of Requirement and this was simply spell practice for the \nD.A., \"That's right, Harry...come on think of something happy...\" \n'something happy?\" he said, his voice cracked. \n\"We're all still here,\" she whispered, \"we;re still fighting. Come \non, now....\" \nThere was a silver spark, then a wavering light, and then, with the \ngreatest effort it had ever cost him the stag burst from the end of \nHarry's wand. It cantered forward, and now the dementors scattered \nin earnest, and immediately the night was mild again, but the \nsounds of the surrounding battle were loud in his ears. \n\"Can't thank you enough,\" said ron shakily, turning to Luna, Ernie, \nand Seamus \"you just saved--\" \nWith a roar and an earth-quaking tremor, another giant came \nlurching out of the darkness from the direction of the forest, \nbrandishing a club taller than any of them. \n\"RUN!\" Harry shouted again, but the others needed no telling; They \nall scattered, and not a second too soon, for the next moment the \n\n\f\ncreature's vast foot had fallen exactly where they had been \nstanding. Harry looked round: ron and Hermione were following him, \nbut the other three had vanished back into the battle. \n\"Let's get out of range!\" yelled Ron as the giant swung its club \nagain and its bellows echoed through the night, across the grounds \nwehere bursts of red and green light continued to illuminate the \ndarkness. \n\"The Whomping willow,\" said Harry, \"go!\" \nSomehow he walled it all up in his mind, crammed it into a small \nspace into which he could not look now: thoughts of Fred and \nHagrid, and his terror for all the people he loved, scattered in \nand outside the castle, must all wait, because they had to run, had \nto reach the snake and Voldemort, because that was, as Hermione \nsaid, the only way to end it-- \nHe sprinted, half-believing he could outdistance death itself, \nignoring the jets of light flying in the darkness all around him, \nand the sound of hte lake crashing like the sea, and the creaking \nof the Forbidden Forest though the night was windless; through \ngrounds that seemed themselves to have risen in rebellion, he ran \nfaster than he had ever moved in his life, and it was he who saw \nthe great tree first, the Willow that protected the secret at its \nroots with whiplike, slashing branches. \nPanting and gasping, Harry slowed down, skirting the willow's \nswiping branches, peering through the darkness toward its tick \ntrunk, trying to see the single knot in the bark of the old tree \nthat would paralyze it. Ron and Hermione caught up, Hermione so out \nof breath that she could not speak. \n\"How--how're we going to get in?\" panted ron. \"I can--see the palce- \n-if we jsut had--Crookshanks again--\" \n\"Crookshanks?\" wheezed Hermione, bent double, clutching her chest. \n\"Are you a wizard, or what?\" \n\"Oh--right--yeah--\" \nRon looked around, then directed his wand at a twig on the ground \nand said \"Winguardium Leviosa!\" The twig flew up from the gruond, \nspun through the air as if caught by a gust of wind, then zoomed \ndirectly at the trunk through the Willow's ominously swaying \nbranches. It jabbed at a place near the roots, and at once, the \nwrithing tree became still. \n\"Perfect!\" panted Hermione. \n\"Wait.\" \nFor one teetering second, while the crashes and booms of the battle \nfilled the air, Harry hesitated. Voldemort wanted him to do this, \nwanted him to come...Was he leading Ron and Hermione into a trap? \nBut the reality seemed to close upon him, cruel and plain: the only \nway forward was to kill the snake, and the snake was where \nVoldemort was, and voldemort was at the end of this tunnel... \n\n\f\n\"Harry, we're coming, just get in there!\" said Ron, pushing him \nforward. \nHarry wriggled into the earthy passage hidden in the tree's roots. \nIt was a much tighter squeeze than it had been the last time they \nhad entered it. The tunnel was low-ceilinged: they had had to \ndouble up to move throuhgh it nearly four years previously; now \nthere was nothing for it but to crawl. Harry went first, his wand \nilluminated, expecting at any moment to meet barriers, but none \ncame. They moved in silence, Harry's gaze fixed upon the swinging \nbeam of the wand held in his fist. At last, the tunnel began to \nslope upward and Harry saw a sliver of light ahead. Hermione tugged \nat his ankle. \n\"The Cloak!\" she whispered. \"Put the Cloak on!\" \nHe groped behind him and she forced the bundle of slippery cloth \ninto his free hand. With difficulty he dragged it over himself, \nmurmered, \"Nox,\" extinguishing his wandlight, and continued on his \nhands and knees, as silently as possible, all his senses straining, \nexpecting every second to be discovered, to hear a cold clear \nvoice, see a flash of green light. \nand then he heard voices coming from the room directly ahead of \nthem, only slightly muffled by the fact that the opening at the \nendo fht etuunnel had been blocked up by what looked like an old \ncrate. Hardly daring to breathe, Harry edged right up tot he \nopening and peered through a tiny gap left between crate and wall. \nThe room beyond was dimly lit, but he could see Nagini, swirlign \nand coiling like a serpent underwater, safe in her enchanted, \nstarry sphere, which floated unsupported in midair. He could see \nthe edge of a table, and a long-fingered white hand toying with a \nwand. \nThen Snape spoke, and Harry's heart lurched: Snape was inches away \nfrom where he crouched, hidden. \n\"...my Lord, their resistance is crumbling--\" \n\"--and it is doing so without your help,\" said Voldemort in his \nhigh, clear voice. \"Skilled wizard though you are, Severus, I do \nnot think you will make much difference now. We are almost \nthere...almost.\" \n\"Let me find the boy. Let me bring you Potter. I know I can find \nhim, my Lord. Please.\" \nSnape strode past the gap, and Harry drew back a little, keeping \nhis eyes fixed upon Nagini, wondering whether there was any spell \nthat might penetrate the protection surrounding her, but he could \nnot think of anything. One failed attempt, and he would give away \nhis position... \nVoldemort stood up. Harry could see him now, see the red eyes, the \nflattened, serpentine face, the pallor of him gleaming slightly in \nthe semidarkness. \n\n\f\n\"I have a problem, Severus,\" said Voldemort softly. \n\"My Lord?\" said Snape. \nVoldemort raised the Elder Wand, holding it as delicately and \nprecisely as a conductor's baton. \n\"Why doesn't it work for me, Severus?\" \nIn the silence Harry imagined he could hear the snake hissing \nslightly as it coiled and uncoiled--or was it Voldemort's sibilant \nsigh lingering on the air? \n\"My--my lord?\" said Snape blankly. \"I do not understand. You--you \nhave performed extraordinary magic with that wand.\" \n\"No,\" said Voldemort. \"I have performed my usual magic. I am \nextraordinary, but this wand...no. It has not revealed the wonders \nit has promised. I feel no difference between this wand and the one \nI procured from Ollivander all those years ago.\" \nVoldemort's tone was musing, calm, but Harry's scar had begun to \nthrob and pulse: Pain was building in his forehead, and he could \nfeel that controlled sense of fury building inside Voldemort. \n\"No difference,\" said Voldemort again. \nSnape did not speak. Harry could not see his face. He wondered \nwhether Snape sensed danger, was trying to find the right words to \nreassure his master. \nVoldemort started to move around the room: Harry lost sight of him \nfor seconds as he prowled, speaking in that same measured voice, \nwhile the pain and fury mounted in Harry. \n\"I have thought long and hard, Severus...do you know why I have \ncalled you back from battle?\" \nAnd for a moment Harry saw Snape's profile. His eyes were fixed \nupon the coiling snake in its enchanted cage. \n\"No, my Lord, but I beg you will let me return. Let me find Potter.\" \n\"You sound like Lucius. Neither of you understands Potter as I do. \nHe does not need finding. Potter will come to me. I knew his \nweakness you see, his one great flaw. He will hate watching the \nothers struck down around him, knwoing that it is for him that it \nhappens. He will want to stop it at any cost. He will come.\" \n\"But my Lord, he might be killed accidentally by someone other than \nyourself--\"\\ \n\"My instructions to the Death Eaters have been perfectly clear. \nCapture Potter. Kill his friends--the more, the better--but do not \nkill him. \n\"But it is of you that I wished to speak, Severus, not Harry \nPotter. You have been very valuable to me. Very valuable.\" \n\"My Lord knows I seek only to serve him. But--let me go and find \nthe boy, my Lord. Let me bring him to you. I know I can--\" \n\"I have told you, no!\" said Voldemort, and Harry caught the lgint \nof red in his eyes as he turned again, and the swishing of his \ncloak was like the slithering of a snake, and he felt Voldemort's \n\n\f\nimpatience in his burning scar. \"My concern at the moment, Severus, \nis what will happen when I finally meet the boy!\" \n\"My Lord, there can be no question, surely--?\" \n\"--but there is a question, Severus. There is.\" \nVoldemort halted, and Harry could see him plainly again as he slid \nthe Elder Wand through his white fingers, staring at Snape. \n\"Why did both the wands I have used fail when directed at Harry \nPotter?\" \n\"I--I cannot answer that, my Lord.\" \n\"Can't you?\" \nThe stab of rage felt like a spike driven through Harry's head: he \nforced his own fist into his mouth to stop himself from crying out \nin pain. He closed his eyes, and suddenly he was Voldemort, looking \ninto Snape's pale face. \n\"My wand of yew did everything of which I asked it, Severus, except \nto kill Harry Potter. Twice it failed. Ollivander told me under \ntorture of the twin cores, told me to take another's wand. I did \nso, but Lucius's wand shattered upon meeting Potter's.\" \n\"I--I have no explanation, my Lord.\" \nSnape was not looking at Voldemort now. His dark eyes were still \nfixed upon the coiling serpent in its protective sphere. \n\"I sought a third wand, Severus. the Elder Wand, the Wand of \nDestiny, the Deathstick. I took it from its previous master. I took \nit from the grfave of Albus Dumbledore.\" \nAnd now Snape looked at Voldemort, and Snape's face was like a \ndeath mask. it was marble white and so still that when he spoke, it \nwas a shock to see that anyone lived behind the blank eyes. \n\"My Lord--let me go to the boy--\" \n\"all this long night when I am on the brink of victory, I have sat \nhere,\" said Voldemort, his voice barely louder than a whisper, \n\"wondering, wondering, why the Elder Wand refuses to be what it \nought to be, refuses to perform as legend says it must perform for \nits rightful owner...and I think I have the answer.\" \nSnape did not speak. \n\"Perhaps you already know it? You are a clever man, after all, \nSeverus. You have been a good and faithful servant, and I regret \nwhat must happen.\" \n\"My Lord--\" \n\"The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly, Severus, because I am not \nits true master. The Elder Wand belongs to the wizard who killed \nits last owner. You killed Albus Dumbledore. While you live, \nSeverus, the Elder Wand cannot truly be mine.\" \n\"My Lord!\" Snape protested, raising his wand. \n\"It cannot be any other way,\" said Voldemort. \"I must master the \nwand, Severus. Master the wand, and I master Potter at last.\" \nAnd Voldemort swiped the air with the Elder Wand. It did nothing to \n\n\f\nSanpe, who for a split second seemed to think he had been \nreprieved: but then Voldemort's intention became clear. The snake's \ncage was rolling through the air, and before Snape could do \nanything more than yell, it had encased him, head and shoulders, \nand Voldemort spoke in Parseltongue. \n\"Kill.\" \nThere was a terrible scream. Harry saw Snape's face losing the \nlittle color it had left; it whitened as his black eyes widened, as \nthe snake's fangs pierced his neck, as he failed to push the \nenchanted cage off himself, as his knees gave way and he fell to \nthe floor. \n\"I regret it,\" said Voldemort coldly. \nHe turned away; there was no sadness in him, no remorse. It was \ntime to leave this shack and take charge, with a wand that would \nnow do his full bidding. He pointed it at the starry cage holding \nthe snake, which drifted upward, off snape, who fell sideways onto \nthe floor, blood gushing from the wounds in his neck. Voldemort \nswept from the room without a backward glance, and the great \nserpent floated after him in its huge protective sphere. \nBack in the tunnel and his own mind, Harry opened his eyes; He had \ndrawn blood biting down on his knuckles in an effort not to shout \nout. Now he was looking through the tiny crack between crate and \nwall, watching a foot in a black boot trembling on the floor. \n\"Harry!\" breathed Hermione behind him, but he had already pointed \nhis wand at the crate blocking his view. It lifted an inch into the \nair and drifted sideways silently. As quietly as he could, he \npulled himself up into the room. \nHe did not know why he was doing it, why he was approaching the \ndying man: he did not know what he felt as he saw Snape's white \nface, adn the fingers trying to staunch the bloody wound at his \nneck. Harry took off the invisibility cloak and looked down upon \nthe man he hated, whose widening black eyes found Harry as he cried \nto speak. Harry bent over him, and Snape seized the front of his \nrobes and pulled him close. \nA terrible rasping, gurgling noise issued from Snape's throat. \n\"Take...it...Take...it...\" \nSomething more than blood was leaking from Snape. Silvery blue, \nneither gas nor liquid, it gushed form his mouth and his ears and \nhis eyes, and Harry knew what it was, but did not know what to do-- \nA flask, conjured from thin air, was thrust into his shaking hand \nby Hermione. Harry lfited the silvery substance into it with his \nwand. When the falsk was full to the brim, and Snape looked as \nthough there was no blood left in him, his grip on Harry's robes \nslackened. \n\"Look...at....me...\" he whispered. \nThe green eyes found the black, but after a second, something in \n\n\f\nthe depths of the dark pari seemed to vanish, leaving them fixed, \nblank, and empty. The hand holding Harry thudded to the floor, and \nSnape moved no more. \n\n \n\nChapter Thirty-Three \n\nThe Prince\u2019s Tale \n\n \n\nHarry remained kneeling at Snape\u2019s side, simply staring down at him, until quite \nsuddenly a high, cold voice spoke so close to them that Harry jumped on his feet, the \nflask gripped tightly in his hands, thinking that Voldemort had reentered the room. \n\n Voldemort\u2019s voice reverberated from the walls and floor, and Harry realized that \nhe was talking to Hogwarts and to all the surrounding area, that the residents of \nHogsmeade and all those still fighting in the castle would hear him as clearly as if he \nstood beside them, his breath on the back of their necks, a deathblow away. \n\n \u201cYou have fought,\u201d said the high, cold voice, \u201cvaliantly. Lord Voldemort knows \nhow to value bravery. \n\n \u201cYet you have sustained heavy losses. If you continue to resist me, you will all \ndie, one by one. I do not wish this to happen. Every drop of magical blood spilled is a \nloss and a waste. \n\n \u201cLord Voldemort is merciful. I command my forces to retreat immediately. \n\n \u201cYou have one hour. Dispose of your dead with dignity. Treat your injured. \n\n \u201cI speak now, Harry Potter, directly to you. You have permitted your friends to \ndie for you rather than face me yourself. I shall wait for one hour in the Forbidden Forest. \nIf, at the end of that hour, you have not come to me, have not given yourself up, then \nbattle recommences. This time, I shall enter the fray myself, Harry Potter, and I shall find \nyou, and I shall punish every last man, woman, and child who has tried to conceal you \nfrom me. One hour.\u201d \n\n Both Ron and Hermione shook their heads frantically, looking at Harry. \n\n \u201cDon\u2019t listen to him,\u201d said Ron. \n\n \u201cIt\u2019ll be all right,\u201d said Hermione wildly. \u201cLet\u2019s \u2013 let\u2019s get back to the castle, if \nhe\u2019s gone to the forest we\u2019ll need to think of a new plan \u2013 \u201d \n\n She glanced at Snape\u2019s body, then hurried back to the tunnel entrance. Ron \nfollowed her. Harry gathered up the Invisibility Cloak, then looked down at Snape. He \ndid not know what to feel, except shock at the way Snape had been killed, and the reason \nfor which it had been done\u2026 \n\n They crawled back through the tunnel, none of them talking, and Harry wondered \nwhether Ron and Hermione could still hear Voldemort ringing in their heads as he could. \n\n You have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself. I \nshall wait for one hour in the Forbidden Forest\u2026One hour\u2026 \n\n Small bundles seemed to litter the lawn at the front of the castle (?). It could only \nbe an hour or so from dawn, yet it was pitch-black. The three of them hurried toward the \nstone steps. A lone dog, the size of a small boat, lay abandoned in front of them. There \nwas no other sign of Grawp or of his attacker. \n\n\f\n The castle was unnaturally silent. There were no flashes of light now, no bangs or \nscreams or shouts. The flagstones of the deserted entrance hall were stained with blood. \nEmeralds were still scattered all over the floor, along with pieces of marble and splintered \nwood. Part of the banisters had been blown away. \n\n \u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d whispered Hermione. \n\n Ron led the way to the Great Hall. Harry stopped in the doorway. \n\n The House tables were gone and the room was crowded. The survivors stood in \ngroups, their arms around each other\u2019s necks. The injured were being treated upon the \nraised platform by Madam Pomfrey and a group of helpers. Firenze was amongst the \ninjured; his flank poured blood and he shook where he lay, unable to stand. \n\n The dead lay in a row in the middle of the Hall. Harry could not see Fred\u2019s body, \nbecause his family surrounded him. George was kneeling at his head; Mrs. Weasley was \nlying across Fred\u2019s chest, her body shaking. Mr. Weasley stroking her hair while tears \ncascaded down his cheeks. \n\n Without a word to Harry, Ron and Hermione walked away. Harry saw Hermione \napproach Ginny, whose face was swollen and blotchy, and hug her. Ron joined Bill, Fleur, \nand Percy, who flung an arm around Ron\u2019s shoulders. As Ginny and Hermione moved \ncloser to the rest of the family, Harry had a clear view of the bodies lying next to Fred. \nRemus and Tonks, pale and still and peaceful-looking, apparently asleep beneath the dark, \nenchanted ceiling. \n\n The Great Hall seemed to fly away, become smaller, shrink, as Harry reeled \nbackward from the doorway. He could not draw breath. He could not bear to look at any \nof the other bodies, to see who else had died for him. He could not bear to join the \nWeasleys, could not look into their eyes, when if he had given himself up in the first \nplace, Fred might never have died\u2026 \n\n He turned away and ran up the marble staircase. Lupin, Tonks\u2026 He yearned not \nto feel\u2026 He wished he could rip out his heart, his innards, everything that was screaming \ninside him\u2026 \n\n The castle was completely empty; even the ghosts seemed to have joined the mass \nmourning in the Great Hall. Harry ran without stopping, clutching the crystal flask of \nSnape\u2019s last thoughts, and he did not slow down until he reached the stone gargoyle \nguarding the headmaster\u2019s office. \n\n \u201cPassword?\u201d \n\n \u201cDumbledore!\u201d said Harry without thinking, because it was he whom he yearned \nto see, and to his surprise the gargoyle slid aside revealing the spiral staircase behind. \n\n But when Harry burst into the circular office he found a change. The portraits that \nhung all around the walls were empty. Not a single headmaster or headmistress remained \nto see him; all, it seemed, had flitted away, charging through the paintings that lined the \ncastle so that they could have a clear view of what was going on. \n\n Harry glanced hopelessly at Dumbledore\u2019s deserted frame, which hung directly \nbehind the headmaster\u2019s chair, then turned his back on it. The stone Pensieve lay in the \ncabinet where it had always been. Harry heaved it onto the desk and poured Snape\u2019s \nmemories into the wide basin with its runic markings around the edge. To escape into \nsomeone else\u2019s head would be a blessed relief\u2026 Nothing that even Snape had left him \ncould be worse than his own thoughts. The memories swirled, silver white and strange, \n\n\f\nand without hesitating, with a feeling of reckless abandonment, as though this would \nassuage his torturing grief, Harry dived. \n\n He fell headlong into sunlight, and his feet found warm ground. When he \nstraightened up, he saw that he was in a nearly deserted playground. A single huge \nchimney dominated the distant skyline. Two girls were swinging backward and forward, \nand a skinny boy was watching them from behind a clump of bushes. His black hair was \noverlong and his clothes were so mismatched that it looked deliberate: too short jeans, a \nshabby, overlarge coat that might have belonged to a grown man, an odd smocklike shirt. \n\n Harry moved closer to the boy. Snape looked no more than nine or ten years old, \nsallow, small, stringy. There was undisguised greed in his thin face as he watched the \nyounger of the two girls swinging higher and higher than her sister. \n\n \u201cLily, don\u2019t do it!\u201d shrieked the elder of the two. \n\n But the girl had let go of the swing at the very height of its arc and flown into the \nair, quite literally flown, launched herself skyward with a great shout of laughter, and \ninstead of crumpling on the playground asphalt, she soared like a trapeze artist through \nthe air, staying up far too long, landing far too lightly. \n\n \u201cMummy told you not to!\u201d \n\n Petunia stopped her swing by dragging the heels of her sandals on the ground, \nmaking a crunching, grinding sound, then leapt up, hands on hips. \n\n \u201cMummy said you weren\u2019t allowed, Lily!\u201d \n\n \u201cBut I\u2019m fine,\u201d said Lily, still giggling. \u201cTuney, look at this. Watch what I can \ndo.\u201d \n\n Petunia glanced around. The playground was deserted apart from themselves and, \nthough the girls did not know it, Snape. Lily had picked up a fallen flower from the bush \nbehind which Snape lurked. Petunia advanced, evidently torn between curiosity and \ndisapproval. Lily waited until Petunia was near enough to have a clear view, then held \nout her palm. The flower sat there, opening and closing its petals, like some bizarre, \nmany-lipped oyster. \n\n \u201cStop it!\u201d shrieked Petunia. \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s not hurting you,\u201d said Lily, but she closed her hand on the blossom and \nthrew it back to the ground. \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s not right,\u201d said Petunia, but her eyes had followed the flower\u2019s flight to the \nground and lingered upon it. \u201cHow do you do it?\u201d she added, and there was definite \nlonging in her voice. \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s obvious, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Snape could no longer contain himself, but had jumped \nout from behind the bushes. Petunia shrieked and ran backward toward the swings, but \nLily, though clearly startled, remained where she was. Snape seemed to regret his \nappearance. A dull flush of color mounted the sallow cheeks as he looked at Lily. \n\n \u201cWhat\u2019s obvious?\u201d asked Lily. \n\n Snape had an air of nervous excitement. With a glance at the distant Petunia, now \nhovering beside the swings, he lowered his voice and said, \u201cI know what you are.\u201d \n\n \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \n\n \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026you\u2019re a witch,\u201d whispered Snape. \n\n She looked affronted. \n\n \u201cThat\u2019s not a very nice thing to say to somebody!\u201d \n\n She turned, nose in the air, and marched off toward her sister. \n\n\f\n \u201cNo!\u201d said Snape. He was highly colored now, and Harry wondered why he did \nnot take off the ridiculously large coat, unless it was because he did not want to reveal the \nsmock beneath it. He flapped after the girls, looking ludicrously batlike, like his older self. \n\n The sisters considered him, united in disapproval, both holding on to one of the \nswing poles, as though it was the safe place in tag. \n\n \u201cYou are,\u201d said Snape to Lily. \u201cYou are a witch. I\u2019ve been watching you for a \nwhile. But there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. My mum\u2019s one, and I\u2019m a wizard.\u201d \n\n Petunia\u2019s laugh was like cold water. \n\n \u201cWizard!\u201d she shrieked, her courage returned now that she had recovered from \nthe shock of his unexpected appearance. \u201cI know who you are. You\u2019re that Snape boy! \nThey live down Spinner\u2019s End by the river,\u201d she told Lily, and it was evident from her \ntone that she considered the address a poor recommendation. \u201cWhy have you been spying \non us?\u201d \n\n \u201cHaven\u2019t been spying,\u201d said Snape, hot and uncomfortable and dirty-haired in the \nbright sunlight. \u201cWouldn\u2019t spy on you, anyway,\u201d he added spitefully, \u201cyou\u2019re a Muggle.\u201d \n\n Though Petunia evidently did not understand the word, she could hardly mistake \nthe tone. \n\n \u201cLily, come on, we\u2019re leaving!\u201d she said shrilly. Lily obeyed her sister at once, \nglaring at Snape as she left. He stood watching them as they marched through the \nplayground gate, and Harry, the only one left to observe him, recognized Snape\u2019s bitter \ndisappointment, and understood that Snape had been planning this moment for a while, \nand that it had all gone wrong\u2026 \n\n The scene dissolved, and before Harry knew it, re-formed around him. He was \nnow in a small thicket of trees. He could see a sunlit river glittering through their trunks. \nThe shadows cast by the trees made a basin of cool green shade. Two children sat facing \neach other, cross-legged on the ground. Snape had removed his coat now; his odd smock \nlooked less pecular in the half light. \n\n \u201c\u2026and the Ministry can punish you if you do magic outside school, you get \nletters.\u201d \n\n \u201cBut I have done magic outside school!\u201d \n\n \u201cWe\u2019re all right. We haven\u2019t got wands yet. They let you off when you\u2019re a kid \nand you can\u2019t help it. But once you\u2019re eleven,\u201d he nodded importantly, \u201cand they start \ntraining you, then you\u2019ve got to go careful.\u201d \n\n There was a little silence. Lily had picked up a fallen twig and twirled it in the air, \nand Harry knew that she was imagining sparks trailing from it. Then she dropped the twig, \nleaned in toward the boy, and said, \u201cIt is real, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s not a joke? Petunia says you\u2019re \nlying to me. Petunia says there isn\u2019t a Hogwarts. It is real, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s real for us,\u201d said Snape. \u201cNot for her. But we\u2019ll get the letter, you and me.\u201d \n\n \u201cReally?\u201d whispered Lily. \n\n \u201cDefinitely,\u201d said Snape, and even with his poorly cut hair and his odd clothes, he \nstruck an oddly impressive figure sprawled in front of her, brimful of confidence in his \ndestiny. \n\n \u201cAnd will it really come by owl?\u201d Lily whispered. \n\n \u201cNormally,\u201d said Snape. \u201cBut you\u2019re Muggle-born, so someone from the school \nwill have to come and explain to your parents.\u201d \n\n \u201cDoes it make a difference, being Muggle-born?\u201d \n\n\f\n Snape hesitated. His black eyes, eager in the greenish gloom, moved over the pale \nface, the dark red hair. \n\n \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any difference.\u201d \n\n \u201cGood,\u201d said Lily, relaxing. It was clear that she had been worrying. \n\n \u201cYou\u2019ve got loads of magic,\u201d said Snape. \u201cI saw that. All the time I was watching \nyou\u2026\u201d \n\n His voice trailed away; she was not listening, but had stretched out on the leafy \nground and was looking up at the canopy of leaves overhead. He watched her as greedily \nas he had watched her in the playground. \n\n \u201cHow are things at your house?\u201d Lily asked. \n\n A little crease appeared between his eyes. \n\n \u201cFine,\u201d he said. \n\n \u201cThey\u2019re not arguing anymore?\u201d \n\n \u201cOh yes, they\u2019re arguing,\u201d said Snape. He picked up a fistful of leaves and began \ntearing them apart, apparently unaware of what he was doing. \u201cBut it won\u2019t be that long \nand I\u2019ll be gone.\u201d \n\n \u201cDoesn\u2019t your dad like magic?\u201d \n\n \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like anything, much,\u201d said Snape. \n\n \u201cSeverus?\u201d \n\n A little smile twisted Snape\u2019s mouth when she said his name. \n\n \u201cYeah?\u201d \n\n \u201cTell me about the dementors again.\u201d \n\n \u201cWhat d\u2019you want to know about them for?\u201d \n\n \u201cIf I use magic outside school \u2013 \u201d \n\n \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t give you to the dementors for that! Dementors are for people who \ndo really bad stuff. They guard the wizard prison, Azkaban. You\u2019re not going to end up \nin Azkaban, you\u2019re too \u2013 \u201d \n\n He turned red again and shredded more leaves. Then a small rustling noise behind \nHarry made him turn: Petunia, hiding behind a tree, had lost her footing. \n\n \u201cTuney!\u201d said Lily, surprise and welcome in her voice, but Snape had jumped to \nhis feet. \n\n \u201cWho\u2019s spying now?\u201d he shouted. \u201cWhat d\u2019you want?\u201d \n\n Petunia was breathless, alarmed at being caught. Harry could see her struggling \nfor something hurtful to say. \n\n \u201cWhat is that you\u2019re wearing, anyway?\u201d she said, pointing at Snape\u2019s chest. \n\u201cYour mum\u2019s blouse?\u201d \n\n There was a crack. A branch over Petunia\u2019s head had fallen. Lily screamed. The \nbranch caught Petunia on the shoulder, and she staggered backward and burst into tears. \n\n \u201cTuney!\u201d \n\n But Petunia was running away. Lily rounded on Snape. \n\n \u201cDid you make that happen?\u201d \n\n \u201cNo.\u201d He looked both defiant and scared. \n\n \u201cYou did!\u201d She was backing away from him. \u201cYou did! You hurt her!\u201d \n\n \u201cNo \u2013 no, I didn\u2019t!\u201d \n\n But the lie did not convince Lily. After one last burning look, she ran from the \nlittle thicket, off after her sister, and Snape looked miserable and confused\u2026 \n\n\f\n And the scene re-formed. Harry looked around. He was on platform nine and \nthree quarters, and Snape stood beside him, slightly hunched, next to a thin, sallow-faced, \nsour-looking woman who greatly resembled him. Snape was staring at a family of four a \nshort distance away. The two girls stood a little apart from their parents. Lily seemed to \nbe pleading with her sister. Harry moved closer to listen. \n\n \u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry, Tuney, I\u2019m sorry! Listen \u2013 \u201d She caught her sister\u2019s hand and held \ntight to it, even though Petunia tried to pull it away. \u201cMaybe once I\u2019m there \u2013 no, listen, \nTuney! Maybe once I\u2019m there, I\u2019ll be able to go to Professor Dumbledore and persuade \nhim to change his mind!\u201d \n\n \u201cI don\u2019t \u2013 want \u2013 to \u2013 go!\u201d said Petunia, and she dragged her hand back out of her \nsister\u2019s grasp. \u201cYou think I want to go to some stupid castle and learn to be a \u2013 a\u2026\u201d \n\n Her pale eyes roved over the platform, over the cats mewling in their owners\u2019 \narms, over the owls, fluttering and hooting at each other in cages, over the students, some \nalready in their long black robes, loading trunks onto the scarlet steam engine or else \ngreeting one another with glad cries after a summer apart. \n\n \u201c \u2013 you think I want to be a \u2013 a freak?\u201d \n\n Lily\u2019s eyes filled with tears as Petunia succeeded in tugging her hand away. \n\n \u201cI\u2019m not a freak,\u201d said Lily. \u201cThat\u2019s a horrible thing to say.\u201d \n\n \u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re going,\u201d said Petunia with relish. \u201cA special school for \nfreaks. You and that Snape boy\u2026weirdos, that\u2019s what you two are. It\u2019s good you\u2019re \nbeing separated from normal people. It\u2019s for our safety.\u201d \n\n Lily glanced toward her parents, who were looking around the platform with an \nair of wholehearted enjoyment, drinking in the scene. Then she looked back at her sister, \nand her voice was low and fierce. \n\n \u201cYou didn\u2019t think it was such a freak\u2019s school when you wrote to the headmaster \nand begged him to take you.\u201d \n\n Petunia turned scarlet. \n\n \u201cBeg? I didn\u2019t beg!\u201d \n\n \u201cI saw his reply. It was very kind.\u201d \n\n \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have read \u2013 \u201d whispered Petunia, \u201cthat was my private \u2013 how \ncould you \u2013 ?\u201d \n\n Lily gave herself away by half-glancing toward where Snape stood nearby. \nPetunia gasped. \n\n \u201cThat boy found it! You and that boy have been sneaking in my room!\u201d \n\n \u201cNo \u2013 not sneaking \u2013 \u201d Now Lily was on the defensive. \u201cSeverus saw the \nenvelope, and he couldn\u2019t believe a Muggle could have contacted Hogwarts, that\u2019s all! \nHe says there must be wizards working undercover in the postal service who take care of \n\u2013 \u201d \n\n \u201cApparently wizards poke their noses in everywhere!\u201d said Petunia, now as pale \nas she had been flushed. \u201cFreak!\u201d she spat at her sister, and she flounced off to where her \nparents stood\u2026 \n\n The scene dissolved again. Snape was hurrying along the corridor of the \nHogwarts Express as it clattered through the countryside. He had already changed into his \nschool robes, had perhaps taken the first opportunity to take off his dreadful Muggle \nclothes. At last he stopped, outside a compartment in which a group of rowdy boys were \n\n\f\ntalking. Hunched in a corner seat beside the window was Lily, her face pressed against \nthe windowpane. \n\n Snape slid open the compartment door and sat down opposite Lily. She glanced at \nhim and then looked back out of the window. She had been crying. \n\n \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to you,\u201d she said in a constricted voice. \n\n \u201cWhy not?\u201d \n\n \u201cTuney h-hates me. Because we saw that letter from Dumbledore.\u201d \n\n \u201cSo what?\u201d \n\n She threw him a look of deep dislike. \n\n \u201cSo she\u2019s my sister!\u201d \n\n \u201cShe\u2019s only a \u2013 \u201d He caught himself quickly; Lily, too busy trying to wipe her \neyes without being noticed, did not hear him. \n\n \u201cBut we\u2019re going!\u201d he said, unable to suppress the exhilaration in his voice. \u201cThis \nis it! We\u2019re off to Hogwarts!\u201d \n\n She nodded, mopping her eyes, but in spite of herself, she half smiled. \n\n \u201cYou\u2019d better be in Slytherin,\u201d said Snape, encouraged that she had brightened a \nlittle. \n\n \u201cSlytherin?\u201d \n\n One of the boys sharing the compartment, who had shown no interest at all in Lily \nor Snape until that point, looked around at the word, and Harry, whose attention had been \nfocused entirely on the two beside the window, saw his father: slight, black-haired like \nSnape, but with that indefinable air of having been well-cared-for, even adored, that \nSnape so conspicuously lacked. \n\n \u201cWho wants to be in Slytherin? I think I\u2019d leave, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d James asked the \nboy lounging on the seats opposite him, and with a jolt, Harry realized that it was Sirius. \nSirius did not smile. \n\n \u201cMy whole family have been in Slytherin,\u201d he said. \n\n \u201cBlimey,\u201d said James, \u201cand I thought you seemed all right!\u201d \n\n Sirius grinned. \n\n \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll break the tradition. Where are you heading, if you\u2019ve got the choice?\u201d \n\n James lifted an invisible sword. \n\n \u201c\u2018Gryffindor, where dwell the brave at heart!\u2019 Like my dad.\u201d \n\n Snape made a small, disparaging noise. James turned on him. \n\n \u201cGot a problem with that?\u201d \n\n \u201cNo,\u201d said Snape, though his slight sneer said otherwise. \u201cIf you\u2019d rather be \nbrawny than brainy \u2013 \u201d \n\n \u201cWhere\u2019re you hoping to go, seeing as you\u2019re neither?\u201d interjected Sirius. \n\n James roared with laughter. Lily sat up, rather flushed, and looked from James to \nSirius in dislike. \n\n \u201cCome on, Severus, let\u2019s find another compartment.\u201d \n\n \u201cOooooo\u2026\u201d \n\n James and Sirius imitated her lofty voice; James tried to trip Snape as he passed. \n\n \u201cSee ya, Snivellus!\u201d a voice called, as the compartment door slammed\u2026 \n\n And the scene dissolved once more\u2026 \n\n Harry was standing right behind Snape as they faced the candlelit House tables, \nlined with rapt faces. Then Professor McGonagall said, \u201cEvans, Lily!\u201d \n\n\f\n He watched his mother walk forward on trembling legs and sit down upon the \nrickety stool. Professor McGonagall dropped the Sorting Hat onto her head, and barely a \nsecond after it had touched the dark red hair, the hat cried, \u201cGryffindor!\u201d \n\n Harry heard Snape let out a tiny groan. Lily took off the hat, handed it back to \nProfessor McGonagall, then hurried toward the cheering Gryffindors, but as she went she \nglanced back at Snape, and there was a sad little smile on her face. Harry saw Sirius \nmove up the bench to make room for her. She took one look at him, seemed to recognize \nhim from the train, folded her arms, and firmly turned her back on him. \n\n The roll call continued. Harry watched Lupin, Pettigrew, and his father join Lily \nand Sirius at the Gryffindor table. At last, when only a dozen students remained to be \nsorted, Professor McGonagall called Snape. \n\n Harry walked with him to the stool, watched him place the hat upon his head. \n\u201cSlytherin!\u201d cried the Sorting Hat. \n\n And Severus Snape moved off to the other side of the Hall, away from Lily, to \nwhere the Slytherins were cheering him, to where Lucius Malfoy, a prefect badge \ngleaming upon his chest, patted Snape on the back as he sat down beside him\u2026 \n\n And the scene changed\u2026 \n\n Lily and Snape were walking across the castle courtyard, evidently arguing. Harry \nhurried to catch up with them, to listen in. As he reached them, he realized how much \ntaller they both were. A few years seemed to have passed since their Sorting. \n\n \u201c\u2026thought we were supposed to be friends?\u201d Snape was saying, \u201cBest friends?\u201d \n\n \u201cWe are, Sev, but I don\u2019t like some of the people you\u2019re hanging round with! I\u2019m \nsorry, but I detest Avery and Mulciber! Mulciber! What do you see in him, Sev, he\u2019s \ncreepy! D\u2019you know what he tried to do to Mary Macdonald the other day?\u201d \n\n Lily had reached a pillar and leaned against it, looking up into the thin, sallow \nface. \n\n \u201cThat was nothing,\u201d said Snape. \u201cIt was a laugh, that\u2019s all \u2013 \u201d \n\n \u201cIt was Dark Magic, and if you think that\u2019s funny \u2013 \u201d \n\n \u201cWhat about the stuff Potter and his mates get up to?\u201d demanded Snape. His color \nrose again as he said it, unable, it seemed, to hold in his resentment. \n\n \u201cWhat\u2019s Potter got to do with anything?\u201d said Lily. \n\n \u201cThey sneak out at night. There\u2019s something weird about that Lupin. Where does \nhe keep going?\u201d \n\n \u201cHe\u2019s ill,\u201d said Lily. \u201cThey say he\u2019s ill \u2013 \u201d \n\n \u201cEvery month at the full moon?\u201d said Snape. \n\n \u201cI know your theory,\u201d said Lily, and she sounded cold. \u201cWhy are you so obsessed \nwith them anyway? Why do you care what they\u2019re doing at night?\u201d \n\n \u201cI\u2019m just trying to show you they\u2019re not as wonderful as everyone seems to think \nthey are.\u201d \n\n The intensity of his gaze made her blush. \n\n \u201cThey don\u2019t use Dark Magic, though.\u201d She dropped her voice. \u201cAnd you\u2019re being \nreally ungrateful. I heard what happened the other night. You went sneaking down that \ntunnel by the Whomping Willow, and James Potter saved you from whatever\u2019s down \nthere \u2013 \u201d \n\n\f\n Snape\u2019s whole face contorted and he spluttered, \u201cSaved? Saved? You think he \nwas playing the hero? He was saving his neck and his friends\u2019 too! You\u2019re not going to \u2013 \nI won\u2019t let you \u2013 \u201d \n\n \u201cLet me? Let me?\u201d \n\n Lily\u2019s bright green eyes were slits. Snape backtracked at once. \n\n \u201cI didn\u2019t m ean \u2013 I just don\u2019t want to see you made a fool of \u2013 He fancies you, \nJames Potter fancies you!\u201d The words seemed wrenched from him against his will. \u201cAnd \nhe\u2019s not\u2026everyone thinks\u2026big Quidditch hero \u2013 \u201d Snape\u2019s bitterness and dislike were \nrendering him incoherent, and Lily\u2019s eyebrows were traveling farther and farther up her \nforehead. \n\n \u201cI know James Potter\u2019s an arrogant toerag,\u201d she said, cutting across Snape. \u201cI \ndon\u2019t need you to tell me that. But Mulciber\u2019s and Avery\u2019s idea of humor is just evil. Evil, \nSev. I don\u2019t understand how you can be friends with them.\u201d \n\n Harry doubted that Snape had even heard her strictures on Mulciber and Avery. \nThe moment she had insulted James Potter, his whole body had relaxed, and as they \nwalked away there was a new spring in Snape\u2019s step\u2026 \n\n And the scene dissolved\u2026 \n\n Harry watched again as Snape left the Great Hall after sitting his O.W.L. in \nDefense Against the Dark Arts, watched as he wandered away from the castle and strayed \ninadvertently close to the place beneath the beech tree where James, Sirius, Lupin, and \nPettigrew sat together. But Harry kept his distance this time, because he knew what \nhappened after James had hoisted Severus into the air and taunted him; he knew what had \nbeen done and said, and it gave him no pleasure to hear it again\u2026 He watched as Lily \njoined the group and went to Snape\u2019s defense. Distantly he heard Snape shout at her in \nhis humiliation and his fury, the unforgivable word: \u201cMudblood.\u201d \n\n The scene changed\u2026 \n\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d \n\n \u201cI\u2019m not interested.\u201d \n\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d \n\n \u201cSave your breath\u201d \n\n It was nighttime. Lily, who was wearing a dressing gown, stood with her arms \nfolded in front of the portrait of the Fat Lady, at the entrance to Gryffindor Tower. \n\n \u201cI only came out because Mary told me you were threatening to sleep here.\u201d \n\n \u201cI was. I would have done. I never meant to call you Mudblood, it just \u2013 \u201d \n\n \u201cSlipped out?\u201d There was no pity in Lily\u2019s voice. \u201cIt\u2019s too late. I\u2019ve made excuses \nfor you for years. None of my friends can understand why I even talk to you. You and \nyour precious little Death Eater friends \u2013 you see, you don\u2019t even deny it! You don\u2019t even \ndeny that\u2019s what you\u2019re all aiming to be! You can\u2019t wait to join You-Know-Who, can \nyou?\u201d \n\n He opened his mouth, but closed it without speaking. \n\n \u201cI can\u2019t pretend anymore. You\u2019ve chosen your way, I\u2019ve chosen mine.\u201d \n\n \u201cNo \u2013 listen, I didn\u2019t mean \u2013 \u201d \n\n \u201c \u2013 to call me Mudblood? But you call everyone of my birth Mudblood, Severus. \nWhy should I be any different?\u201d \n\n He struggled on the verge of speech, but with a contemptuous look she turned and \nclimbed back through the portrait hole\u2026 \n\n\f\n The corridor dissolved, and the scene took a little longer to reform: Harry seemed \nto fly through shifting shapes and colors until his surroundings solidified again and he \nstood on a hilltop, forlorn and cold in the darkness, the wind whistling through the \nbranches of a few leafless trees. The adult Snape was panting, turning on the spot, his \nwand gripped tightly in his hand, waiting for something or for someone\u2026 His fear \ninfected Harry too, even though he knew that he could not be harmed, and he looked over \nhis shoulder, wondering what it was that Snape was waiting for \u2013 \n\n Then a blinding, jagged jet of white light flew through the air. Harry thought of \nlightning, but Snape had dropped to his knees and his wand had flown out of his hand. \n\n \u201cDon\u2019t kill me!\u201d \n\n \u201cThat was not my intention.\u201d \n\n Any sound of Dumbledore Apparating had been drowned by the sound of the \nwind in the branches. He stood before Snape with his robes whipping around him, and his \nface was illuminated from below in the light cast by his wand. \n\n \u201cWell, Severus? What message does Lord Voldemort have for me?\u201d \n\n \u201cNo \u2013 no message \u2013 I\u2019m here on my own account!\u201d \n\n Snape was wringing his hands. He looked a little mad, with his straggling black \nhair flying around him. \n\n \u201cI \u2013 I come with a warning \u2013 no, a request \u2013 please \u2013 \u201d \n\n Dumbledore flicked his wand. Though leaves and branches still flew through the \nnight air around them, silence fell on the spot where he and Snape faced each other. \n\n \u201cWhat request could a Death Eater make of me?\u201d \n\n \u201cThe \u2013 the prophecy\u2026the prediction\u2026Trelawney\u2026\u201d \n\n \u201cAh, yes,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cHow much did you relay to Lord Voldemort?\u201d \n\n \u201cEverything \u2013 everything I heard!\u201d said Snape. \u201cThat is why \u2013 it is for that reason \n\u2013 he thinks it means Lily Evans!\u201d \n\n \u201cThe prophecy did not refer to a woman,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cIt spoke of a boy \nborn at the end of July \u2013 \u201d \n\n \u201cYou know what I mean! He thinks it means her son, he is going to hunt her down \n\u2013 kill them all \u2013 \u201d \n\n \u201cIf she means so much to you,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201csurely Lord Voldemort will \nspare her? Could you not ask for mercy for the mother, in exchange for the son?\u201d \n\n \u201cI have \u2013 I have asked him \u2013 \u201d \n\n \u201cYou disgust me,\u201d said Dumbledore, and Harry had never heard so much \ncontempt in his voice. Snape seemed to shrink a little, \u201cYou do not care, then, about the \ndeaths of her husband and child? They can die, as long as you have what you want?\u201d \n\n Snape said nothing, but merely looked up at Dumbledore. \n\n \u201cHide them all, then,\u201d he croaked. \u201cKeep her \u2013 them \u2013 safe. Please.\u201d \n\n \u201cAnd what will you give me in return, Severus?\u201d \n\n \u201cIn \u2013 in return?\u201d Snape gaped at Dumbledore, and Harry expected him to protest, \nbut after a long moment he said, \u201cAnything.\u201d \n\n The hilltop faded, and Harry stood in Dumbledore\u2019s office, and something was \nmaking a terrible sound, like a wounded animal. Snape was slumped forward in a chair \nand Dumbledore was standing over him, looking grim. After a moment or two, Snape \nraised his face, and he looked like a man who had lived a hundred years of misery since \nleaving the wild hilltop. \n\n\f\n \u201cI thought\u2026you were going\u2026to keep her\u2026safe\u2026\u201d \n\n \u201cShe and James put their faith in the wrong person,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cRather \nlike you, Severus. Weren\u2019t you hoping that Lord Voldemort would spare her?\u201d \n\n Snape\u2019s breathing was shallow. \n\n \u201cHer boy survives,\u201d said Dumbledore. \n\n With a tiny jerk of the head, Snape seemed to flick off an irksome fly. \n\n \u201cHer son lives. He has her eyes, precisely her eyes. You remember the shape and \ncolor of Lily Evans\u2019s eyes, I am sure?\u201d \n\n \u201cDON\u2019T!\u201d bellowed Snape. \u201cGone\u2026dead\u2026\u201d \n\n \u201cIs this remorse, Severus?\u201d \n\n \u201cI wish\u2026I wish I were dead\u2026\u201d \n\n \u201cAnd what use would that be to anyone?\u201d said Dumbledore coldly. \u201cIf you loved \nLily Evans, if you truly loved her, then your way forward is clear.\u201d \n\n Snape seemed to peer through a haze of pain, and Dumbledore\u2019s words appeared \nto take a long time to reach him. \n\n \u201cWhat \u2013 what do you mean?\u201d \n\n \u201cYou know how and why she died. Make sure it was not in vain. Help me protect \nLily\u2019s son.\u201d \n\n \u201cHe does not need protection. The Dark Lord has gone \u2013 \u201d \n\n \u201cThe Dark Lord will return, and Harry Potter will be in terrible danger when he \ndoes.\u201d \n\n There was a long pause, and slowly Snape regained control of himself, mastered \nhis own breathing. At last he said, \u201cVery well. Very well. But never \u2013 never tell, \nDumbledore! This must be between us! Swear it! I cannot bear\u2026especially Potter\u2019s \nson\u2026I want your word!\u201d \n\n \u201cMy word, Severus, that I shall never reveal the best of you?\u201d Dumbledore sighed, \nlooking down into Snape\u2019s ferocious, anguished face. \u201cIf you insist\u2026\u201d \n\n The office dissolved but re-formed instantly. Snape was pacing up and down in \nfront of Dumbledore. \n\n \u201c \u2013 mediocre, arrogant as his father, a determined rule-breaker, delighted to find \nhimself famous, attention-seeking and impertinent \u2013 \u201d \n\n \u201cYou see what you expect to see, Severus,\u201d said Dumbledore, without raising his \neyes from a copy of Transfiguration Today. \u201cOther teachers report that the boy is modest, \nlikable, and reasonably talented. Personally, I find him an engaging child.\u201d \n\n Dumbledore turned a page, and said, without looking up, \u201cKeep an eye on \nQuirrell, won\u2019t you?\u201d \n\n A whirl of color, and now everything darkened, and Snape and Dumbledore stood \na little apart in the entrance hall, while the last stragglers from the Yule Ball passed them \non their way to bed. \n\n \u201cWell?\u201d murmured Dumbledore. \n\n \u201cKarkaroff\u2019s Mark is becoming darker too. He is panicking, he fears retribution; \nyou know how much help he gave the Ministry after the Dark Lord fell.\u201d Snape looked \nsideways at Dumbledore\u2019s crooked-nosed profile. \u201cKarkaroff intends to flee if the Mark \nburns.\u201d \n\n \u201cDoes he?\u201d said Dumbledore softly, as Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies came \ngiggling in from the grounds. \u201cAnd are you tempted to join him?\u201d \n\n\f\n \u201cNo,\u201d said Snape, his black eyes on Fleur\u2019s and Roger\u2019s retreating figures. \u201cI am \nnot such a coward.\u201d \n\n \u201cNo,\u201d agreed Dumbledore. \u201cYou are a braver man by far than Igor Karkaroff. \nYou know, I sometimes think we Sort too soon\u2026\u201d \n\n He walked away, leaving Snape looking stricken\u2026 \n\n And now Harry stood in the headmaster\u2019s office yet again. It was nighttime, and \nDumbledore sagged sideways in the thronelike chair behind the desk, apparently \nsemiconscious. His right hand dangled over the side, blackened and burned. Snape was \nmuttering incantations, pointing his wand at the wrist of the hand, while with his left \nhand he tipped a goblet full of thick golden potion down Dumbledore\u2019s throat. After a \nmoment or two, Dumbledore\u2019s eyelids fluttered and opened. \n\n \u201cWhy,\u201d said Snape, without preamble, \u201cwhy did you put on that ring? It carries a \ncurse, surely you realized that. Why even touch it?\u201d \n\n Marvolo Gaunt\u2019s ring lay on the desk before Dumbledore. It was cracked; the \nsword of Gryffindor lay beside it. \n\n Dumbledore grimaced. \n\n \u201cI\u2026was a fool. Sorely tempted\u2026\u201d \n\n \u201cTempted by what?\u201d \n\n Dumbledore did not answer. \n\n \u201cIt is a miracle you managed to return here!\u201d Snape sounded furious. \u201cThat ring \ncarried a curse of extraordinary power, to contain it is all we can hope for; I have trapped \nthe curse in one hand for the time being \u2013 \u201d \n\n Dumbledore raised his blackened, useless hand, and examined it with the \nexpression of one being shown an interesting curio. \n\n \u201cYou have done very well, Severus. How long do you think I have?\u201d \n\n Dumbledore\u2019s tone was conversational; he might have been asking for a weather \nforecast. Snape hesitated, and then said, \u201cI cannot tell. Maybe a year. There is no halting \nsuch a spell forever. It will spread eventually, it is the sort of curse that strengthens over \ntime.\u201d \n\n Dumbledore smiled. The news that he had less than a year to live seemed a matter \nof little or no concern to him. \n\n \u201cI am fortunate, extremely fortunate, that I have you, Severus.\u201d \n\n \u201cIf you had only summoned me a little earlier, I might have been able to do more, \nbuy you more time!\u201d said Snape furiously. He looked down at the broken ring and the \nsword. \u201cDid you think that breaking the ring would break the curse?\u201d \n\n \u201cSomething like that\u2026I was delirious, no doubt\u2026\u201d said Dumbledore. With an \neffort he straightened himself in his chair. \u201cWell, really, this makes matters much more \nstraightforward.\u201d \n\n Snape looked utterly perplexed. Dumbledore smiled. \n\n \u201cI refer to the plan Lord Voldemort is revolving around me. His plan to have the \npoor Malfoy boy murder me.\u201d \n\n Snape sat down in the chair Harry had so often occupied, across the desk from \nDumbledore. Harry could tell that he wanted to say more on the subject of Dumbledore\u2019s \ncursed hand, but the other held it up in polite refusal to discuss the matter further. \nScowling, Snape said, \u201cThe Dark Lord does not expect Draco to succeed. This is merely \n\n\f\npunishment for Lucius\u2019s recent failures. Slow torture for Draco\u2019s parents, while they \nwatch him fail and pay the price.\u201d \n\n \u201cIn short, the boy has had a death sentence pronounced upon him as surely as I \nhave,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cNow, I should have thought the natural successor to the job, \nonce Draco fails, is yourself?\u201d \n\n There was a short pause. \n\n \u201cThat, I think, is the Dark Lord\u2019s plan.\u201d \n\n \u201cLord Voldemort foresees a moment in the near future when he will not need a \nspy at Hogwarts?\u201d \n\n \u201cHe believes the school will soon be in his grasp, yes.\u201d \n\n \u201cAnd if it does fall into his grasp,\u201d said Dumbledore, almost, it seemed, as an \naside, \u201cI have your word that you will do all in your power to protect the students at \nHogwarts?\u201d \n\n Snape gave a stiff nod. \n\n \u201cGood. Now then. Your first priority will be to discover what Draco is up to. A \nfrightened teenage boy is a danger to others as well as to himself. Offer him help and \nguidance, he ought to accept, he likes you \u2013 \u201d \n\n \u201c \u2013 much less since his father has lost favor. Draco blames me, he thinks I have \nusurped Lucius\u2019s position.\u201d \n\n \u201cAll the same, try. I am concerned less for myself than for accidental victims of \nwhatever schemes might occur to the boy. Ultimately, of course, there is only one thing \nto be done if we are to save him from Lord Voldemort\u2019s wrath.\u201d \n\n Snape raised his eyebrows and his tone was sardonic as he asked, \u201cAre you \nintending to let him kill you?\u201d \n\n \u201cCertainly not. You must kill me.\u201d \n\n There was a long silence, broken only by an odd clicking noise. Fawkes the \nphoenix was gnawing a bit of cuttlebone. \n\n \u201cWould you like me to do it now?\u201d asked Snape, his voice heavy with irony. \u201cOr \nwould you like a few moments to compose an epitaph?\u201d \n\n \u201cOh, not quite yet,\u201d said Dumbledore, smiling. \u201cI daresay the moment will present \nitself in due course. Given what has happened tonight,\u201d he indicated his withered hand, \n\u201cwe can be sure that it will happen within a year.\u201d \n\n \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind dying,\u201d said Snape roughly, \u201cwhy not let Draco do it?\u201d \n\n \u201cThat boy\u2019s soul is not yet so damaged,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cI would not have it \nripped apart on my account.\u201d \n\n \u201cAnd my soul, Dumbledore? Mine?\u201d \n\n \u201cYou alone know whether it will harm your soul to help an old man avoid pain \nand humiliation,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cI ask this one great favor of you, Severus, because \ndeath is coming for me as surely as the Chudley Cannons will finish bottom of this year\u2019s \nleague. I confess I should prefer a quick, painless exit to the protracted and messy affair it \nwill be if, for instance, Greyback is involved \u2013 I hear Voldemort has recruited him? Or \ndear Bellatrix, who likes to play with her food before she eats it.\u201d \n\n His tone was light, but his blue eyes pierced Snape as they had frequently pierced \nHarry, as though the soul they discussed was visible to him. At last Snape gave another \ncurt nod. \n\n Dumbledore seemed satisfied. \n\n\f\n \u201cThank you, Severus\u2026\u201d \n\n The office disappeared, and now Snape and Dumbledore were strolling together \nin the deserted castle grounds by twilight. \n\n \u201cWhat are you doing with Potter, all these evenings you are closeted together?\u201d \nSnape asked abruptly. \n\n Dumbledore looked weary. \n\n \u201cWhy? You aren\u2019t trying to give him more detentions, Severus? The boy will \nsoon have spent more time in detention than out.\u201d \n\n \u201cHe is his father over again \u2013 \u201d \n\n \u201cIn looks, perhaps, but his deepest nature is much more like his mother\u2019s. I spend \ntime with Harry because I have things to discuss with him, information I must give him \nbefore it is too late.\u201d \n\n \u201cInformation,\u201d repeated Snape. \u201cYou trust him\u2026you do not trust me.\u201d \n\n \u201cIt is not a question of trust. I have, as we both know, limited time. It is essential \nthat I give the boy enough information for him to do what he needs to do.\u201d \n\n \u201cAnd why may I not have the same information?\u201d \n\n \u201cI prefer not to put all of my secrets in one basket, particularly not a basket that \nspends so much time dangling on the arm of Lord Voldemort.\u201d \n\n \u201cWhich I do on your orders!\u201d \n\n \u201cAnd you do it extremely well. Do not think that I underestimate the constant \ndanger in which you place yourself, Severus. To give Voldemort what appears to be \nvaluable information while withholding the essentials is a job I would entrust to nobody \nbut you.\u201d \n\n \u201cYet you confide much more in a boy who is incapable of Occlumency, whose \nmagic is mediocre, and who has a direct connection into the Dark Lord\u2019s mind!\u201d \n\n \u201cVoldemort fears that connection,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cNot so long ago he had \none small taste of what truly sharing Harry\u2019s mind means to him. It was pain such as he \nhas never experienced. He will not try to possess Harry again, I am sure of it. Not in that \nway.\u201d \n\n \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d \n\n \u201cLord Voldemort\u2019s soul, maimed as it is, cannot bear close contact with a soul \nlike Harry\u2019s. Like a tongue on frozen steel, like flesh in flame \u2013 \u201d \n\n \u201cSouls? We were talking of minds!\u201d \n\n \u201cIn the case of Harry and Lord Voldemort, to speak of one is to speak of the \nother.\u201d \n\n Dumbledore glanced around to make sure that they were alone. They were close \nby the Forbidden Forest now, but there was no sign of anyone near them. \n\n \u201cAfter you have killed me, Severus \u2013 \u201d \n\n \u201cYou refuse to tell me everything, yet you expect that small service of me!\u201d \nsnarled Snape, and real anger flared in the thin face now. \u201cYou take a great deal for \ngranted, Dumbledore! Perhaps I have changed my mind!\u201d \n\n \u201cYou gave me your word, Severus. And while we are talking about services you \nowe me, I thought you agreed to keep a close eye on our young Slytherin friend?\u201d \n\n Snape looked angry, mutinous. Dumbledore sighed. \n\n \u201cCome to my office tonight, Severus, at eleven, and you shall not complain that I \nhave no confidence in you\u2026\u201d \n\n\f\n They were back in Dumbledore\u2019s office, the windows dark, and Fawkes sat silent \nas Snape sat quite still, as Dumbledore walked around him, talking. \n\n \u201cHarry must not know, not until the last moment, not until it is necessary, \notherwise how could he have the strength to do what must be done?\u201d \n\n \u201cBut what must he do?\u201d \n\n \u201cThat is between Harry and me. Now listen closely, Severus. There will come a \ntime \u2013 after my death \u2013 do not argue, do not interrupt! There will come a time when Lord \nVoldemort will seem to fear for the life of his snake.\u201d \n\n \u201cFor Nagini?\u201d Snape looked astonished. \n\n \u201cPrecisely. If there comes a time when Lord Voldemort stops sending that snake \nforth to do his bidding, but keeps it safe beside him under magical protection, then, I \nthink, it will be safe to tell Harry.\u201d \n\n \u201cTell him what?\u201d \n\n Dumbledore took a deep breath and closed his eyes. \n\n \u201cTell him that on the night Lord Voldemort tried to kill him, when Lily cast her \nown life between them as a shield, the Killing Curse rebounded upon Lord Voldemort, \nand a fragment of Voldemort\u2019s soul was blasted apart from the whole, and latched itself \nonto the only living soul left in that collapsed building. Part of Lord Voldemort lives \ninside Harry, and it is that which gives him the power of speech with snakes, and a \nconnection with Lord Voldemort\u2019s mind that he has never understood. And while that \nfragment of soul, unmissed by Voldemort, remains attached to and protected by Harry, \nLord Voldemort cannot die.\u201d \n\n Harry seemed to be watching the two men from one end of a long tunnel, they \nwere so far away from him, their voices echoing strangely in his ears. \n\n \u201cSo the boy\u2026the boy must die?\u201d asked Snape quite calmly. \n\n \u201cAnd Voldemort himself must do it, Severus. That is essential.\u201d \n\n Another long silence. Then Snape said, \u201cI thought\u2026all those years\u2026that we were \nprotecting him for her. For Lily.\u201d \n\n \u201cWe have protected him because it has been essential to teach him, to raise him, \nto let him try his strength,\u201d said Dumbledore, his eyes still tight shut. \u201cMeanwhile, the \nconnection between them grows ever stronger, a parasitic growth. Sometimes I have \nthought he suspects it himself. If I know him, he will have arranged matters so that when \nhe does set out to meet his death, it will truly mean the end of Voldemort.\u201d \n\n Dumbledore opened his eyes. Snape looked horrified. \n\n \u201cYou have kept him alive so that he can die at the right moment?\u201d \n\n \u201cDon\u2019t be shocked, Severus. How many men and women have you watched die?\u201d \n\n \u201cLately, only those whom I could not save,\u201d said Snape. He stood up. \u201cYou have \nused me.\u201d \n\n \u201cMeaning?\u201d \n\n \u201cI have spied for you and lied for you, put myself in mortal danger for you. \nEverything was supposed to be to keep Lily Potter\u2019s son safe. Now you tell me you have \nbeen raising him like a pig for slaughter \u2013 \u201d \n\n \u201cBut this is touching, Severus,\u201d said Dumbledore seriously. \u201cHave you grown to \ncare for the boy, after all?\u201d \n\n \u201cFor him?\u201d shouted Snape. \u201cExpecto Patronum!\u201d \n\n\f\n From the tip of his wand burst the silver doe. She landed on the office floor, \nbounded once across the office, and soared out of the window. Dumbledore watched her \nfly away, and as her silvery glow faded he turned back to Snape, and his eyes were full of \ntears. \n\n \u201cAfter all this time?\u201d \n\n \u201cAlways,\u201d said Snape. \n\n And the scene shifted. Now, Harry saw Snape talking to the portrait of \nDumbledore behind his desk. \n\n \u201cYou will have to give Voldemort the correct date of Harry\u2019s departure from his \naunt and uncle\u2019s,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cNot to do so will raise suspicion, when Voldemort \nbelieves you so well informed. However, you must plant the idea of decoys; that, I think, \nought to ensure Harry\u2019s safety. Try Confunding Mundungus Fletcher. And Severus, if \nyou are forced to take part in the chase, be sure to act your part convincingly\u2026I am \ncounting upon you to remain in Lord Voldemort\u2019s good books as long as possible, or \nHogwarts will be left to the mercy of the Carrows\u2026\u201d \n\n Now Snape was head to head with Mundungus in an unfamiliar tavern, \nMundungus\u2019s face looking curiously blank, Snape frowning in concentration. \n\n \u201cYou will suggest to the Order of the Phoenix,\u201d Snape murmured, \u201cthat they use \ndecoys. Polyjuice Potion. Identical Potters. It\u2019s the only thing that might work. You will \nforget that I have suggested this. You will present it as your own idea. You understand?\u201d \n\n \u201cI understand,\u201d murmured Mundungus, his eyes unfocused\u2026 \n\n Now Harry was flying alongside Snape on a broomstick through a clear dark \nnight: He was accompanied by other hodded Death Eaters, and ahead were Lupin and a \nHarry who was really George\u2026 A Death Eater moved ahead of Snape and raised his \nwand, pointing it directly at Lupin\u2019s back. \n\n \u201cSectumsempra!\u201d shouted Snape. \n\n But the spell, intended for the Death Eater\u2019s wand hand, missed and hit George \ninstead \u2013 \n\n And next, Snape was kneeling in Sirius\u2019s old bedroom. Tears were dripping from \nthe end of his hooked nose as he read the old letter from Lily. The second page carried \nonly a few words: \n\n \n\ncould ever have been friends with Gellert Grindelwald. I think her mind\u2019s going, \npersonally! \n\n \n\n Lots of love, \n\n Lily \n\n \n\n Snape took the page bearing Lily\u2019s signature, and her love, and tucked it inside \nhis robes. Then he ripped in two the photograph he was also holding, so that he kept the \npart from which Lily laughed, throwing the portion showing James and Harry back onto \nthe floor, under the chest of drawers\u2026 \n\n And now Snape stood again in the headmaster\u2019s study as Phineas Nigellus came \nhurrying into his portrait. \n\n \u201cHeadmaster! They are camping in the Forest of Dean! The Mudblood \u2013 \u201d \n\n \u201cDo not use that word!\u201d \n\n\f\n \u201c \u2013 the Granger girl, then, mentioned the place as she opened her bag and I heard \nher!\u201d \n\n \u201cGood. Very good!\u201d cried the portrait of Dumbledore behind the headmaster\u2019s \nchair. \u201cNow, Severus, the sword! Do not forget that it must be taken under conditions of \nneed and valor \u2013 and he must not know that you give it! If Voldemort should read \nHarry\u2019s mind and see you acting for him \u2013 \u201d \n\n \u201cI know,\u201d said Snape curtly. He approached the portrait of Dumbledore and \npulled at its side. It swung forward, revealing a hidden cavity behind it from which he \ntook the sword of Gryffindor. \n\n \u201cAnd you still aren\u2019t going to tell me why it\u2019s so important to give Potter the \nsword?\u201d said Snape as he swung a traveling cloak over his robes. \n\n \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d said Dumbledore\u2019s portrait. \u201cHe will know what to do with \nit. And Severus, be very careful, they may not take kindly to your appearance after \nGeorge Weasley\u2019s mishap \u2013 \u201d \n\n Snape turned at the door. \n\n \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Dumbledore,\u201d he said coolly. \u201cI have a plan\u2026\u201d \n\n And Snape left the room. Harry rose up out of the Pensieve, and moments later he \nlay on the carpeted floor in exactly the same rooms Snape might just have closed the door. \n\n \n\nChapter Thirty-Four \n\nThe Forest Again \n\n \n\nFinally, the truth. Lying with his face pressed into the dusty carpet of the office \nwhere he had once thought he was learning the secrets of victory, Harry understood at \nlast that he was not supposed to survive. His job was to walk calmly into Death\u2019s \nwelcoming arms. Along the way, he was to dispose of Voldemort\u2019s remaining links to \nlife, so that when at last he flung himself across Voldemort\u2019s path, and did not raise a \nwand to defend himself, the end would be clean, and the job that ought to have been done \nin Godric\u2019s Hollow would be finished. Neither would live, neither could survive. \n\n He felt his heart pounding fiercely in his chest. How strange that in his dread of \ndeath, it pumped all the harder, valiantly keeping him alive. But it would have to stop, \nand soon. Its beats were numbered. How many would there be time for, as he rose and \nwalked through the castle for the last time, out into the grounds and into the forest? \n\n Terror washed over him as he lay on the floor, with that funeral drum pounding \ninside him. Would it hurt to die? All those times he had thought that it was about to \nhappen and escaped, he had never really thought of the thing itself: His will to live had \nalways been so much stronger than his fear of death. Yet it did not occur to him now to \ntry to escape, to outrun Voldemort. It was over, he knew it, and all that was left was the \nthing itself: dying. \n\n If he could only have died on that summer\u2019s night when he had left number four, \nPrivet Drive, for the last time, when the noble phoenix feather wand had saved him! If he \ncould only have died like Hedwig, so quickly he would not have known it had happened! \nOr if he could have launched himself in front of a wand to save someone he loved . . . He \nenvied even his parents\u2019 deaths now. This cold-blooded walk to his own destruction \n\n\f\nwould require a different kind of bravery. He felt his fingers trembling slightly and made \nan effort to control them, although no one could see him; the portraits on the walls were \nall empty. \n\n Slowly, very slowly, he sat up, and as he did so he felt more alive and more aware \nof his own living body than ever before. Why had he never appreciated what a miracle he \nwas, brain and nerve and bounding heart? It would all be gone . . . or at least, he would be \ngone from it. His breath came slow and deep, and his mouth and throat were completely \ndry, but so were his eyes. \n\n Dumbledore\u2019s betrayal was almost nothing. Of course there had been a bigger \nplan: Harry had simply been too foolish to see it, he realized that now. He had never \nquestioned his own assumption that Dumbledore wanted him alive. Now he saw that his \nlife span had always been determined by how long it took to eliminate all the Horcruxes. \nDumbledore had passed the job of destroying them to him, and obediently he had \ncontinued to chip away at the bonds tying not only Voldemort, but himself, to life! How \nneat, how elegant, not to waste any more lives, but to give the dangerous task to the boy \nwho had already been marked for slaughter, and whose death would not be a calamity, \nbut another blow against Voldemort. \n\n And Dumbledore had known that Harry would not duck out, that he would keep \ngoing to the end, even though it was his end, because he had taken trouble to get to know \nhim, hadn\u2019t he? Dumbledore knew, as Voldemort knew, that Harry would not let anyone \nelse die for him now that he had discovered it was in his power to stop it. The images of \nFred, Lupin, and Tonks lying dead in the Great Hall forced their way back into his mind\u2019s \neye, and for a moment he could hardly breathe. Death was impatient . . . \n\n But Dumbledore had overestimated him. He had failed: The snake survived. One \nHorcrux remained to bind Voldemort to the earth, even after Harry had been killed. True, \nthat would mean an easier job for somebody. He wondered who would do it . . . Ron and \nHermione would know what needed to be done, of course . . . That would have been why \nDumbledore wanted him to confide in two others . . . so that if he fulfilled his true destiny \na little early, they could carry on . . . \n\n Like rain on a cold window, these thoughts pattered against the hard surface of \nthe incontrovertible truth, which was that he must die. I must die. It must end. \n\n Ron and Hermione seemed a long way away, in a far-off country; he felt as \nthough he had parted from them long ago. There would be no good-byes and no \nexplanations, he was determined of that. This was a journey they could not take together, \nand the attempts they would make to stop him would waste valuable time. He looked \ndown at the battered gold watch he had received on his seventeenth birthday. Nearly half \nof the hour allotted by Voldemort for his surrender had elapsed. \n\n He stood up. His heart was leaping against his ribs like a frantic bird. Perhaps it \nknew it had little time left, perhaps it was determined to fulfill a lifetime\u2019s beats before \nthe end. He did not look back as he closed the office door. \n\n The castle was empty. He felt ghostly striding through it alone, as if he had \nalready died. The portrait people were still missing from their frames; the whole place \nwas eerily still, as if all its remaining lifeblood were concentrated in the Great Hall where \nthe dead and the mourners were crammed. \n\n Harry pulled the Invisibility Cloak over himself and descended through the floors, \nat last walking down the marble staircase into the entrance hall. Perhaps some tiny part of \n\n\f\nhim hoped to be sensed, to be seen, to be stopped, but the Cloak was, as ever, \nimpenetrable, perfect, and he reached the front doors easily. \n\n Then Neville nearly walked into him. He was one half of a pair that was carrying \na body in from the grounds. Harry glanced down and felt another dull blow to his \nstomach: Colon Creevey, though underage, must have sneaked back just as Malfoy, \nCrabbe, and Goyle had done. He was tiny in death. \n\n \u201cYou know what? I can manage him alone, Neville,\u201d said Oliver Wood, and he \nheaved Colin over his shoulder in a fireman\u2019s lift and carried him into the Great Hall. \n\n Neville leaned against the door frame for a moment and wiped his forehead with \nthe back of his hand. He looked like an old man. Then he set off on the steps again into \nthe darkness to recover more bodies. \n\n Harry took one glance back at the entrance of the Great Hall. People were moving \naround, trying to comfort each other, drinking, kneeling beside the dead, but he could not \nsee any of the people he loved, no hint of Hermione, Ron, Ginny, or any of the other \nWeasleys, no Luna. He felt he would have given all the time remaining to him for just \none last look at them; but then, would he ever have the strength to stop looking? It was \nbetter like this. \n\n He moved down the steps and out into the darkness. It was nearly four in the \nmorning, and the deathly stillness of the grounds felt as though they were holding their \nbreath, waiting to see whether he could do what he must. \n\n Harry moved toward Neville, who was bending over another body. \n\n \u201cNeville.\u201d \n\n \u201cBlimey, Harry, you nearly gave me heart failure!\u201d \n\n Harry had pulled off the Cloak: The idea had come to him out of nowhere, born \nout of a desire to make absolutely sure. \n\n \u201cWhere are you going, alone?\u201d Neville asked suspiciously. \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s all part of the plan,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThere\u2019s someting I\u2019ve got to do. Listen --- \nNeville ---\u201c \n\n \u201cHarry!\u201d Neville looked suddenly scared. \u201cHarry, you\u2019re not thinking of handing \nyourself over?\u201d \n\n \u201cNo,\u201d Harry lied easily. \u201c\u2019Course not . . . this is something else. But I might be \nout of sight for a while. You know Voldemort\u2019s snake. Neville? He\u2019s got a huge snake . . . \nCalls it Nagini . . .\u201d \n\n \u201cI\u2019ve heard, yeah . . . What about it?\u201d \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s got to be killed. Ron and Hermione know that, but just in case they ---\u201c \n\n The awfulness of that possibility smothered him for a moment, made it impossible \nto keep talking. But he pulled himself together again: This was crucial, he must be like \nDumbledore, keep a cool head, make sure there were backups, others to carry on. \nDumbledore had died knowing that three people still knew about the Horcruxes; now \nNeville would take Harry\u2019s place: There would still be three in the secret. \n\n \u201cJust in case they\u2019re --- busy --- and you get the chance ---\u201c \n\n \u201cKill the snake?\u201d \n\n \u201cKill the snake,\u201d Harry repeated. \n\n \u201cAll right, Harry. You\u2019re okay, are you?\u201d \n\n \u201cI\u2019m fine. Thanks, Neville.\u201d \n\n But Neville seized his wrist as Harry made to move on. \n\n\f\n \u201cWe\u2019re all going to keep fighting, Harry. You know that?\u201d \n\n \u201cYeah, I ---\u201c \n\n The suffocating feeling extinguished the end of the sentence; he could not go on. \nNeville did not seem to find it strange. He patted Harry on the shoulder, released him, \nand walked away to look for more bodies. \n\n Harry swung the Cloak back over himself and walked on. Someone else was \nmoving not far away, stooping over another prone figure on the ground. He was feet \naway from her when he realized it was Ginny. \n\n He stopped in his tracks. She was crouching over a girl who was whispering for \nher mother. \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Ginny was saying. \u201cIt\u2019s ok. We\u2019re going to get you inside.\u201d \n\n \u201cBut I want to go home,\u201d whispered the girl. \u201cI don\u2019t want to fight anymore!\u201d \n\n \u201cI know,\u201d said Ginny, and her voice broke. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be all right.\u201d \n\n Ripples of cold undulated over Harry\u2019s skin. He wanted to shout out to the night, \nhe wanted Ginny to know that he was there, he wanted her to know where he was going. \nHe wanted to be stopped, to be dragged back, to be sent back home. . . . \n\n But he was home. Hogwards was the first and best home he had known. He and \nVoldemort and Snape, the abandoned boys, had all found home here. . . . \n\n Ginny was kneeling beside the injured girl now, holding her hand. With a huge \neffort Harry forced himself on. He thought he saw Ginny look around as he passed, and \nwondered whether she had sensed someone walking nearby, but he did not speak, and he \ndid not look back. \n\n Hagrid\u2019s hut loomed out of the darkness. There were no lights, no sound of Fang \nscrabbling at the door, his bark booming in welcome. All those visits to Hagrid, and the \ngleam of the copper kettle on the fire, and rock cakes and giant grubs, and his great \nbearded face, and Ron vomiting slugs, and Hermione helping him save Norbert . . . \n\n He moved on, and now he reached the edge of the forest, and he stopped. \n\n A swarm of dementors was gliding amongst the trees; he could feel their chill, \nand he was not sure he would be able to pass safely through it. He had not strength left \nfor a Patronus. He could no longer control his own trembling. It was not, after all, so easy \nto die. Every second he breathed, the smell of the grass, the cool air on his face, was so \nprecious: To think that people had years and years, time to waste, so much time it \ndragged, and he was clinging to each second. At the same time he thought that he would \nnot be able to go on, and knew that he must. The long game was ended, the Snitch had \nbeen caught, it was time to leave the air. . . . \n\n The Snitch. His nerveless fingers fumbled for a moment with the pouch at his \nneck and he pulled it out. \n\n I open at the close. \n\n Breathing fast and hard, he stared down at it. Now that he wanted time to move as \nslowly as possible, he seemed to have sped up, and understanding was coming so fast it \nseemed to have bypassed though. This was the close. This was the moment. \n\n He pressed the golden metal to his lips and whispered, \u201cI am about to die.\u201d \n\n The metal shell broke open. He lowered his shaking hand, raised Draco\u2019s wand \nbeneath the Cloak, and murmured, \u201cLumos.\u201d \n\n The black stone with is jagged crack running down the center sat in the two \nhalves of the Snitch. The Resurrection Stone had cracked down the vertical line \n\n\f\nrepresenting the Elder Wand. The triangle and circle representing the Cloak and the stone \nwere still discernible. \n\n And again Harry understood without having to think. It did not matter about \nbringing them back, for he was about to join them. He was not really fetching them: They \nwere fetching him. \n\n He closed his eyes and turned the stone over in his hand three times. \n\n He knew it had happened, because he heard slight movements around him that \nsuggested frail bodies shifting their footing on the earthy, twig-strewn ground that \nmarked the outer edge of the forest. He opened his eyes and looked around. \n\n They were neither ghost nor truly flesh, he could see that. They resembled most \nclosely the Riddle that had escaped from the diary so long ago, and he had been memory \nmade nearly solid. Less substantial than living bodies, but much more than ghosts, they \nmoved toward him. And on each face, there was the same loving smile. \n\n James was exactly the same height as Harry. He was wearing the clothes in which \nhe had died, and his hair was untidy and ruffled, and his glasses were a little lopsided, \nlike Mr. Weasley\u2019s. \n\n Sirius was tall and handsome, and younger by far than Harry had seen him in life. \nHe loped with an easy grace, his hands in his pockets and a grin on his face. \n\n Lupin was younger too, and much less shabby, and his hair was thicker and darker. \nHe looked happy to be back in this familiar place, scene of so many adolescent \nwanderings. \n\n Lily\u2019s smile was widest of all. She pushed her long hair back as she drew closer to \nhim, and her green eyes, so like his, searched his face hungrily, as though she would \nnever be able to look at him enough. \n\n \u201cYou\u2019ve been so brave.\u201d \n\n He could not speak. His eyes feasted on her, and he thought that he would like to \nstand and look at her forever, and that would be enough. \n\n \u201cYou are nearly there,\u201d said James. \u201cVery close. We are . . . so proud of you.\u201d \n\n \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d \n\n The childish question had fallen from Harry\u2019s lips before he could stop it. \n\n \u201cDying? Not at all,\u201d said Sirius. \u201cQuicker and easier than falling asleep.\u201d \n\n \u201cAnd he will want it to be quick. He wants it over,\u201d said Lupin. \n\n \u201cI didn\u2019t want you to die,\u201d Harry said. These words came without his volition. \n\u201cAny of you. I\u2019m sorry ---\u201c \n\n He addressed Lupin more than any of them, beseeching him. \n\n \u201c--- right after you\u2019d had your son . . . Remus, I\u2019m sorry ---\u201c \n\n \u201cI am sorry too,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cSorry I will never know him . . . but he will know \nwhy I died and I hope he will understand. I was trying to make a world in which he could \nlive a happier life.\u201d \n\n A chilly breeze that seemed to emanate from the heart of the forest lifted the hair \nat Harry\u2019s brow. He knew that they would not tell him to go, that it would have to be his \ndecision. \n\n \u201cYou\u2019ll stay with me?\u201d \n\n \u201cUntil the very end,\u201d said James. \n\n \u201cThey won\u2019t be able to see you?\u201d asked Harry. \n\n \u201cWe are part of you,\u201d said Sirius. \u201cInvisible to anyone else.\u201d \n\n\f\n Harry looked at his mother. \n\n \u201cStay close to me,\u201d he said quietly. \n\n And he set of. The dementors\u2019 chill did not overcome him; he passed through it \nwith his companions, and they acted like Patronuses to him, and together they marched \nthrough the old trees that grew closely together, their branches tangled, their roots \ngnarled and twisted underfoot. Harry clutched the Cloak tightly around him in the \ndarkness, traveling deeper and deeper into the forest, with no idea where exactly \nVoldemort was, but sure that he would find him. Beside him, making scarcely a sound, \nwalked James, Sirius, Lupin, and Lily, and their presence was his courage, and the reason \nhe was able to keep putting one foot in front of the other. \n\n His body and mind felt oddly disconnected now, his limbs working without \nconscious instruction, as if he were passenger, not driver, in the body he was about to \nleave. The dead who walked beside him through the forest were much more real to him \nnow than the living back at the castle: Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and all the others were the \nones who felt like ghosts as he stumbled and slipped toward the end of his life, toward \nVoldemort . . . \n\n A thud and a whisper: Some other living creature had stirred close by. Harry \nstopped under the Cloak, peering around, listening, and his mother and father, Lupin and \nSirius stopped too. \n\n \u201cSomeone there,\u201d came a rough whisper close at hand. \u201cHe\u2019s got an Invisibility \nCloak. Could it be --- ?\u201d \n\n Two figures emerged from behind a nearby tree: Their wands flared, and Harry \nsaw Yaxley and Dolohov peering into the darkness, directly at the place Harry, his \nmother and father and Sirius and Lupin stood. Apparently they could not see anything. \n\n \u201cDefinitely heard something,\u201d said Yaxley. \u201cAnimal, d\u2019you reckon?\u201d \n\n \u201cThat head case Hagrid kept a whole bunch of stuff in here,\u201d said Dolohov, \nglancing over his shoulder. \n\n Yaxley looked down at his watch. \n\n \u201cTime\u2019s nearly up. Porter\u2019s had his hour. He\u2019s not coming.\u201d \n\n \u201cBetter go back,\u201d said Yaxley. \u201cFind out what the plan is now.\u201d \n\n He and Dolohov turned and walked deeper into the forest. Harry followed them, \nknowing that they would lead him exactly where he wanted to go. He glanced sideways, \nand his mother smiled at him, and his father nodded encouragement. \n\n They had traveled on mere minutes when Harry saw light ahead, and Yaxley and \nDolohov stepped out into a clearing that Harry knew had been the place where the \nmonstrous Aragog had once lived. The remnants of his vast web were there still, but the \nswarms of descendants he had spawned had been driven out by the Death Eaters, to fight \nfor their cause. \n\n A fire burned in the middle of the clearing, and its flickering light fell over a \ncrowd of completely silent, watchful Death Eaters. Some of them were still masked and \nhooded; others showed their faces. Two giants sat on the outskirts of the group, casting \nmassive shadows over the scene, their faces cruel, rough-hewn like rock. Harry saw \nFenrir, skulking, chewing his long nails; the great blond Rowle was dabbing at his \nbleeding lip. He saw Lucius Malfoy, who looked defeated and terrified, and Narcissa, \nwhose eyes were sunken and full of apprehension. \n\n\f\n Every eye was fixed upon Voldemort, who stood with his head bowed, and his \nwhite hands folded over the Elder Wand in front of him. He might have been praying, or \nelse counting silently in his mind, and Harry, standing still on the edge of the scene, \nthough absurdly of a child counting in a game of hide-and-seek. Behind his head, still \nswirling and coiling, the great snake Nagini floated in her glittering, charmed cage, like a \nmonstrous halo. \n\n When Dolohov and Yaxley rejoined the circle, Voldemort looked up. \n\n \u201cNo sign of him, my Lord,\u201d said Dolohov. \n\n Voldemort\u2019s expression did not change. The red eyes seemed to burn in the \nfirelight. Slowly he drew the Elder Wand between his long fingers. \n\n \u201cMy Lord ---\u201c \n\n Bellatrix had spoken: She sat closest to Voldemort, disheveled, her face a little \nbloody but otherwise unharmed. \n\n Voldemort raised his hand to silence her, and she did not speak another word, but \neyed him in worshipful fascination. \n\n \u201cI thought he would come,\u201d said Voldemort in his high, clear voice, his eyes on \nthe leaping flames. \u201cI expected him to come.\u201d \n\n Nobody spoke. They seemed as scared as Harry, whose heart was now throwing \nitself against his ribs as though determined to escape the body he was about to cast aside. \nHis hands were sweating as he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak and stuffed it beneath his \nrobes, with his wand. He did not want to be tempted to fight. \n\n \u201cI was, it seems . . . mistaken,\u201d said Voldemort. \n\n \u201cYou weren\u2019t.\u201d \n\n Harry said it as loudly as he could, with all the force he could muster: He did not \nwant to sound afraid. The Resurrection Stone slipped from between his numb fingers, and \nout of the corner of his eyes he saw his parents, Sirius, and Lupin vanish as he stepped \nforward into the firelight. At that moment he felt that nobody mattered but Voldemort. It \nwas just the two of them. \n\n The illusion was gone as soon as it had come. The giants roared as the Death \nEaters rose together, and there were many cries, gasps, even laughter. Voldemort had \nfrozen where he stood, but his red eyes had found Harry, and he stared as Harry moved \ntoward him, with nothing but the fire between them. \n\n Then a voice yelled: \u201cHARRY! NO!\u201d \n\n He turned: Hagrid was bound and trussed, tied to a tree nearby. His massive body \nshook the branches overhead as he struggled, desperate. \n\n \u201cNO! NO! HARRY, WHAT\u2019RE YEH --- ?\u201d \n\n \u201cQUIET!\u201d shouted Rowle, and with a flick of his wand, Hagrid was silenced. \n\n Bellatrix, who had leapt to her feet, was looking eagerly from Voldemort to Harry, \nher breast heaving. The only things that moved were the flames and the snake, coiling \nand uncoiling in the glittering cage behind Voldemort\u2019s head. \n\n Harry could feel his wand against his chest, but he made no attempt to draw it. He \nknew that the snake was too well protected, knew that if he managed to point the wand at \nNagini, fifty curses would hit him first. And still, Voldemort and Harry looked at each \nother, and now Voldemort tilted his head a little to the side, considering the boy standing \nbefore him, and a singularly mirthless smile curled the lipless mouth. \n\n\f\n \u201cHarry Potter,\u201d he said very softly. His voice might have been part of the spitting \nfire. \u201cThe Boy Who Lived.\u201d \n\n None of the Death Eaters moved. They were waiting: Everything was waiting. \nHagrid was struggling, and Bellatrix was panting, and Harry thought inexplicably of \nGinny, and her blazing look, and the feel of her lips on his --- \n\n Voldemort had raised his wand. His head was still tilted to one side, like a curious \nchild, wondering what would happen if he proceeded. Harry looked back into the red \neyes, and wanted it to happen now, quickly, while he could still stand, before he lost \ncontrol, before he betrayed fear --- \n\n He saw the mouth move and a flash of green light, and everything was gone. \n\n \n\nChapter Thirty-Five \n\nKing\u2019s Cross \n\nHe lay facedown, listening to the silence. He was perfectly alone. Nobody was \nwatching. Nobody else was there. He was not perfectly sure that he was there himself. \n\n A long time later, or maybe no time at all, it came to him that he must exist, must \nbe more than disembodied thought, because he was lying, definitely lying, on some \nsurface. Therefore he had a sense of touch, and the thing against which he lay existed too. \n\n Almost as soon as he had reached this conclusion, Harry became conscious that \nhe was naked. Convinced as he was of his total solitude, this did not concern him, but it \ndid intrigue him slightly. He wondered whether, as he could feel, he would be able to see. \nIn opening them, he discovered that he had eyes. \n\n He lay in a bright mist, though it was not like mist he had ever experienced before. \nHis surroundings were not hidden by cloudy vapor; rather the cloudy vapor had not yet \nformed into surroundings. The floor on which he lay seemed to be white, neither warm \nnor cold, but simply there, a flat, blank something on which to be. \n\n He sat up. His body appeared unscathed. He touched his face. He was not wearing \nglasses anymore. \n\n Then a noise reached him through the unformed nothingness that surrounded him: \nthe small soft thumpings of something that flapped, flailed, and struggled. It was a pitiful \nnoise, yet also slightly indecent. He had the uncomfortable feeling that he was \neavesdropping on something furtive, shameful. \n\n For the first time, he wished he were clothed. \n\n Barely had the wish formed in his head than robes appeared a short distance away. \nHe took them and pulled them on. They were soft, clean, and warm. It was extraordinary \nhow they had appeared just like that, the moment he had wanted them. . . . \n\n He stood up, looking around. Was he in some great Room of Requirement? The \nlonger he looked, the more there was to see. A great domed glass roof glittered high \nabove him in sunlight. Perhaps it was a palace. All was hushed and still, except for those \nodd thumping and whimpering noises coming from somewhere close by in the mist. . . . \n\n Harry turned slowly on the spot, and his surroundings seemed to invent \nthemselves before his eyes. A wide-open space, bright and clean, a hall larger by far than \nthe Great Hall, with that clear domed glass ceiling. It was quite empty. He was the only \nperson there, except for \u2013 \n\n\f\n He recoiled. He had spotted the thing that was making the noises. It had the form \nof a small, naked child, curled on the ground, its skin raw and rough, flayed-looking, and \nit lay shuddering under a seat where it had been left, unwanted, stuffed out of sight, \nstruggling for breath. \n\n He was afraid of it. Small and fragile and wounded though it was, he did not want \nto approach it. Nevertheless he drew slowly nearer, ready to jump back at any moment. \nSoon he stood near enough to touch it, yet he could not bring himself to do it. He felt like \na coward. He ought to comfort it, but it repulsed him. \n\n \u201cYou cannot help.\u201d \n\n He spun around. Albus Dumbledore was walking toward him, sprightly and \nupright, wearing sweeping robes of midnight blue. \n\n \u201cHarry.\u201d He spread his arms wide, and his hands were both whole and white and \nundamaged. \u201cYou wonderful boy. You brave, brave man. Let us walk.\u201d \n\n Stunned, Harry followed as Dumbledore strode away from where the flayed child \nlay whimpering, leading him to two seats that Harry had not previously noticed, set some \ndistance away under that high, sparkling ceiling. Dumbledore sat down in one of them, \nand Harry fell into the other, staring at his old headmaster\u2019s face. Dumbledore\u2019s long \nsilver hair and beard, the piercingly blue eyes behind half-moon spectacles, the crooked \nnose: Everything was as he had remembered it. And yet . . . \n\n \u201cBut you\u2019re dead,\u201d said Harry. \n\n \u201cOh yes,\u201d said Dumbledore matter-of-factly. \n\n \u201cThen . . . I\u2019m dead too?\u201d \n\n \u201cAh,\u201d said Dumbledore, smiling still more broadly. \u201cThat is the question, isn\u2019t it? \nOn the whole, dear boy, I think not.\u201d \n\n They looked at each other, the old man still beaming. \n\n \u201cNot?\u201d repeated Harry. \n\n \u201cNot,\u201d said Dumbledore. \n\n \u201cBut . . .\u201d Harry raised his hand instinctively toward the lightning scar. It did not \nseem to be there. \u201cBut I should have died \u2013 I didn\u2019t defend myself! I meant to let him kill \nme!\u201d \n\n \u201cAnd that,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201cwill, I think, have made all the difference.\u201d \n\n Happiness seemed to radiate from Dumbledore like light; like fire: Harry had \nnever seen the man so utterly, so palpably content. \n\n \u201cExplain,\u201d said Harry. \n\n \u201cBut you already know,\u201d said Dumbledore. He twiddled his thumbs together. \n\n \u201cI let him kill me,\u201d said Harry. \u201cDidn\u2019t I?\u201d \n\n \u201cYou did,\u201d said Dumbledore, nodding. \u201cGo on!\u201d \n\n \u201cSo the part of his soul that was in me . . .\u201d \n\n Dumbledore nodded still more enthusiastically, urging Harry onward, a broad \nsmile of encouragement on his face. \n\n \u201c. . . has it gone?\u201d \n\n \u201cOh yes!\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cYes, he destroyed it. Your soul is whole, and \ncompletely your own, Harry.\u201d \n\n \u201cBut then . . .\u201d \n\n Harry trembled over his shoulder to where the small, maimed creature trembled \nunder the chair. \n\n\f\n \u201cWhat is that, Professor?\u201d \n\n \u201csomething that is beyond either of our help,\u201d said Dumbledore. \n\n \u201cBut if Voldemort used the Killing Curse,\u201d Harry started again, \u201cand nobody died \nfor me this time \u2013 how can I be alive?\u201d \n\n \u201cI think you know,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cThink back. Remember what he did, in \nhis ignorance, in his greed and his cruelty.\u201d \n\n Harry thought. He let his gaze drift over his surroundings. If it was indeed a \npalace in which they sat, it was an odd one, with chairs set in little rows and bits of \nrailing here and there, and still, he and Dumbledore and the stunted creatures under the \nchair were the only beings there. Then the answer rose to his lips easily, without effort. \n\n \u201cHe took my blood,\u201d said Harry. \n\n \u201cPrecisely!\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cHe took your blood and rebuilt his living body \nwith it! Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lily\u2019s protection inside both of you! He thethered \nyou to life while he lives!\u201d \n\n \u201cI live . . . while he lives? But I thought . . . I thought it was the other way around! \nI thought we both had to die? Or is it the same thing?\u201d \n\n He was distracted by the whimpering and thumping of the agonized creature \nbehind them and glanced back at it yet again. \n\n \u201cAre you sure we can\u2019t do anything?\u201d \n\n \u201cThere is no help possible.\u201d \n\n \u201cThen explain . . . more,\u201d said Harry, and Dumbledore smiled. \n\n \u201cYou were the seventh Horcrux, Harry, the Horcrux he never meant to make. He \nhad rendered his soul so unstable that it broke apart when he committed those acts of \nunspeakable evil, the murder of your parents, the attempted killing of a child. But what \nescaped from that room was even less than he knew. He left more than his body behind. \nHe left part of himself latched to you, the would-be victim who had survived. \n\n \u201cAnd his knowledge remained woefully incomplete, Harry! That which \nVoldemort does not value, he takes no trouble to comprehend. Of house-elves and \nchildren\u2019s tales, of love, loyalty, and innocence, Voldemort knows and understands \nnothing. Nothing. That they all have a power beyond his own, a power beyond the reach \nof any magic, is a truth he has never grasped. \n\n \u201cHe took your blood believing it would strengthen him. He took into his body a \ntiny part of the enchantment your mother laid upon you when she died for you. His body \nkeeps her sacrafice alive, and while that enchantment survives, so do you and so does \nVoldemort\u2019s one last hope for himself.\u201d \n\n Dumbledore smiled at Harry, and Harry stared at him. \n\n \u201cAnd you knew this? You knew \u2013 all along?\u201d \n\n \u201cI guessed. But my guesses have usually been good,\u201d said Dumbledore happily, \nand they sat in silence for what seemed like a long time, while the creature behind them \ncontinued to whimper and tremble. \n\n \u201cThere\u2019s more,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThere\u2019s more to it. Why did my wand break the \nwand he borrowed?\u201d \n\n \u201cAs to that, I cannot be sure.\u201d \n\n \u201cHave a guess, then,\u201d said Harry, and Dumbledore laughed. \n\n \u201cWhat you must understand, Harry, is that you and Lord Voldemort have \njourneyed together into realms of magic hitherto unknown and untested. But here is what \n\n\f\nI think happened, and it is unprecedented, and no wandmaker could, I think, ever have \npredicted or explained it to Voldemort. \n\n \u201cWithout meaning to, as you now know, Lord Voldemort doubled the bond \nbetween you when he returned to a human form. A part of his soul was still attached to \nyours, and, thinking to strengthen himself, he took a part of your mother\u2019s sacrafice into \nhimself. If he could only have understood the precise and terrible power of that sacrifice, \nhe would not, perhaps, have dared to touch your blood. . . . But then, if he had been able \nto understand, he could not be Lord Voldemort, and might never have murdered at all. \n\n \u201cHaving ensured this two-fold connection, having wrapped your destinies \ntogether more securely than ever two wizards were joined in history, Voldemort \nproceeded to attack you with a wand that shared a core with yours. And now something \nvery strange happened, as we know. The cores reacted in a way that Lord Voldemort, \nwho never knew that your wand was a twin of his, had ever expected. \n\n \u201cHe was more afraid than you were that night, Harry. You had accepted, even \nembraced, the possibility of death, something Lord Voldemort has never been able to do. \nYour courage won, your wand overpowered his. And in doing so, something happened \nbetween those wands, something that echoed the relationship between their masters. \n\n \u201cI believe that your wand imbibed some of the power and qualities of \nVoldemort\u2019s wand that night, which is to say that it contained a little of Voldemort \nhimself. So your wand recognized him when he pursued you, recognized a man who was \nboth kin and mortal enemy, and it regurgitated some of his own magic against him, magic \nmuch more powerful than anything Lucius\u2019s wand had ever performed. Your wand now \ncontained the power of your enormous courage and of Voldemort\u2019s own deadly skill: \nWhat chance did that poor stick of Lucius Malfoy\u2019s stand?\u201d \n\n \u201cBut if my wand was so powerful, how come Hermione was able to break it?\u201d \nasked Harry. \n\n \u201cMy dear boy, its remarkable effects were directed only at Voldemort, who had \ntampered so ill-advisedly with the deepest laws of magic. Only toward him was that \nwand abnormally powerful. Otherwise it was a wand like any other . . . though a good \none, I am sure,\u201d Dumbledore finished kindly. \n\n Harry sat in thought for a long time, or perhaps seconds. It was very hard to be \nsure of things like time, here. \n\n \u201cHe killed me with your wand.\u201d \n\n \u201cHe failed to kill you with my wand,\u201d Dumbledore corrected Harry. \u201cI think we \ncan agree that you are not dead \u2013 though, of course,\u201d he added, as if fearing he had been \ndiscourteous, \u201cI do not minimize your sufferings, which I am sure were severe.\u201d \n\n \u201cI feel great at the moment, though,\u201d said Harry, looking down at his clean, \nunblemished hands. \u201cWhere are we, exactly?\u201d \n\n \u201cWell, I was going to ask you that,\u201d said Dumbledore, looking around. \u201cWhere \nwould you say that we are?\u201d \n\n Until Dumbledore had asked, Harry had not known. Now, however, he found that \nhe had an answer ready to give. \n\n \u201cIt looks,\u201d he said slowly, \u201clike King\u2019s Cross station. Except a lo cleaner and \nempty, and there are no trains as far as I can see.\u201d \n\n \u201cKing\u2019s Cross station!\u201d Dumbledore was chuckling immoderately. \u201cGood \ngracious, really?\u201d \n\n\f\n \u201cWell, where do you think we are?\u201d asked Harry, a little defensively. \n\n \u201cMy dear boy, I have no idea. This is, as they say, your party.\u201d \n\n Harry had no idea what this meant; Dumbledore was being infuriating. He glared \nat him, then remembered a much more pressing question than that of their current \nlocation. \n\n \u201cThe Deathly Hallows,\u201d he said, and he was glad to see that the words wiped the \nsmile from Dumbledore\u2019s face. \n\n \u201cAh, yes,\u201d he said. He even looked a little worried. \n\n \u201cWell?\u201d \n\n For the first time since Harry had met Dumbledore, he looked less than an old \nman, much less. He looked fleetingly like a small boy caught in wrongdoing. \n\n \u201cCan you forgive me?\u201d he said. \u201cCan you forgive me for not trusting you? For not \ntelling you? Harry, I only feared that you would fail as I had failed. I only dreaded that \nyou would make my mistakes. I crave your pardon, Harry. I have known, for some time \nnow, that you are the better man.\u201d \n\n \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d asked Harry, startled by Dumbledore\u2019s tone, by the \nsudden tears in his eyes. \n\n \u201cThe Hallows, the Hallows,\u201d murmured Dumbledore. \u201cA desperate man\u2019s \ndream!\u201d \n\n \u201cBut they\u2019re real!\u201d \n\n \u201cReal, and dangerous, and a lure for fools,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cAnd I was such a \nfool. But you know, don\u2019t you? I have no secrets from you anymore. You know.\u201d \n\n \u201cWhat do I know?\u201d \n\n Dumbledore turned his whole body to face Harry, and tears still sparkled in the \nbrilliantly blue eyes. \n\n \u201cMaster of death, Harry, master of Death! Was I better, ultimately, than \nVoldemort?\u201d \n\n \u201cOf course you were,\u201d said Harry. \u201cOf course \u2013 how can you ask that? You never \nkilled if you could avoid it!\u201d \n\n \u201cTrue, true,\u201d said Dumbledore, and he was like a child seeking reassurance. \u201cYet \nI too sought a way to conquer death, Harry.\u201d \n\n \u201cNot the way he did,\u201d said Harry. After all his anger at Dumbledore, how odd it \nwas to sit here, beneath the high, vaulted ceiling, and defend Dumbledore from himself. \n\u201cHallows, not Horcruxes.\u201d \n\n \u201cHallows,\u201d murmured Dumbledore, \u201cnot Horcruxes. Precisely.\u201d \n\n There was a pause. The creature behind them whimpered, but Harry no longer \nlooked around. \n\n \u201cGrindelwald was looking for them too?\u201d he asked. \n\n Dumbledore closed his eyes for a moment and nodded. \n\n \u201cIt was the thing, above all, that drew us together,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cTwo clever, \narrogant boys with a shared obsession. He wanted to come to Godric\u2019s Hollow, as I am \nsure you have guessed, because of the grave of Ignotus Peverell. He wanted to explore \nthe place the third brother had died.\u201d \n\n \u201cSo it\u2019s true?\u201d asked Harry. \u201cAll of it? The Peverell brothers \u2013\u201d \n\n \u201c\u2014were the three brothers of the tale,\u201d said Dumbledore, nodding. \u201cOh yes, I \nthink so. Whether they met Death on a lonely road . . . I think it more likely that the \n\n\f\nPeverell brothers were simply gifted, dangerous wizards who succeeded in creating those \npowerful objects. The story of them being Death\u2019s own Hallows seems to me the sort of \nlegend that might have sprung up around such creations. \n\n \u201cThe Cloak, as you know now, traveled down through the ages, father to son, \nmother to daughter, right down to Ignotus\u2019s last living descendant, who was born, as \nIgnotus was, in the village of Godric\u2019s Hollow.\u201d \n\n Dumbledore smiled at Harry. \n\n \u201cMe?\u201d \n\n \u201cYou. You have guessed,, I know, why the Cloak was in my possession on the \nnight your parents died. James had showed it to me just a few days previously. It \nexplained much of his undetected wrongdoing at school! I could hardly believe what I \nwas seeing. I asked to borrow it, to examine it. I had long since given up my dream of \nuniting the Hallows, but I could not resist, could not help taking a closer look. . . . It was \na Cloak the likes of which I had never seen, immensely old, perfect in every respect . . . \nand then your father died, and I had two Hallows at last, all to myself!\u201d \n\n His tone was unbearably bitter. \n\n \u201cThe Cloak wouldn\u2019t have helped them survive, though,\u201d Harry said quickly. \n\u201cVoldemort knew where my mum and dad were. The Cloak couldn\u2019t have made them \ncurse-proof.\u201d \n\n \u201ctrue,\u201d sighed Dumbledore. \u201cTrue.\u201d \n\n Harry waited, but Dumbledore did not speak, so he prompted him. \n\n \u201cSo you\u2019d given up looking for the Hallows when you saw the Cloak?\u201d \n\n \u201cOh yes,\u201d said Dumbledore faintly. It seemed that he forced himself to meet \nHarry\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou know what happened. You know. You cannot despise me more than I \ndespise myself.\u201d \n\n \u201cBut I don\u2019t despise you \u2013\u201d \n\n \u201cThen you should,\u201d said Dumbledore. He drew a deep breath. \u201cYou know the \nsecret of my sister\u2019s ill health, what those Muggles did, what she became. You know how \nmy poor father sought revenge, and paid the price, died In Azkaban. You know how my \nmother gave up her own life to care for Ariana. \n\n \u201cI resented it, Harry.\u201d \n\n Dumbledore stated it baldly, coldly. He was looking now over the top of Harry\u2019s \nhead, into the distance. \n\n \u201cI was gifted, I was brilliant. I wanted to escape. I wanted to shine. I wanted glory. \n\n \u201cDo not misunderstand me,\u201d he said, and pain crossed the face so that he looked \nancient again. \u201cI loved them, I loved my parents, I loved my brother and my sister, but I \nwas selfish, Harry, more selfish than you, who are a remarkably selfless person, could \npossibly imagine. \n\n \u201cSo that, when my mother died, and I was left the responsibility of a damaged \nsister and a wayward brother, I returned to my village in anger and bitterness. Trapped \nand wasted, I thought! And then of course, he came. . . .\u201d \n\n Dumbledore looked directly into Harry\u2019s eyes again. \n\n \u201cGrindelwald. You cannot imagine how his ideas caught me, Harry, inflamed me. \nMuggles forced into subservience. We wizards triumphant. Grindelwald and I, the \nglorious young leaders of the revolution. \n\n\f\n \u201cOh, I had a few scruples. I assuaged my conscience with empty words. It would \nall be for the greater good, and any harm done would be repaid a hundredfold in benefits \nfor wizards. Did I know, in my heart of hearts, what Gellert Grindelwald was? I think I \ndid, but I closed my eyes. If the plans we were making came to fruition, all my dreams \nwould come true. \n\n \u201cAnd at the heart of our schemes, the Deathly Hallows! How they fascinated him, \nhow they fascinated both of us! The unbeatable wand, the weapon that would lead us to \npower! The Resurrection Stone \u2013 to him, though I pretended not to know it, it meant an \narmy of Inferi! To me, I confess, it meant the return of my parents, and the lifting of all \nresponsibility from my shoulders. \n\n \u201cAnd the Cloak . . . somehow, we never discussed the Cloak much, Harry. Both \nof us could conceal ourselves well enough without the Cloak, the true magic of which, of \ncourse, is that it can be used to protect and shield others as well as its owner. I thought \nthat, if we ever found it, it might be useful in hiding Ariana, but our interest in the Cloak \nwas mainly that it completed the trio, for the legend said that the man who had united all \nthree objects would then be truly master of death, which we took to mean \u2018invincible.\u2019 \n\n \u201cInvincible masters of death, Grindelwald and Dumbledore! Two months of \ninsanity, of cruel dreams, and neglect of the only two members of my family left to me. \n\n \u201cAnd then . . . you know what happened. Reality returned in the form of my rough, \nunlettered, and infinitely more admirable brother. I did not want to hear the truths he \nshouted at me. I did not want to hear that I could not set forth and seek Hallows with a \nfragile and unstable sister in tow. \n\n \u201cThe argument became a fight. Grindelwald lost control. That which I had always \nsensed in him, though I pretended not to, now sprang into terrible being. And Ariana . . . \nafter all my mother\u2019s care and caution . . . lay dead upon the floor.\u201d \n\n Dumbledore gave a little gasp and began to cry in earnest. Harry reached out and \nwas glad to find that he could touch him: He gripped his arm tightly and Dumbledore \ngradually regained control. \n\n \u201cWell, Grindelwald fled, as anyone but I could have predicted. He vanished, with \nhis plans for seizing power, and his schemes for Muggle torture, and his dreams of the \nDeathly Hallows, dreams in which I had encouraged him and helped him. He ran, while I \nwas left to bury my sister, and learn to live with my guilt and my terrible grief, the price \nof my shame. \n\n \u201cYears passed. There were rumors about him. They said he had procured a wand \nof immense power. I, meanwhile, was offered the post of Minister of Magic, not once, \nbut several times. Naturally, I refused. I had learned that I was not to be trusted with \npower.\u201d \n\n \u201cBut you\u2019d have been better, much better, than Fudge or Scimgeour!\u201d burst out \nHarry. \n\n \u201cWould I?\u201d asked Dumbledore heavily. \u201cI am not so sure. I had proven, as a very \nyoung man, that power was my weakness and my temptation. It is a curious thing, Harry, \nbut perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it. Those \nwho, like you, have leadership thrust upon them, and take up the mantle because they \nmust, and find to their own surprise that they wear it well. \n\n \u201cI was safer at Hogwarts. I think I was a good teacher \u2013\u201d \n\n \u201cYou were the best ---\u201d \n\n\f\n \u201c--- you are very kind, Harry. But while I busied myself with the training of \nyoung wizards, Grindelwald was raising an army. They say he feared me, and perhaps he \ndid, but less, I think, than I feared him. \n\n \u201cOh, not death,\u201d said Dumbledore, in answer to Harry\u2019s questioning look. \u201cNot \nwhat he could do to me magically. I knew that we were evenly matched, perhaps that I \nwas a shade more skillful. It was the truth I feared. You see, I never knew which of us, in \nthat last, horrific fight, had actually cast the curse that killed my sister. You may call me \ncowardly: You would be right, Harry. I dreaded beyond all things the knowledge that it \nhad been I who brought about her death, not merely through my arrogance and stupidity, \nbut that I actually struck the blow that snuffed out her life. \n\n \u201cI think he knew it, I think he knew what frightened me. I delayed meeting him \nuntil finally, it would have been too shameful to resist any longer. People were dying and \nhe seemed unstoppable, and I had to do what I could. \n\n \u201cWell, you know what happened next. I won the duel. I won the wand.\u201d \n\n Another silence. Harry did not ask whether Dumbledore had ever found out who \nstruck Ariana dead. He did not want to know, and even less did he want Dumbledore to \nhave to tell him. At last he knew what Dumbledore would have seen when he looked in \nthe mirror of Erised, and why Dumbledore had been so understanding of the fascination it \nhad exercised over Harry. \n\n They sat in silence for a long time, and the whipmerings of the creature behind \nthem barely disturbed Harry anymore. \n\n At last he said, \u201cGrindelwald tried to stop Voldemort going after the wand. He \nlied, you know, pretended he had never had it.\u201d \n\n Dumbledore nodded, looking down at his lap, tears still glittering on the crooked \nnose. \n\n \u201cThey say he showed remorse in later years, alone in his cell at Nurmengard. I \nhope that is true. I would like to think that he did feel the horror and shame of what he \nhad done. Perhaps that lie to Voldemort was his attempt to make amends . . . to prevent \nVoldemort from taking the Hallow . . .\u201d \n\n \u201c. . .or maybe from breaking into your tomb?\u201d suggested Harry, and Dumbledore \ndabbed his eyes. \n\n After another short pause Harry said, \u201cYou tried to use the Resurrection Stone.\u201d \n\n Dumbledore nodded. \n\n \u201cWhen I discovered it, after all those years, buried in the abandoned home of the \nGaunts --- the Hallow I had craved most of all, though in my youth I had wanted it for \nvery different reasons --- I lost my head, Harry. I quite forgot that I was not a Horcrux, \nthat the ring was sure to carry a curse. I picked it up, and I put it on, and for a second I \nimagined that I was about to see Ariana, and my mother, and my father, and to tell them \nhow very, very sorry, I was. . . . \n\n \u201cI was such a fool, Harry. After all those years I had learned nothing. I was \nunworthy to unite the Deathly Hallows, I had proved it time and again, and here was final \nproof.\u201d \n\n \u201cWhy?\u201d said Harry. \u201cIt was natural! You wanted to see them again. What\u2019s wrong \nwith that?\u201d \n\n \u201cMaybe a man in a million could unite the Hallows, Harry. I was fit only to \npossess the meanest of them, the least extraordinary. I was fit to own the Elder Wand, \n\n\f\nand not boast of it, and not to kill with it. I was permitted to tame and use it, because I \ntook it, not for gain, but to save others from it. \n\n \u201cBut the Cloak, I took out of vain curiousity, and so it could never have worked \nfor me as it works for you, its true owners. The stone I would have used in an attempt to \ndrag back those who are at peace, rather than enable my self-sacrafice, as you did. You \nare the worthy possessor of the Hallows.\u201d \n\n Dumbledore patted Harry\u2019s hand, and Harry looked up at the old man and smiled; \nhe could not help himself. How coul dhe remain angry with Dumbledore now? \n\n \u201cWhy did you have to make it so difficult?\u201d \n\n Dumbledore\u2019s smile was tremulous. \n\n \u201cI am afraid I counted on Miss Granger to slow you up, Harry. I was afraid that \nyour hot head might dominate your good heart. I was scared that, if presented outright \nwith the facts about those tempting objects, you might seize the Hallows as I did, at the \nwrong time, for the wrong reasons. If you laid hands on them, I wanted you to possess \nthem safely. You are the true master of death, because the true master does not seek to \nrun away from Death. He accepts that he must die, and understands that there are far, far \nworse things in the living world than dying.\u201d \n\n \u201cAnd Voldemort never knew about the Hallows?\u201d \n\n \u201cI do not think so, because he did not recognize the Resurrection Stone he turned \ninto a Horcrux. But even if he had known about them, Harry. I doubt that he woul dhave \nbeen interested in any except the first. He would not think that he needed the Cloak, and \nas for the stone, whom would he want to bring back from the dead? He fears the dead. He \ndoes not love.\u201d \n\n \u201cBut you expected him to go after the wand?\u201d \n\n \u201cI have been sure that he would try, ever since your wand beat Voldemort\u2019s in the \ngraveyard of Little Hangleton. At first, he was afraid that you had conquered him by \nsuperior skill. Once he had kidnapped Ollivander, however, he discovered the existence \nof the twin cores. He thought that explained everything. Yet the borrowed wand did no \nbetter against yours! So Voldemort, instead of asking himself what quality it was in you \nthat had made your wand so strong, what gift you possessed that he did not, naturally set \nout to find the one wand that, they said, would beat any other. For him, the Elder Wand \nhas become an obsession to rival his obsession with you. He believes that the Elder Wand \nremoves his last weakness and makes him truly invincible. Poor Severus . . .\u201d \n\n \u201cIf you planned your death with Snape, you meant him to end up with the Elder \nWand, didn\u2019t you?\u201d \n\n \u201cI admit that was my intention,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201cbut it did not work as I \nintended, did it?\u201d \n\n \u201cNo,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThat bit didn\u2019t work out.\u201d \n\n The creature behind them jerked and moaned, and Harry and Dumbledore sate \nwithout talking for the longest time yet. The realization of what would happen next \nsettled gradually over Harry in the long minutes, like softly falling snow. \n\n \u201cI\u2019ve got to go back, haven\u2019t I?\u201d \n\n \u201cThat is up to you.\u201d \n\n \u201cI\u2019ve got a choice?\u201d \n\n \u201cOh yes,\u201d Dumbledore smiled at him. \u201cWe are in King\u2019s Cross you say? I think \nthat if you decided not to go back, you would be able to . . . let\u2019s say . . . board a train.\u201d \n\n\f\n \u201cAnd where would it take me?\u201d \n\n \u201cOn,\u201d said Dumbledore simply. \n\n Silence again. \n\n \u201cVoldemort\u2019s got the Elder Wand.\u201d \n\n \u201cTrue. Voldemort has the Elder Wand.\u201d \n\n \u201cBut you want me to go back?\u201d \n\n \u201cI think,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201cthat if you choose to return, there is a chance that he \nmay be finished for good. I cannot promise it. But I know this, Harry, that you have less \nto fear from returning here than he does.\u201d \n\n Harry glanced again at the raw looking thing that trembled and choked in the \nshadow beneath the distant chair. \n\n \u201cDo not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and above all, those who live \nwithout love. By returning, you may ensure that fewer souls are maimed, fewer families \nare torn apart. If that seems to you a worthy goal, they we saw good-bye for the present.\u201d \n\n Harry nodded and sighed. Leaving this place would not be nearly as hard as \nwalking into the forest had been, but it was warm and light and peaceful here, and he \nknew that he was heading back to pain and the fear of more loss. He stood up, and \nDumbledore did the same, and they looked for a long moment into each other\u2019s faces. \n\n \u201cTell me one last thing,\u201d said Harry, \u201cIs this real? Or has this been happening \ninside my head?\u201d \n\n Dumbledore beamed at him, and his voice sounded loud and strong in Harry\u2019s \nears even though the bright mist was descending again, obscuring his figure. \n\n \u201cOf course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that \nmean it is not real?\u201d \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter Thirty-Six \n\nThe Flaw in the Plan \n\n \n\n \n\nHe was flying facedown on the grond again. The smell of the forest filled his nostrils. He \ncould feel \n\nthe cold hard ground beneath his cheek, and the hinge of his glasses which have been \nknocked sideways \n\nby the fall cutting into his temple. Every inch of him ached, and the place where Killing \nCurse had hit him \n\nfelt like the bruise of an iron-clad punch. He did not stir, but he remained exactly where \nhe had fallen, with \n\nhis left arm bent out at an akward angle and his mouth gaping. \n\n He had expected to hear cheer of triumph and jubilation at his death, but instead \nhurried footsteps, \n\nwhispers, and solicitous murmurs filled the air. \n\n \"My Lord... my Lord...\" \n\n\f\n It was Bellatrix's voice, and she spoke as if to a lover. Harry did not dare open his \neyes, but allowed \n\nhis other senses to explore his predicament. He knew that his wand was still stowed \nbeneath his robes because \n\nhe could feel it pressed between his chest and the ground. A slight cushioning effect in \nthe area of his stomach \n\ntold him that the Invisibility Cloak was also there, stuffed out of sight. \n\n \"My Lord...\" \n\n \"That will do,\" said Voldemort's voice. \n\n More footsteps. Several people were backing away from the same spot. Desperate \nto see what was \n\nhappening and why, Harry opened his eyes by a milimeter. \n\n Voldemort seemed to be getting to his feet. Various Death Eaters were hurrying \naway from him, \n\nreturning to the crowd lining the clearing. Bellatrix alone remained behind, kneeling \nbeside Voldemort. \n\n Harry closed his eyes again and considered what he had seen. The Death Eaters \nhave been buddled \n\naround Voldemort, who seem to have fallen to the ground. Something had happened \nwhen he had hit Harry with \n\nthe Killing Curse. Had Voldemort too collapsed? It seemed like it. And both of them had \nbriefly fallen unconcious \n\nand both of them had now returned. . . \n\n \"My Lord, let me --\" \n\n \"I do not require assitance,\" said Voldemort coldly, and though he could not see it, \nHarry pictured \n\nBellatrix withdrawing a helpful hand. \"The boy . . . Is he dead?\" \n\n There was a complete silence in the clearing. Nobody approached Harry, but he \nfelt their concentraded \n\ngaze; it seemed to press him harder into the ground, and he was terrified a finger or an \neyelid might twitch. \n\n \"You,\" said Voldemort, and there was a bang and a small shrick of pain. \n\"Examine him. Tell me whether he is dead.\" \n\n Harry did not know who had been sent to verify. He could only lie there, with his \nheart thumping traitorously, and wait to be \n\nexamined, but at the same time nothing, small comfort through it was, that Voldemort \nwas wary of approaching him, that Voldemort \n\nsuspected that all had not gone to plan . . . . \n\n Hands, softer than he had been expecting, touched Harry's face, and felt his heart. \nHe could hear the woman's fast breathing, \n\nher pounding of life against his ribs. \n\n \"Is Draco alive? Is he in the castle?\" \n\n The whisper was barely audible, her lips were an inch from his car, her head bent \nso low that her long hair shielded his face \n\nfrom the onlookers. \n\n \"Yes,\" he breathed back. \n\n\f\n He felt the hand on his chest contract: her nails pierced him. Then it was \nwithdrawn. She had sat up. \n\n \"He is dead!\" Narcissa Malfoy called to the watchers. \n\n And now they shouted, now they yelled in triumph and stamped their feet, and \nthrough his eyelids, Harry saw bursts of red \n\nand silver light shoot into the air in celebration. \n\n Still feigning death on the ground, he understood. Narcissa knew that the only \nway she would be permitted to enter Hogwarts, \n\nand find her son, was as part of the conquering army. She no longer cared whether \nVoldemort won. \n\n \"You see?\" screeched Voldemort over the tumult. \"Harry Potter is dead by my \nhand, and no man alive can threaten me now! \n\nWatch! Crucio!\" \n\n Harry had been expecting it, knew his body would not be allowed to remain \nunsullied upon the forest floor; it must be subjected \n\n to humiliation to prove Voldemort's victory. He was lifted into the air, and it took all his \ndetermination to remain limp, yet the pain he \n\nexpected did not come. He was thrown once, twice, three times into the air. His glasses \nflew off and he felt his wand slide a little beneath \n\nhis robes, but he kept himself floppy and lifeless, and when he fell no ground for the last \ntime, the clearing echoed with jeers and shrieks \n\nof laughter. \n\n \"Now,\" said Voldemort, \"we go to the castle, and show them what has become of \ntheir hero. Who shall drag the body? No - Wait - \" \n\n There was a fresh outbreak of laughter, and after a few moments Harry felt the \nground trembling beneath him. \n\n \"You carry him,\" Voldemort said. \"He will be nice and visible in your arms, will \nhe not? Pick up your little friend, Hagrid. And the \n\nglasses - put on the glasses - he must be recognizable - \" \n\n Someone slammed Harry's glasses back onto his face with deliberate force, but \nthe enormous hands that lifted him into the air \n\nwere exceedingly gentle. Harry could feel Hagrid's arms trembling with the force of his \nheaving sobs; great tears splashed down upon him \n\nas Hagrid cradled Harry in his arms, and Harry did not dare, by movement or word, to \nintimate to Hagrid that all was not, yet, lost. \n\n \"Move,\" said Voldemort, and Hagrid stumbled forward, forcing his way through \nthe close-growing trees, back through the forest. \n\nBranches caught at Harry's hair and robes, but he lay quiescent, his mouth lolling open, \nhis eyes shut, and in the darkness, while the \n\nDeath Eaters croed all around them, and while Hagrid sobbed blindly, nobody looked to \nsee whether a pulse beat in the exposed neck of \n\nHarry Potter. . . . \n\n The two giants crashed along behind the Death Eaters; Harry could hear trees \ncreaking and falling as they passed; they made so \n\nmuch din that birds toes shrieking into the sky, and even the jeers of the Death Eaters \nwere drowned. The victorious procession marched \n\n\f\non toward the open ground, and after a while Harry could tell, by the lightening of the \ndarkness through his closed eyelids, that the trees \n\nwere beginning to thin. \n\n \"BANE!\" \n\n Hagrid's unexpected bellow nearly forced Harry's eyes open. \"Happy now, are \nyeh, that yeh didn't fight, yeh cowardly bunch o' nags? \n\nAre yeh happy Harry Potter's - d-dead . . . ?\" \n\n Hagrid could not continue, but broke down in fresh tears. Harry wondered how \nmany centaurs were watching their procession pass; \n\nhe dared not open his eyes to look. Some of the Death Eaters called insults at the centaurs \nas they left them behind. A little later, Harry \n\nsensed, by a freshening of the air, that they had reached the edge of the forest. \n\n \"Stop.\" \n\n Harry thought that Hagrid must have been forced to obey Voldemort's command, \nbecause he lurched a little. And now a chill settled \n\nover them where they sood, and Harry heard the rasping breath of the dementors that \npatrolled the other trees. They would not affect him now. \n\nThe fact of his own survival burned inside him, a talisman against them, as though his \nfather's stag kept guardian in his heart. \n\n Someone passed close by Harry, and he knew that it was Voldemort himself \nbecause he spoke a moment later, his voice magically \n\nmagnified so that it swelled through the ground, crashing upon Harry's eardrums. \n\n \"Harry Potter is dead. He was killed as he ran away, trying to save himself while \nyou lay down your lives for him. We bring you his \n\nbody as proof that your hero is gone. \n\n \"The battle is won. You have lost half of your fighters. My Death Eaters \noutnumber you, and the Boy Who Lived is finished. There must \n\nbe no more war. Anyone who continues to resist, man, woman or child, will be \nslaughtered, as will every member of their family. Come out of the \n\ncastle now, kneel before me, and you shall be spared. Your parents and children, your \nbrothers and sisters will live and be forgiven, and you will \n\njoin me in the new world we shall build togheter.\" \n\n There was silence in the grounds and from the castle. Voldemort was so close to \nhim that Harry did not dare open his eyes again. \n\n \"Come,\" said Voldemort, and Harry heard him move ahead, and Hagrid was \nforced to follow. Now Harry opened his eyes a fraction, and saw \n\nVoldemort striding in front them, wearing the great snake Nagini around his shoulders, \nnow free of her enchanted cage. But Harry had no possibility \n\nof extracting the wand concealed under his robes without being noticed by the Death \nEaters, who marched on the either side of them through the \n\nslowly lightening darkness . . . . \n\n \"Harry,\" sobbed Hagrid. \"Oh, Harry . . . Harry . . .\" \n\n Harry shut his eyes tight again. He knew that they were approaching the castle \nand strained his ears to distinguish, above the gleeful voices \n\nof the Death Eaters and their tramping footsteps, signs of life from those within. \n\n \"Stop.\" \n\n\f\n The Death Eaters camte to a halt; Harry heard them spreading out in a line facing \nthe opne front doors of the school. He could see, even \n\nthough his closed lids, the teddish glow that meant light streamed upon him from the \nentrance hall. He waited. Any moment, the people for whom \n\nhe had tried to die would see him, lying apparently dead, in Hagrid's arms. \n\n \"NO!\" \n\n The scream was the more terrible because he had never expected or dreamed that \nProfessor McGonagall could make such a sound. He heard \n\nanother women laughing nearby, and knew that Bellatrix gloried in McGonagall's despair. \nHe squinted again for a single second and saw the open \n\n doorway filling with people, as the survivors of the battle came out onto the front steps \nto face their vanquishers and see the truth of Harry's death for \n\nthemselves. He saw Voldemort standing a little in front of him, stroking Nagini's head \nwith a single white finger. He closed his eyes again. \n\n \"No!\" \n\n \"No!\" \n\n \"Harry! HARRY!\" \n\n Ron's, Hermione's, and Ginny's voices were worse than McGonagall's; Harry \nwanted nothing more than to call back, yet he made himself lie \n\nsilent, and their cries acted like a trigger; the crowd of survivors took up the cause, \nscreaming and yelling abuse at the Death Eathers, until - \n\n \"SILENCE!\" cried Voldemort, and there was a bang and a flash of bright light, \nand silence was forced upn them all. \"It is over! Set him down, \n\nHagrid, at my feet, where he belongs!\" \n\n Harry felt himself lowered onto the grass. \n\n \"You see? said Voldemort, and Harry felt him striding backward and forward \nright beside the place where he lay. \"Harry Potter is dead! Do you \n\nunderstand now, deluded ones? He was nothing, ever, but a boy who relied on others to \nsacrifice themselves for him!\" \n\n \"He beat you!\" yelled Ron, and the charm broke, and the defenders of Hogwarts \nwere shouting and screaming again until a second, more \n\npowerful bang extinguished their voices once more. \n\n \"He was killed while trying to sneak out of the castle grounds,\" said Voldemort, \nand there was a relish in his voice for the lie. \"killed while trying \n\nto save himself - \" \n\n But Voldemort broke off: Harry heard a scuffle and a shout, then another bang, a \nflash of light, and grunt of pain; he opened his eyes an infinitesimal \n\namount. Someone had broken free of the crowd and charged at Voldemort: Harry saw the \nfigure hit the ground. Disarmed, Voldemort throwing the challenger's \n\nwand aside and laughing. \n\n \"And who is this?\" he said in his soft snake's hiss. \"Who has volunteered to \ndemonstrate what happens to those who continue to fight when the \n\nbattle is lost?\" \n\n Bellatrix gave a delighted laugh. \n\n \"It is Neville Longbottom, my Lord! The boy who has been giving the Carrows so \nmuch trouble! The son of the Aurors, remember?\" \n\n\f\n \"Ah, yes, I remember,\" said Voldemort, looking down at Neville, who was \nstruggling back to his feet, unarmed and unproctected, standing in the \n\nno-man's-land between the survivors and the Death Eaters. \"But you are a pureblood, \naren't you, my brave boy? Voldemort asked Neville, who stood facing him, \n\nhis empty hands curled in fists. \n\n \"So what if I am?\" said Neville loudly. \n\n \"You show spirit and bravery, and you come of noble stock. You will make a very \nvaluable Death Eater. We need your kind, Neville Longbottom.\" \n\n \"I'll join you when hell freezes over,\" said Neville. \"Dumbledore's Army!\" he \nshouted, and there was an answering cheer from the crowd, whom \n\nVoldemort's Silencing Charms seemed unable to hold. \n\n \"Very well,\" said Voldemort, and Harry heard more danger in the silkiness of his \nvoice than in the most powerful curse. \"If that is your choice, Longbottom, \n\nwe revert to the original plan. On your head,\" he said quietly, \"be it.\" \n\n Still watching through his lashes, Harry saw Voldemort wave his wand. Seconds \nlater, out of one of the castle's shattered windows, something that looked like a \nmisshapen bird flew through the half light and landed in Voldemort's hand. He shook the \nmildewed object by its pointed end and it dangled, emtpy and ragged: the Sorting Hat. \n\n \"There will be no more Sorting at Hogwarts School,\" said Voldemort. \"There will \nbe no more Houses. The emblem, sheild and colors of my noble ancestor, Salazar \nSlythering, will suffice everyone. Won't they, Neville Longbottom?\" \n\n He pointed his wand at Neville, who grew rigid and still, then forced the hat onto \nNeville's head, so thta it slipped down below his eyes. There were movements from the \nwatching crowd in front of the castle, and as one, the Death Eaters raised their wands, \nholding the fighters of Hogwarts at bay. \n\n \"Neville here is now going to demonstrate what happens to anyone foolish \nenough to continue to oppose me,\" said Voldemort, and with a flick of his wand, he \ncaused the Sorting Hat to burst into flames. \n\n Screams split the dawn, and Neville was a flame, rooted to the spot, unable to \nmove, and Harry could not bear it: He must act - \n\n And then many things happened at the same moment. \n\n They heard uproar from the distant boundary of the school as what sounded like \nhundreds of people came swarming over the out-of-sight walls and pelted toward the \ncastle, uttering lowd war cries. At the same time, Grawp came lumbering around the side \nof the castel and yelled, \"HAGGER!\" His cry was answered by roars from Voldemort's \ngiants: They ran at Grawp like bull elephants making the earth quake. Then came hooves \nand the twangs of bows, and arrows were suddenly falling amongst the Death Eaters, who \nbroke ranks, shouting their surprise. Harry pulled the Invisibilty Cloak from inside his \nrobes, swunt it over himself, and sprang to his feet, as Neville moved too. \n\n In one swift, fluid motin, Neville broke free of the Body-Bind Curse upon him; \nthe flaming har fell off him and he drew from its depths something silver, with a \nglittering, rubied handle - \n\n The slash of the silver blade could not be heard over the roar of the oncoming \ncrowd or the sounds of the clashing giants or of te stampending centaurs, and yet, it \nseemd to draw every eye. With a single stroke Neville sliced off the great snake's head, \nwhich spun high into the air, gleaming in the light flooding from the entrance hall, and \n\n\f\nVoldemort's mouth was open in a scream of fury that nobody could hear, and the snake's \nbody thudded to the ground at his feet- \n\n Hidden beneath the Invisibilty Cloak, Harry cast a Shield Charm between Neville \nand Voldemort before the latter could raise his stamps of the battling giants, Hagrid's yell \ncame loudets of all. \n\n \"HARRY!\" Hagrid shouted. \"HARRY - WHERE'S HARRY?\" \n\n Chaos reigned. The charging centaurs were scattering the Death Eaters, everyone \nwas feeling the giants' stamping feet, and nearer and nearar thundered the reinforcements \nthat had come from who knew where; Harry saw great winget creatues soaring the heads \nof Voldemort's giants, thestrals and Buckbeak the hippogriff scratching at their eyes \nwhile Grawp punched and pummeled them and now the wizards, defenders of Hogwarts \nand Death Eaters alike were being forced back into the castle. Harry was shooting jinxes \nand curses at any Death Eater he could see, and they crumpled, not knowing what or who \nhad hit them, and their bodies were trampled by the retreating crowd. Still hidden beneath \nthe Invisibility Cloak, Harry was buffered into the entrance hall: He was searching for \nVoldemort and saw him across the room, firing spells from his wand as he backed into \nthe Great Hall, still screaming instructions to his followers as he sent curses flying left \nand right; Harry cast more Shield Charms, and Voldemort's would-be victims. Seamus \nFinnigan and Hannah Abbott, datted past him into the Great Hall, where they joined the \nfight already flourishing inside it. \n\n And now there were more, even more people storming up the front steps, and \nHarry saw Charlie Weasly overtaking Horace Slughorn, who was still wearing his emeral \npijamas. They seemed to have returned at the head of what looked like the families and \nfriends of every Hogwarts student who had remained to fight along with the shopkeeps \nand homeowners of Hogsmeade. The centaurs Bane, Ronan and Magorian burst into the \nhall with a great clatter of hooves, as behind Harry the door that led to the kitchens was \nblasted off its hinges. \n\n The house-elves of Hogwarts swarmed intot he entrance hall, screaming and \nwaving carving knives and cleaver, and at their head, the locker of Regulus Black \nbouncing on his chest, was Kreacher, his bullfrog's voice audible even above this din: \n\"Fight! Fight! Fight for my Master, defender of house-elves! Fight the Dark Lord, in the \nname of brave Regulus! Fight!\" \n\n They were hacking and stabbing at the ankles and shim of Death Eaters their tiny \nfaces alive with malice, and everywhere Harry looked Death Eaters were folding under \nsheer weight of numbers, overcome by spells, dragging arrows from wounds, stabbed in \nthe leg by elves, or else simply attempting to escape, but swallowed by the oncoming \nhorde. \n\n But it was not over yet: Harry sped between duelers, past atruggling prosoners, \nand into he Great Hall. \n\n Voldemort was in the center of the battle, and he was striking and smiting al \nwithin reach. Harry could not get a clear shot, but fought his way nearer, still invisible, \nand the Great Hall became more and more crowded as everyone who could walk forced \ntheir way inside. \n\n Harry saw Yaxley slammed tot he floor by George and Lee Jordan, saw Dolohov \nfall with a scream at Flitwick's hands, saw Walden Macnair thrown across the room by \nHagrid, hit the stone wall opposite, and slide unconscious to the ground. He saw Ron and \n\n\f\nNeville bringing down Fenrir Greyback. Aberforth Stunning Rookwood, Arthur and \nPercy flooting Thicknesse, and Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy running through the crowd, \nnot even attempting to fight, screaming for their son. \n\n Voldemort was now dueling McGonagall, Slughorn, Kingsley all at once, and \nthere was a cold hatred in his face as they wove and ducked around him, unable to finish \nhim - \n\n Bellatrix was still fighing too, fifty yards away from Voldemort, and like her \nmaster she dueled three at once: Hermione, Ginny and Luna, all battling their hardest, but \nBellatrix was equal to them, and Harry's attention was diverted as a Killing Curse shot so \nclose to Ginny that she missed death by an inch - \n\n He changed course, running at Bellatrix rather than Voldemort, but before he had \ngone a few steps he was knocked sideways. \n\n \"NOT MY DAUGHTER, YOU BITCH!\" \n\n Mrs. Weasley threw off her cloak as she ran, freeing her arms, Bellatrix spun on \nthe spot, roaring with laughter at the sight of the new challenger. \n\n \"OUT OF MY WAY!\" shouted Mrs. Weasley to the three girls, and with a simple \nswipe of her wand she began to duel. Harry watched with terror and elation as Molly \nWeasley's wand slashed and twisted, and Bellatrix Lestrange's smile faltered and became \na snarl. Jets of light flew from both wands, the floor around the withces' feet became bot \nand cracked; both woman were fighting to kill. \n\n \"No!\" Mrs. Weasley cried as a few students ran forward, trying to come to her aid. \n\"Get back! Get back! She is mine!\" \n\n Hundreds of people now lined the walls, watching the two fights, Voldemort and \nhis three opponents, Bellatrix and Molly, and Harry stood, invisible, torn between both, \nwanting to attack and yet to protect, unable to be sure that he would not hit the innocent. \n\n \"What will happen to your children when I've killed you?\" taunted Bellatrix, as \nmad as her master, capering as Molly's curses danced around her. \"When Mummy's gone \nthe same way as Freddie?\" \n\n \"You - will - never - touch - our - children - again!\" screamed Mrs. Weasley. \n\n Bellatrix laughed the same exhilarated laugh her cousin Sirius had given as he \ntoppled backward through the veil, and suddenly Harry knew what was going to happen \nbefore it did. \n\n Molly's curse soared beneath Bellatrix's constreched arm and hit her squarely in \nthe chest, directly over her heart. \n\n Bellatrix's glounting smile froze, her eyes seemd to bulge: For the tiniest space of \ntime she knew what had happened, and then she toppled, and the watching crowd roared, \nand Voldemord screamed. \n\n Harry felt as though he turned into slow motin: he saw McGonagall, Kingsley and \nSlughorn blasted backward, flailing and writhing through the air, as Voldemort's fury at \nthe fall of his last, best leutenant exploded with the force of a bomb, Voldemort raised his \nwand and directed it at Molly Weasley. \n\n \"Protego!\" roared Harry, and the Shield Charm expanded in the middle of the \nHall, and Voldemort stared around for the source as Harry pulled off the Invisibility \nCloak at last. \n\n The yell of shock, the cheers, the screams on every side of :\"Harry!\" \"HE'S \nALIVE!\" were stifled at once. The crowd was afraid, and silence fell abruptly and \n\n\f\ncompletely as Voldemort and Harry looked at each other, and began, at the same moment, \nto circle each other. \n\n \"I don't want anyone else to help,\" Harry said loudly, and in the total silence his \nvoice carried like a trumpet call. \"It's got to be like this. It's got to be me.\" \n\n Voldemort hissed. \n\n \"Potter doesn't mean that,\" he said, his red eyes wide. \"This isn't how he works, is \nit? Who are you going to use as a shield today, Potter?\" \n\n \"Nobody,\" said Harry simply. \"There are no more Horcruxes. It's just you and me. \nNeither can live while the other survives, and one of us is about to leave for good. . . .\" \n\n \"One of us?\" jeered Voldemort, and his wholy body was taut and his red eyes \nstared, a snake that was about to strike. \"You think it will be you, do you, the boy who \nhas survived by accident, and because Dumbledore was pulling the strings?\" \n\n \"Accident, was it, when my mother died to save me?\" asked Harry. They were \nstill moving sideways, both of them, in that perfect circle, maintaining the same distance \nfrom each other, and for Harry no face existed but Voldemort's. \"Accident, when I \ndecided to fight in that graveyard? Accident, that I didn't defend myself tonight, and still \nsurvived, and returned to fight again?\" \n\n \"Accidents!\" screamed Voldemort, but still he did not strike, and the watching \ncrowd was frozen as if Petrified, and of the hundreds in the Hall, nobody seemed to \nbreathe but they two. \"Accident and chance and the fact that you crouched and sniveled \nbehind the skirts of greater men and women, and permitted me to kill them for you!\" \n\n \"You won't be killing anyone else tonight,\" said Harry as they circled, and stared \ninto each other's eyes, green into red. \"You won't be able to kill any of them ever again. \nDon't you get it? I was ready to die to stop you from hurting these people - \" \n\n \"But you did not!\" \n\n \" - I meant to, and that's what did it. I've done what my mother did. They're \nprotected from you. Haven't you noticed how none of the spells you put on them are \nbinding? You can't torture them. You can't touch them. You don't learn from your \nmistakes, Riddle, do you?\" \n\n \"You dare -\" \n\n \"Yes, I dare,\" said Harry. \"I know things you don't know, Tom Riddle. I know \nlots of important things that you don't. Want to hear some, before you make another big \nmistake?\" \n\n Voldemort did not speak, but powled in a circle, and Harry knew that he kept him \ntemporarily mesmerized at bay, held back by the faintest possibility that Harry might \nindeed know a final secret. . . . \n\n \"Is it love again?\" said Voldemort, his snake's face jeering. \"Dumbledore favorite \nsolution, love, which he claimed conqered death, though love did not stop him falling \nfrom the tower and breaking like and old waxwork? Love, which did not prevent me \nstamping out your Modblood mother like a cockroack, Potter - and nobody seems to love \nyou enough to run forward this time and take my curse. So what will stop you dying now \nwhen I strike?\" \n\n \"Just one thing,\" said Harry, and still they circled each other, wrapped in each \nother, held apart by nothing but the last secret. \n\n \"If it is not love that will save you this time,\" said Voldemort, \"you must believe \nthat you have magic that i do not, or else a weapon more powerful than mine?\" \n\n\f\n \"I believe both,\" said Harry, and he saw shock flit across the snakelike face, \nthough it was instantly dispelled; Voldemort began to laugh, and the sound was more \nfrightening than his screams; humorles and insane, it echoed around the silent Hall. \n\n \"You think you know more magic than I do?\" he said. \"Than I, than Lord \nVoldemort, who has performed magic that Dumbledore himself never dreamed of?\" \n\n \"Oh he dreamed of it,\" said Harry, \"but he knew more than you, knew enough not \nto do what you've done.\" \n\n \"You mean he was weak!\" screamed Voldemort. \"Too weak to dare, too weak to \ntake what might have been his, what will be mine!\" \n\n \"No, he was cleverer than you,\" said Harry, \"a better wizard, a better man.\" \n\n \"I brought about the death of Albus Dumbledore!\" \n\n \"You thought you did,\" said Harry, \"but you were wrong.\" \n\n For the frist time, the watching crowd stirred as the hundreds of people around the \nwalls drew breath as one. \n\n \"Dumbledore is dead!\" Voldemort hurled the words at Harry as in the marble \ntomb in the grounds of this castle, I have seen it, Potter, and he will not return!\" \n\n \"Yes, Dumbledore is dead,\" said Harry calmly, \"but you didn't have him killed. \nHe chose his own manner of dying, chose it months before he died, arranged the whole \nthing with the man you thought was your servant.\" \n\n \"What chldish dream is this?\" said Voldemort, but still he did not strike, and his \nred eyes did not waver from Harry's. \n\n \"Severus Snape wasn't yours,\" said Harry. \"Snape was Dumbledore's. \nDumbledore's from the moment you starting hunting down my mother. And you never \nrealized it, because of the thing you can't understand. You never saw Snape cast a \nPatronus, did you, Riddle?\" \n\n Voldemort did not answer. They continued to circle each other like wolves about \nto tear each other apart. \n\n \"Snape's Patronus was a doe,\" said Harry, \"the same as my mother's, because he \nloved her for nearly all of his life, from the time when they were children. You should \nhave realized,\" he said as he saw Voldemort's nostrils flare, \"he asked you to spare her \nlife, didn't he?\" \n\"He desired her, that was all,\" sneered Voldemort, \"but when she had gone, he \nagreed that there were other women, and of purer blood, worhier of him - \" \n\n \"Of course he told you that,\" said Harry, \"but he was Dumbledore's spy from the \nmoment you threatened her, and he's been working against you ever since! Dumbledore \nwas already dying when Snape finished him!\" \n\n \"It matters not!\" shrieked Voldemort, who had followed every word with rapt \nattention, but now let out a cackle of mad laughter. \"It matters not whether Snape was \nmine or Dumbledore's, or what petty obstacles they tried to put in my path! I crushed \nthem as I crushed your mother, Snape's supposed great love! Oh, but it all makes sense, \nPotter, and in ways that you do not understand! \n\n \"Dumbledore was trying to keep the Elder Wand from me! He intended that \nSnape should be the true master of the wand! But I got there ahead of you, little boy - I \nreached the wand before you could get your hands on it, I understood the truth before you \ncaught up. I killed Severus Snape three hours ago, and the Elder Wand, the Deathstick, \nthe Wand of Destiny is truly mine! Dumbledore's last plan went wrong, Harry Potter!\" \n\n\f\n \"Yeah, it did.\" said Harry. \"You're right. But before you try to kill me, I'd advise \nyou think what you've done . . . . Think, and try for some remorse, Riddle. . . .\" \n\n \"What is this?\" \n\n Of all the things that Harry had said to him, beyond any revelation or taunt, \nnothing had socked Voldemort like this. Harry saw is pupils contract to thin slits, saw the \nskin around his eyes whiten. \n\n \"It's your one last chance,\" said Harry, \"it's all you've got left. . . . I've seen what \nyou'll be otherwise. . . . Be a man. . . try. . . Try for some remorse. . . .\" \n\n \u201cYou dare --- ?\u201d said Voldemort again. \n\n \u201cYes, I dare,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbecause Dumbledore\u2019s last plan hasn\u2019t backfired on \nme at all. It\u2019s backfired on you, Riddle.\u201d \n\n Voldemort\u2019s hand was trembling on the Elder Wand, and Harry gripped Draco\u2019s \nvery tightly. The moment, he knew, was seconds away. \n\n \u201cThat wand still isn\u2019t working properly for you because you murdered the wrong \nperson. Severus Snape was never the true master of the Elder Wand. He never defeated \nDumbledore.\u201d \n\n \u201cHe killed --- \u201d \n\n \u201cAren\u2019t you listening? Snape never beat Dumbledore! Dumbledore\u2019s death was \nplanned between them! Dumbledore instended to die, undefeated, the wand\u2019s last true \nmaster! If all had gone as planned, the wand\u2019s power would have died with him, because \nit had never been won from him!\u201d \n\n \u201cBut then, Potter, Dumbledore as good as gave me the wand!\u201d Voldemort\u2019s voice \nshook with malicious pleasure. \u201cI stole the wand from its last master\u2019s tomb! I removed it \nagainst the last master\u2019s wishes! Its power is mine!\u201d \n\n \u201cYou still don\u2019t get it, Riddle, do you? Possessing the wand isn\u2019t enough! Holding \nit, using it, doesn\u2019t make it really yours. Didn\u2019t you listen to Ollivander? The wand \nchooses the wizard . . . The Elder Wand recognized a new master before Dumbledore \ndied, someone who never even laid a hand on it. The new master removed the wand from \nDumbledore against his will, never realizing exactly what he had done, or that the \nworld\u2019s most dangerous wand had given him its allegiance . . .\u201d \n\n Voldemort\u2019s chest rose and fell rapidly, and Harry could feel the curse coming, \nfeel it building inside the wand pointed at his face. \n\n \u201cThe true master of the Elder Wand was Draco Malfoy.\u201d \n\n Blank shock showed in Voldemort\u2019s face for a moment, but then it was gone. \n\n \u201cBut what does it matter?\u201d he said softly. \u201cEven if you are right, Potter, it makes \nno difference to you and me. You no longer have the phoenix wand: We duel on skill \nalone . . . and after I have killed you, I can attend to Draco Malfoy . . .\u201d \n\n \u201cBut you\u2019re too late,\u201d said Harry. \u201cYou\u2019ve missed your chance. I got there first. I \noverpowered Draco weeks ago. I took his wand from him.\u201d \n\n Harry twitched the hawthorn wand, and he felt the eyes of everyone in the Hall \nupon it. \n\n \u201cSo it all comes down to this, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d whispered Harry. \u201cDoes the wand in \nyour hand know its last master was Disarmed? Because if it does . . . I am the true master \nof the Elder Wand.\u201d \n\n A red-glow burst suddenly across the enchanted sky above them as an edge of \ndazzling sun appeared over the sill of the nearest window. The light hit both of their faces \n\n\f\nat the same time, so that Voldemort\u2019s was suddenly a flaming blur. Harry heard the high \nvoice shriek as he too yelled his best hope to the heavens, pointing Draco\u2019s wand: \n\n \u201cAvada Kedavra!\u201d \n\n \u201cExpelliarmus!\u201d \n\n The bang was like a cannon blast, and the golden flames that erupted between \nthem, at the dead center of the circle they had been treading, marked the point where the \nspells collided. Harry saw Voldemort\u2019s green jet meet his own spell, saw the Elder Wand \nfly high, dark against the sunrise, spinning across the enchanted ceiling like the head of \nNagini, spinning through the air toward the master it would not kill, who had come to \ntake full possession of it at last. And Harry, with the unerring skill of the Seeker, caught \nthe wand in his free hand as Voldemort fell backward, arms splayed, the slit pupils of the \nscarlet eyes rolling upward. Tom Riddle hit the floor with a mundane finality, his body \nfeeble and shrunken, the white hands empty, the snakelike face vacant and unknowing. \nVoldemort was dead, killed by his own rebounding curse, and Harry stood with two \nwands in his hand, staring down at his enemy\u2019s shell. \n\n One shivering second of silence, the shock of the moment suspended: and then the \ntumult broke around Harry as the screams and the cheers and the roars of the watchers \nrent the air. The fierce new sun dazzled the windows as they thundered toward him, and \nthe first to reach him were Ron and Hermione, and it was their arms that were wrapped \naround him, their incomprehensible shouts that deafened him. The Ginny, Neville, and \nLuna were there, and then all the Weasleys and Hagrid, and Kingsley and McGonagall \nand Flitwick and Sprout, and Harry could not hear a word that anyone was shouting, not \ntell whose hands were seizing him, pulling him, trying to hug some part of him, hundreds \nof them pressing in, all of them determined to touch the Boy Who Lived, the reason it \nwas over at last --- \n\n The sun rose steadily over Hogwarts, and the Great Hall blazed with life and light. \nHarry was an indispensible part of the mingled outpourings of jubilation and mourning, \nof grief and celebration. They wanted him there with them, their leader and symbol, their \nsavior and their guide, and that he had not slept, that he craved the company of only a few \nof them, seemed to occur to no one. He must speak to the bereaved, clasp their hands, \nwitness their tears, receive their thanks, hear the news now creeping in from every quarter \nas the morning drew on; that the Imperiused up and down the country had come back to \nthemselves, that Death Eaters were fleeing or else being captured, that the innocent of \nAzkaban were being released at that very moment, and that Kingsley Shacklebolt had \nbeen named temporary Minister of Magic. \n\n They moved Voldemort\u2019s body and laid it in a chamber off the Hall, away form \nthe bodies of Fred, Tonks, Lupin, Colin Creevey, and fifty others who had died fighting \nhim. McGonagall had replaced the House tables, not nobody was sitting according to \nHouse anymore: All were jumbled together, teachers and pupils, ghosts and parents, \ncentaurs and house-elves, and Firenze lay recovering in the corner, and Grawp peered in \nthrough a smashed window, and people were throwing food into his laughing mouth. \nAfter a while, exhausted and drained, Harry found himself sitting on a bench beside Luna. \n\n \u201cI\u2019d want some peace and quiet, if it were me,\u201d she said. \n\n \u201cI\u2019d love some,\u201d he replied. \n\n \u201cI\u2019ll distract them all,\u201d she said. \u201cUse your cloak.\u201d \n\n And before he could say a word, she had cried, \u201cOooh, look, a Blibbering \n\n\f\nHumdinger!\u201d and pointed out the window. Everyone who heard looked around, and \nHarry slid the Cloak up over himself, and got to his feet. \n\n Now he could move through the Hall without interference. He spotted Ginny two \ntables away; she was sitting with her head on her mother\u2019s shoulder: There would be time \nto talk later, hours and days and maybe years in which to talk. He saw Neville, the sword \nof Gryffindor lying beside his plate as he ate, surrounded by a knot of fervent admirers. \nAlong the aisle between the tables he walked, and he spotted the three Malfoys, huddled \ntogether as though unsure whether or not they were supposed to be there, but nobody was \npaying them any attention. Everywhere he looked, he saw families reunited, and finally, \nhe saw the two whose company he craved most. \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d he muttered, crouching down between them. \u201cWill you come with \nme?\u201d \n\nThey stood up at once, and together he, Ron and Hermione left the Great Hall. \nGreat chunks were missing from the marble staircase, part of the balustrade gone, and \nrubble and bloodstains occurred ever few steps as their climbed. \n\n Somewhere in the distance they could hear Peeves zooming through the \ncorridors singing a victory song of his own composition: \n\n \n\nWe did it, we bashed them, wee Potter\u2019s the one, \n\nAnd Voldy\u2019s gone moldy, so now let\u2019s have fun! \n\n \n\n \u201cReally gives a feeling for the scope and tragedy of the thing, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d said \nRon, pushing open a door to let Harry and Hermione through. \n\n Happiness would come, Harry though, but at the moment it was muffled by \nexhaustion, and the pain of losing Fred and Lupin and Tonks pierced him like a physical \nwound every few steps. Most of all he felt the most stupendous relief, and a longing to \nsleep. But first he owed an explanation to Ron and Hermione, who had stuck with him for \nso long, and who deserved the truth. Painstakingly he recounted what he had seem in the \nPensieve and what had happened in the forest, and they had not even begun to express all \ntheir shock and amazement, when at last they arrived at the place to which they had been \nwalking, though none of them had mentioned their destination. \n\n Since he had last seen it, the gargoyle guarding the entrance to the headmaster\u2019s \nstudy had been knocked aside; it stood lopsided, looking a little punch-drunk, and Harry \nwondered whether it would be able to distinguish passwords anymore. \n\n \u201cCan we go up?\u201d he asked the gargoyle. \n\n \u201cFeel free,\u201d groaned the statue. \n\n They clambered over him and onto the spiral stone staircase that moved slowly \nupward like an escalator. Harry pushed open the door at the top. \n\n He had one, brief glimpse of the stone Pensieve on the desk where he had left it, \nand then an earsplitting noise made him cry out, thinking of curses and returning Death \nEaters and the rebirth of Voldemort --- \n\n But it was applause. All around the walls, the headmasters and headmistresses of \nHogwarts were giving him a standing ovation; they waved their hats and in some cases \ntheir wigs, they reached through their frames to grip each other\u2019s hands; they danced up \nand down on their chairs in which they have been painted: Dilys Derwent sobbed \nunashamedly; Dexter Fortescue was waving his ear-trumpet; and Phineas Niggelus called, \n\n\f\nin his high, reedy voice, \u201cAnd let it be noted that Slytherin House played its part! Let our \ncontribution not be forgotten!\u201d \n\n But Harry had eyes only for the man who stood in the largest portrait directly \nbehind the headmaster\u2019s chair. Tears were sliding down from behind the half-moon \nspectacles into the long silver beard, and the pride and the gratitude emanating from him \nfilled Harry wit h the same balm as phoenix song. \n\n At last, Harry held up his hands, and the portraits fell respectfully silent, beaming \nand mopping their eyes and waiting eagerly for him to speak. He directed his words at \nDumbledore, however, and chose them with enormous care. Exhausted and bleary-eyed \nthough he was, he must make one last effort, seeking one last piece of advice. \n\n \u201cThe thing that was hidden in the Snitch,\u201d he began, \u201cI dropped it in the forest. I \ndon\u2019t exactly here, but I\u2019m not going to go looking for it again. Do you agree?\u201d \n\n \u201cMy dear boy, I do,\u201d said Dumbledore, while his fellow pictures looked confused \nand curious. \u201cA wise and courageous decision, but no less than I would have expected of \nyou. Does anyone know else know where it fell?\u201d \n\n \u201cNo one,\u201d said Harry, and Dumbledore nodded his satisfaction. \n\n \u201cI\u2019m going to keep Ignotus\u2019s present, though,\u201d said Harry, and Dumbledore \nbeamed. \n\n \u201cBut of course, Harry, it is yours forever, until you pass it on!\u201d \n\n \u201cAnd then there\u2019s this.\u201d \n\n Harry held up the Elder Wand, and Ron and Hermione looked at it with a \nreverence that, even in his befuddled and sleep-deprived state, Harry did not like to see. \n\n \u201cI don\u2019t want it.\u201d said Harry. \n\n \u201cWhat?\u201d said Ron loudly. \u201cAre you mental?\u201d \n\n \u201cI know it\u2019s powerful,\u201d said Harry wearily. \u201cBut I was happier with mine. So . . .\u201d \n\n He rummaged in the pouch hung around his neck, and pulled out the two halves \nof holly tstill just connected by the finest threat of phoenix feather. Hermione had said \nthat they could not be repaired, that the damage was too severe. All he knew was that if \nthis did not work, nothing would. \n\n He laid the broken wand upon the headmaster\u2019s desk, touched it with the very tip \nof the Elder Wand, and said, \u201cReparo.\u201d \n\n As his wand resealed, red sparks flew out of its end. Harry knew that he had \nsucceeded. He picked up the holly and phoenix wand and felt a sudden warmth in his \nfingers, as though wand and hand were rejoicing at their reunion. \n\n \u201cI\u2019m putting the Elder Wand,\u201d he told Dumbledore, who was watching him with \nenormous affection and admiration, \u201cback where it came from. It can stay there. If I die a \nnatural death like Ignotus, its power will be broken, won\u2019t it? The previous master will \nnever have been defeated. That\u2019ll be the end of it. \n\n Dumbledore nodded. They smiled at each other. \n\n \u201cAre you sure?\u201d said Ron. There was the faintest trace of longing in his voice as \nhe looked at the Elder Wand. \n\n \u201cI think Harry\u2019s right,\u201d said Hermione quietly. \n\n \u201cThat wand\u2019s more trouble than it\u2019s worth.\u201d said Harry. \u201cAnd quite honestly,\u201d he \nturned away from the painted portraits, thinking now only of the four-poster bed lying \nwaiting for him in Gryffindor Tower, and wondering whether Kreacher might bring him a \nsandwich there, \u201cI\u2019ve had enough trouble for a lifetime.\u201d \n\n\f\n \n\nEpilogue \n\nNineteen Years Later \n\n \n\n \n\nAutumn seemed to arrive suddenly that year. The morning of the first of September was \ncrisp as an apple, and as the little family bobbed across the rumbling road toward the \ngreat sooty station, the fumes of car exhausts and the breath of pedestrians sparkled like \ncobwebs in the cold air. Two large cages tattled on top of the laden trolleys the parents \nwere pushing; the owls inside them hooted indignantly, and the redheaded girl trailed \nfearfully behind here brothers, clutching her father's arm. \n\n \"It won't be long, and you'll be going too,\" Harry told her. \n\n \"Two years,\" sniffed Lily. \"I want to go now!\" \n\n The commuters stared curiously at the owls as the family wove its way toward the \nbarrier between platforms nine and ten, Albus's voice drifted back to Harry over the \nsurrounding clamor; his sons had resumed the argument they had started in the car. \n\n \"I won't! I won't be a Slytherin!\" \n\n \"James, give it a rest!\" said Ginny. \n\n \"I only said he might be,\" said James, grinning at his younger brother. \"There's \nnothing wrong with that. He might be in Slytherin\" \n\n But James caught his mother's eye and fell silent. The five Potters approached the \nbarrier. With a slightly cocky look over his shoulder at his younger brother, James took \nthe trolley from his mother and broke into a run. A moment later, he had vanished. \n\n \"You'll write to me, won't you?\" Albus asked his parents immediately, \ncapitalizing on the momentary absence of his brother. \n\n \"Every day, of you want us to,\" said Ginny. \n\n \"Not every day,\" said Albus quickly, \"James says most people only get letters \nfrom home about once a month.\" \n\n \"We wrote to James three times a week last year,\" said Ginny. \n\n \"And you don't want to believe everything he tells you about Hogwarts,\" Harry \nput in. \"He likes a laugh, your brother.\" \n\n Side by side, they pushed the second trolley forward, gathering speed. As they \nreached the barrier, Albus winced, but no collision came. Instead, the family emerged \nonto platform nine and three-quarters, which was obscured by thick white steam that was \npouring from the scarlet Hogwarts Express. Indistinct figures were swarming through the \nmist, into which James had already disappeared. \n\n \"Where are they?\" asked Albus anxiously, peering at the hazy forms they passed \nas they made their way down the platform. \n\n \"We'll find them,\" said Ginny reassuringly. \n\n But the vapor was dense, and it was difficult to make out anybody's faces. \nDetached from their owners, voices sounded unnaturally loud, Harry thought he head \nPercy discoursing loudly on broomstick regulations, and was quite glad of the excuse not \nto stop and say hello. . . . \n\n \"I think that's them, Al,\" said Ginny suddenly. \n\n\f\n A group of four people emerged from the mist, standing alongside the very last \ncarriage. Their faces only came into focus when Harry, Ginny, Lily, and Albus had drawn \nright up to them. \n\n \"Hi,\" said Albus, sounding immensely relieved. \n\n Roses, who was already wearing her brand-new Hogwarts robes, beamed at him. \n\n \"Parked all right, then?\" Ron asked Harry. \"I did. Hermione didn't believe I could \npass a Muggle driving test, did you? She thought I'd have to Confound the examiner.\" \n\n \"No, I didn't,\" said Hermione, \"I had complete faith in you.\" \n\n \"As a matter of fact, I did Confund him,\" Ron whispered to Harry, as together \nthey lifted Albus's trunk and owl onto the train. \"I only forgot to look in the wing mirror, \nand let's face it, I can use a Supersensory Charm for that.\" \n\n Back on the platform, they found Lily and Hugo, Rose's younger brother, having \nan animated discussion about which House they would be sorted into when they finally \nwent to Hogwarts. \n\n \"If you're not in Gryffindor, we'll disinherit you,\" said Ron, \"but no pressure.\" \n\n \"Ron!\" \n\n Lily and Hugo laughed, but Albus and Rose looked solemn. \n\n \"He doesn't mean it,\" said Hermione and Ginny, but Ron was no longer paying \nattention. Catching Harry's eye, he nodded covertly to a point some fifty yards away. The \nsteam had thinned for a moment, and three people stood in sharp relief against the \nshifting mist. \n\n \"Look who it is.\" \n\n Draco Malfoy was standing there with his wife and son, a dark coat buttoned up \nto his throat. His hair was receding somewhat, which emphasized the pointed chin. The \nnew boy resembled Draco as much as Albus resembled Harry. Draco caught sight of \nHarry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny staring at him, nodded curtly, and turned away again. \n\n \"So that's little Scorpius,\" said Ron under his breath. \"Make sure you beat him in \nevery test, Rosie. Thank God you inherited your mother's brains.\" \n\n \"Ron, for heaven's sake,\" said Hermione, half stern, half amused. \"Don't try to \nturn them against each other before they've even started school!\" \n\n \"You're right, sorry,\" said Ron, but unable to help himself, he added, \"Don't get \ntoo friendly with him, though, Rosie. Granddad Weasley would never forgive you if you \nmarried a pureblood.\" \n\n \"Hey!\" \n\n James had reappeared; he had divested himself of his trunk, owl, and trolley, and \nwas evidently bursting with news. \n\n \"Teddy's back there,\" he said breathlessly, pointing back over his shoulder into \nthe billowing clouds of steam. \"Just seen him! And guess what he's doing? Snogging \nVictoire!\" \n\n He gazed up at the adults, evidently disappointed by the lack of reaction. \n\n \"Our Teddy! Teddy Lupin! Snogging our Victoire! Our cousin! And I asked teddy \nwhat he was doing --\" \n\n \"You interrupted them?\" said Ginny. \"You are so like Ron --\" \n\n \"-- and he said he'd come to see her off! And then he told me to go away. He's \nsnogging her!\" James added as though worried he had not made himself clear. \n\n\f\n \"Oh, it would be lovely if they got married!\" whispered Lily ecstatically. \"Teddy \nwould really be part of the family then!\" \n\n \"He already comes round for dinner about four times a week,\" said Harry \"Why \ndon't we just invite him to live with is and have done with it?\" \n\n \"Yeah!\" said James enthusiastically. \"I don't mind sharing with Al--Teddy could \nhave my room!\" \n\n \"No,\" said Harry firmly, \"you and Al will share a room only when I want the \nhouse demolished.\" \n\n He checked the battered old watch that had once been Fabian Prewett's. \n\n \"It's nearly eleven, you'd better get on board.\" \n\n \"Don't forget to give Neville our love!\" Ginny told James as she hugged him. \n\n \"Mum! I can't give a professor love!\" \n\n \"But you know Neville--\" \n\n James rolled his eyes. \n\n \"Outside, yeah, but at school he's Professor Longbottom, isn't he? I can't walk into \nHerbology and give him love. . . .\" \n\n Shaking his head at his mother's foolishness, he vented his feelings by aiming a \nkick at Albus. \n\n \"See you later, Al. Watch out for the thestrals.\" \n\n \"I thought they were invisible? You said they were invisible!\" \n\n but James merely laughed, permitted his mother to kiss him, gave his father a \nfleeting hug, then leapt onto the rapidly filling train. They saw him wave, then sprint \naway up the corridor to find his friends. \n\n \"Thestrals are nothing to worry about,\" Harry told Albus. \"They're gentle things, \nthere's nothing scare about them. Anyway, you won't be going up to school in the \ncarriages, you'll be going in the boats.\" \n\n Ginny kissed Albus good-bye. \n\n \"See you at Christmas.\" \n\n \"Bye, Al,\" said Harry as his son hugged him. \"Don't forget Hagrid's invited you to \ntea next Friday. Don't mess with Peeves. Don't duel anyone till you're learned how. And \ndon't let James wind you up.\" \n\n \"What if I'm in Slytherin?\" \n\n The whisper was for his father alone, and Harry knew that only the moment of \ndeparture could have forced Albus to reveal how great and sincere that fear was. \n\n Harry crouched down so that Albus's face was slightly above his own. Alone of \nHarry's three children, Albus had inherited Lily's eyes. \n\n \"Ablus Severus,\" Harry said quietly, so that nobody but Ginny could hear, and she \nwas tactful enough to pretend to be waving to rose, who was now on the train, \"you were \nnamed for two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was \nprobably the bravest man I ever knew.\" \n\n \"But just say--\" \n\n \"--then Slytherin House will have gained an excellent student, won't it? It doesn't \nmatter to us, Al. But if it matter to you, you'll be able to choose Gryffindor over Slytherin. \nThe Sorting Hat takes your choice into account.\" \n\n \"Really?\" \n\n \"It did for me,\" said Harry. \n\n\f\n He had never told any of his children that before, and he saw the wonder in \nAlbus's face when he said it. But how the doorsr were slamming all along the scarlet train, \nand the blurred outlines of parents swarming forward for final kisses, last-minute \nreminders, Albus jumped into the carriage and ginny closed the door behind him. \nStudents were hanging from the windows nearest them. A great number of faces, both on \nthe train and off, seemed to be turned toward Harry. \n\n \"Why are they all staring?\" demanded Albus as he and rose craned around to look \nat the other students. \n\n \"Don't let it worry you,\" said Ron. \"It's me, I'm extremely famous.\" \n\n Albus, Rose, Hugo, and Lily laughed. The train began to more, and Harry walked \nalongside it, watching his son's thin face, already ablaze with excitement. Harry kept \nsmiling and waving, even though it was like a little bereavement, watching his son glide \naway from him. . . . \n\n The last trace of steam evaporated in the autumn air. The train rounded a corner. \nHarry's hand was still raised in farewell. \n\n \"He'll be alright,\" murmured Ginny. \n\n As Harry looked dat her, he lowered his hand absentmindedly and touched the \nlightning scar on his forehead. \n\n \"I know he will.\" \n\n The scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years. All was well. \n", "HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS \nby J. K. Rowling\n\u3000\u3000(this is BOOK 2 in the Harry Potter series)\n\u3000\u3000Original Scanned/OCR: Friday, April 07, 2000 v1.0 (edit where needed, change version number by 0.1)\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER\tONE\n\u3000\u3000THE WORST BIRTHDAY\n\u3000\u3000Not for the first time, an argument had broken out over breakfast at number four, Privet Drive. Mr. Vernon Dursley had been woken in the early hours of the morning by a loud, hooting noise from his nephew Harry's room.\n\u3000\u3000\"Third time this week!\" he roared across the table. \"If you can't control that owl, it'll have to go!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry tried, yet again, to explain.\n\u3000\u3000\"She's bored,\" he said. \"She's used to flying around outside. If I could just let her out at night -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Do I look stupid?\" snarled Uncle Vernon, a bit of fried egg dangling from his bushy mustache. \"I know what'll happen if that owl's let out.\"\n\u3000\u3000He exchanged dark looks with his wife, Petunia.\n\u3000\u3000Harry tried to argue back but his words were drowned by a long, loud belch from the Dursleys' son, Dudley.\n\u3000\u30001\n\u3000\u3000\"I want more bacon.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"There's more in the frying pan, sweetums,\" said Aunt Petunia, turning misty eyes on her massive son. \"We must build you up while we've got the chance .... I don't like the sound of that school food ......\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Nonsense, Petunia, I never went hungry when I was at Smeltings,\" said Uncle Vernon heartily. \"Dudley gets enough, don't you, son?\"\n\u3000\u3000Dudley, who was so large his bottom drooped over either side of the kitchen chair, grinned and turned to Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Pass the frying pan.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You've forgotten the magic word,\" said Harry irritably.\n\u3000\u3000The effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the family was incredible: Dudley gasped and fell off his chair with a crash that shook the whole kitchen; Mrs. Dursley gave a small scream and clapped her hands to her mouth; Mr. Dursley jumped to his feet, veins throbbing in his temples.\n\u3000\u3000\"I meant `please'!\" said Harry quickly. \"I didn't mean -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU,\" thundered his uncle, spraying spit over the table, \"ABOUT SAYING THE `M' WORD IN OUR HOUSE?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But I -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"HOW DARE YOU THREATEN DUDLEY!\" roared Uncle Vernon, pounding the table with his fist.\n\u3000\u3000\"I just -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I WARNED YOU! I WILL NOT TOLERATE MENTION OF YOUR ABNORMALITY UNDER THIS ROOF!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry stared from his purple-faced uncle to his pale aunt, who was trying to heave Dudley to his feet.\n\u3000\u3000\"All right,\" said Harry, \"all right. . . \"\n\u3000\u3000 Uncle Vernon sat back down, breathing like a winded rhinoceros and watching Harry closely out of the corners of his small, sharp eyes.\n\u3000\u3000Ever since Harry had come home for the summer holidays, Uncle Vernon had been treating him like a bomb that might go off at any moment, because Harry Potter wasn't a normal boy. As a matter of fact, he was as not normal as it is possible to be.\n\u3000\u3000Harry Potter was a wizard - a wizard fresh from his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. And if the Dursleys were unhappy to have him back for the holidays, it was nothing to how Harry felt.\n\u3000\u3000He missed Hogwarts so much it was like having a constant stomachache. He missed the castle, with its secret passageways and ghosts, his classes (though perhaps not Snape, the Potions master), the mail arriving by owl, eating banquets in the Great Hall, sleeping in his four-poster bed in the tower dormitory, visiting the gamekeeper, Hagrid, in his cabin next to the Forbidden Forest in the grounds, and, especially, Quidditch, the most popular sport in the wizarding world (six tall goal posts, four flying balls, and fourteen players on broomsticks).\n\u3000\u3000All Harry's spellbooks, his wand, robes, cauldron, and top-of-the-line Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick had been locked in a cupboard under the stairs by Uncle Vernon the instant Harry had come home. What did the Dursleys care if Harry lost his place on the House Quidditch team because he hadn't practiced all summer? What was it to the Dursleys if Harry went back to school without any of his homework done? The Dursleys were what wizards called Muggles (not a drop of magical blood in their veins),\n\u3000\u3000and as far as they were concerned, having a wizard in the family was a matter of deepest shame. Uncle Vernon had even padlocked Harry's owl, Hedwig, inside her cage, to stop her from carrying messages to anyone in the wizarding world.\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked nothing like the rest of the family. Uncle Vernon was large and neckless, with an enormous black mustache; Aunt Petunia was horse-faced and bony; Dudley was blond, pink, and porky. Harry, on the other hand, was small and skinny, with brilliant green eyes and jet-black hair that was always untidy. He wore round glasses, and on his forehead was a thin, lightning-shaped scar.\n\u3000\u3000It was this scar that made Harry so particularly unusual, even for a wizard. This scar was the only hint of Harry's very mysterious past, of the reason he had been left on the Dursleys' doorstep eleven years before.\n\u3000\u3000At the age of one year old, Harry had somehow survived a curse from the greatest Dark sorcerer of all time, Lord Voldemort, whose name most witches and wizards still feared to speak. Harry's parents had died in Voldemort's attack, but Harry had escaped with his lightning scar, and somehow - nobody understood why Voldemort's powers had been destroyed the instant he had failed to kill Harry.\n\u3000\u3000So Harry had been brought up by his dead mother's sister and her husband. He had spent ten years with the Dursleys, never understanding why he kept making odd things happen without meaning to, believing the Dursleys' story that he had got his scar in the car crash that had killed his parents.\n\u3000\u3000And then, exactly a year ago, Hogwarts had written to Harry,\n\u3000\u3000and the whole story had come out. Harry had taken up his place at wizard school, where he and his scar were famous ... but now the school year was over, and he was back with the Dursleys for the summer, back to being treated like a dog that had rolled in something smelly.\n\u3000\u3000The Dursleys hadn't even remembered that today happened to be Harry's twelfth birthday. Of course, his hopes hadn't been high; they'd never given him a real present, let alone a cake - but to ignore it completely ...\n\u3000\u3000At that moment, Uncle Vernon cleared his throat importantly and said, \"Now, as we all know, today is a very important day.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked up, hardly daring to believe it.\n\u3000\u3000\"This could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career, \" said Uncle Vernon.\n\u3000\u3000Harry went back to his toast. Of course, he thought bitterly, Un cle Vernon was talking about the stupid dinner party. He'd been talk ing of nothing else for two weeks. Some rich builder and his wife were coming to dinner and Uncle Vernon was hoping to get a huge order from him (Uncle Vernon's company made drills).\n\u3000\u3000\"I think we should run through the schedule one more time,\" said Uncle Vernon. \"We should all be in position at eight o'clock. Petunia, you will be -?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"In the lounge,\" said Aunt Petunia promptly, \"waiting to welcome them graciously to our home.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Good, good. And Dudley?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll be waiting to open the door.\" Dudley put on a foul, simpering smile. \"May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"They'll love him!\" cried Aunt Petunia rapturously.\n\u3000\u3000\"Excellent, Dudley,\" said Uncle Vernon. Then he rounded on Harry. \"And you?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending I'm not there,\" said Harry tonelessly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Exactly,\" said Uncle Vernon nastily. \"I will lead them into the lounge, introduce you, Petunia, and pour them -drinks. At eight- fifteen -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll announce dinner,\" said Aunt Petunia.\n\u3000\u3000\"And, Dudley, you'll say -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"May I take you through to the dining room, Mrs. Mason?\" said Dudley, offering his fat arm to an invisible woman.\n\u3000\u3000\"My perfect little gentleman!\" sniffed Aunt Petunia.\n\u3000\u3000\"And you?\" said Uncle Vernon viciously to Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I'm not there,\" said Harry dully.\n\u3000\u3000\"Precisely. Now, we should aim to get in a few good compliments at dinner. Petunia, any ideas?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Vernon tells me you're a wonderful golfer, Mr. Mason.... Do tell me where you bought your dress, Mrs. Mason ......\n\u3000\u3000\"Perfect. . . Dudley?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"How about -'We had to write an essay about our hero at school, Mr. Mason, and I wrote about you.\"'\n\u3000\u3000This was too much for both Aunt Petunia and Harry. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and hugged her son, while Harry ducked under the table so they wouldn't see him laughing.\n\u3000\u3000\"And you, boy?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry fought to keep his face straight as he emerged.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I'm not there,\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000\"Too right, you will,\" said Uncle Vernon forcefully. \"The Ma sons don't know anything about you and it's going to stay that way. When dinner's over, you take Mrs. Mason back to the lounge for coffee, Petunia, and I'll bring the subject around to drills. With any luck, I'll have the deal signed and sealed before the news at ten. be shopping for a vacation home in Majorca this time to morrow. Harry couldn't feel too excited about this. He didn't think the Dursleys would like him any better in Majorca than they did on Privet Drive. \"Right - I'm off into town to pick up the dinner jackets for Dudley and me. And you,\" he snarled at Harry. \"You stay out of your aunt's way while she's cleaning.\" Harry left through the back door. It was a brilliant, sunny day. He crossed the lawn, slumped down on the garden bench, and sang under his breath: \"Happy birthday to me ... happy birthday to me. . . No cards, no presents, and he would be spending the evening pretending not to exist. He gazed miserably into the hedge. He had never felt so lonely. More than anything else at Hogwarts, more even than playing Quidditch, Harry missed his best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. They, however, didn't seem to be missing him at all. Neither of them had written to him all summer, even though Ron had said he was going to ask Harry to come and stay. Countless times, Harry had been on the point of unlocking Hedwig's cage by magic and sending her to Ron and Hermione with a letter, but it wasn't worth the risk. Underage wizards weren't allowed to use magic outside of school. Harry hadn't told the\n\u3000\u3000Dursleys this; he knew it was only their terror that he might turn them all into dung beetles that stopped them from locking him in the cupboard under the stairs with his wand and broomstick. For the first couple of weeks back, Harry had enjoyed muttering nonsense words under his breath and watching Dudley tearing out of the room as fast as his fat legs would carry him. But the long silence from Ron and Hermione had made Harry feel so cut off from the magical world that even taunting Dudley had lost its appeal - and now Ron and Hermione had forgotten his birthday.\n\u3000\u3000What wouldn't he give now for a message from Hogwarts? From any witch or wizard? He'd almost be glad of a sight of his archenemy, Draco Malfoy, just to be sure it hadn't all been a dream ....\n\u3000\u3000Not that his whole year at Hogwarts had been fun. At the very end of last term, Harry had come face-to-face with none other than Lord Voldemort himself. Voldemort might be a ruin of his former self, but he was still terrifying, still cunning, still determined to regain power. Harry had slipped through Voldemort's clutches for a second time, but it had been a narrow escape, and even now, weeks later, Harry kept waking in the night, drenched in cold sweat, wondering where Voldemort was now, remembering his livid face, his wide, mad eyes\n\u3000\u3000Harry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench. He had been staring absent-mindedly into the hedge - and the hedge was staring back. Two enormous green eyes had appeared among the leaves.\n\u3000\u3000Harry jumped to his feet just as a jeering voice floated across the lawn.\n\u3000\u3000\"I know what day it is,\" sang Dudley, waddling toward him.\n\u3000\u3000The huge eyes blinked and vanished.\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" said Harry, not taking his eyes off the spot where they had been.\n\u3000\u3000\"I know what day it is,\" Dudley repeated, coming right up to him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well done,\" said Harry. \"So you've finally learned the days of the week.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Today's your birthday,\" sneered Dudley. \"How come you haven't got any cards? Haven't you even got friends at that freak place?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Better not let your mum hear you talking about my school,\" said Harry coolly.\n\u3000\u3000Dudley hitched up his trousers, which were slipping down his fat bottom.\n\u3000\u3000\"Why're you staring at the hedge?\" he said suspiciously.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm trying to decide what would be the best spell to set it on fire,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000Dudley stumbled backward at once, a look of panic on his fat face.\n\u3000\u3000\"You c-can't - Dad told you you're not to do m-magic - he said he'll chuck you out of the house - and you haven't got anywhere else to go - you haven't got any friends to take you -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Jiggery pokery!\" said Harry in a fierce voice. \"Hocus pocus squiggly wiggly -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"MUUUUUUM!\" howled Dudley, tripping over his feet as he dashed back toward the house. \"MUUUUM! He's doing you know what!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry paid dearly for his moment of fun. As neither Dudley nor\n\u3000\u3000the hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt Petunia knew he hadn't really done magic, but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan. Then she gave him work to do, with the promise he wouldn't eat again until he'd finished.\n\u3000\u3000While Dudley lolled around watching and eating ice cream, Harry cleaned the windows, washed the car, mowed the lawn, trimmed the flowerbeds, pruned and watered the roses, and repainted the garden bench. The sun blazed overhead, burning the back of his neck. Harry knew he shouldn't have risen to Dudley's bait, but Dudley had said the very thing Harry had been thinking himself... maybe he didn't have any friends at Hogwarts ....\n\u3000\u3000Wish they could see famous Harry Potter now, he thought savagely as he spread manure on the flower beds, his back aching, sweat running down his face.\n\u3000\u3000It was half past seven ,in the evening when at last, exhausted, he heard Aunt Petunia calling him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Get in here! And walk on the newspaper!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming kitchen. On top of the fridge stood tonight's pudding: a huge mound of whipped cream and sugared violets. A loin of roast pork was sizzling in the oven.\n\u3000\u3000\"Eat quickly! The Masons will be here soon!\" snapped Aunt Petunia, pointing to two slices of bread and a lump of cheese on the kitchen table. She was already wearing a salmon-pink cocktail dress.\n\u3000\u3000Harry washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful supper. The moment he had finished, Aunt Petunia whisked away his plate. \"Upstairs! Hurry!\"\n\u3000\u3000As he passed the door to the living room, Harry caught a glimpse of Uncle Vernon and Dudley in bow ties and dinner jack ets. He had only just reached the upstairs landing when the door bell rang and Uncle Vernon's furious face appeared at the foot of the stairs. \"Remember, boy - one sound -\" Harry crossed to his bedroom on tiptoe slipped inside, closed the door, and turned to collapse on his bed. The trouble was, there was already someone sitting on it.\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER TWo\n\u3000\u3000I\n\u3000\u3000DOBBY'S WARNING\n\u3000\u3000arry managed not to shout out, but it was a close thing. The little creature on the bed had large, bat-like ears and bulging green eyes the size of tennis balls. Harry knew instantly that this was what had been watching him out of the garden hedge that morning.\n\u3000\u3000As they stared at each other, Harry heard Dudley's voice from the hall.\n\u3000\u3000\"May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?\"\n\u3000\u3000 The creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low that the end of its long, thin nose touched the carpet. Harry noticed that it was wearing what looked like an old pillowcase, with rips for arm- and leg-holes.\n\u3000\u3000\"Er - hello,\" said Harry nervously.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry Potter!\" said the creature in a high-pitched voice Harry was sure would carry down the stairs. \"So long has Dobby wanted to meet you, sir ... Such an honor it is . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Th-thank you,\" said Harry, edging along the wall and sinking into his desk chair, next to Hedwig, who was asleep in her large cage. He wanted to ask, \"What are you?\" but thought it would sound too rude, so instead he said, \"Who are you?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Dobby, sir. Just Dobby. Dobby the house-elf,\" said the creature.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh - really?\" said Harry. \"Er - I don't want to be rude or anything, but - this isn't a great time for me to have a house-elf in my bedroom.\"\n\u3000\u3000Aunt Petunias high, false laugh sounded from the living room. The elf hung his head.\n\u3000\u3000\"Not that I'm not pleased to meet you,\" said Harry quickly, \"but, er, is there any particular reason you're here?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, yes, sir,\" said Dobby earnestly. \"Dobby has come to tell you, sir ... it is difficult, sir ... Dobby wonders where to begin . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Sit down,\" said Harry politely, pointing at the bed.\n\u3000\u3000To his horror, the elf burst into tears - very noisy tears.\n\u3000\u3000\"S-sit down!\" he wailed. \"Never ... never ever. . . \"\n\u3000\u3000Harry thought he heard the voices downstairs falter.\n\u3000\u3000 \"I'm sorry,\" he whispered, \"I didn't mean to offend you or anything -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Offend Dobby!\" choked the elf. \"Dobby has never been asked to sit down by a wizard - like an equal-\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry, trying to say \"Shh!\" and look comforting at the same time, ushered Dobby back onto the bed where he sat hiccoughing, looking like a large and very ugly doll. At last he managed to control himself, and sat with his great eyes fixed on Harry in an expression of watery adoration.\n\u3000\u3000\"You can't have met many decent wizards,\" said Harry, trying to cheer him up.\n\u3000\u3000Dobby shook his head. Then, without warning, he leapt up and started banging his head furiously on the window, shouting, \"Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't - what are you doing?\" Harry hissed, springing up and pulling Dobby back onto the bed - Hedwig had woken up with a particularly loud screech and was beating her wings wildly against the bars of her cage.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dobby had to punish himself, sir,\" said the elf, who had gone slightly cross-eyed. \"Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Your family?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"The wizard family Dobby serves, sir... DOBBY'S is a houseelf - bound to serve one house and one family forever . .....\n\u3000\u3000\"Do they know you're here?\" asked Harry curiously.\n\u3000\u3000Dobby shuddered.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, no, sir, no ... Dobby will have to punish himself most grievously for coming to see you, sir. Dobby will have to shut his ears in the oven door for this. If they ever knew, sir _\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But won't they notice if you shut your ears in the oven door?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Dobby doubts it, sir. Dobby is always having to punish himself for something, sir. They lets Dobby get on with it, sir. Sometimes they reminds me to do extra punishments ......\n\u3000\u3000\"But why don't you leave? Escape?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"A house-elf must be set free, sir. And the family will never set Dobby free ... Dobby will serve the family until he dies, sir . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry stared.\n\u3000\u3000\"And I thought I had it bad staying here for another four weeks,\"\n\u3000\u3000he said. \"This makes the Dursleys sound almost human. Can't anyone help you? Can't I?\"\n\u3000\u3000Almost at once, Harry wished he hadn't spoken. Dobby dissolved again into wails of gratitude.\n\u3000\u3000\"Please,\" Harry whispered frantically, \"please be quiet. If the Dursleys hear anything, if they know you're here -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry Potter asks if he can help Dobby ... Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir, but of your goodness, Dobby never knew . .....\n\u3000\u3000Harry, who was feeling distinctly hot in the face, said, \"Whatever you've heard about my greatness is a load of rubbish. I'm not even top of my year at Hogwarts; that's Hermione, she -\"\n\u3000\u3000But he stopped quickly, because thinking about Hermione was painful.\n\u3000\u3000\"I-Tarry Potter is humble and modest,\" said Dobby reverently, his orb- like eyes aglow. \"Harry Potter speaks not of his triumph over He-Who- Must-Not-Be-Named -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Voldemort?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000Dobby clapped his hands over his bat ears and moaned, \"Ah, speak not the name, sir! Speak not the name!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Sorry\" said Harry quickly. \"I know lots of people don't like it. My friend Ron -\"\n\u3000\u3000He stopped again. Thinking about Ron was painful, too.\n\u3000\u3000Dobby leaned toward Harry, his eyes wide as headlights.\n\u3000\u3000'Dobby heard tell,\" he said hoarsely, \"that Harry Potter met the Dark Lord for a second time just weeks ago ... that Harry Potter escaped Yet again. \"\n\u3000\u3000Harry nodded and Dobby's eyes suddenly shone with tears.\n\u3000\u3000,Ah, sir,\" he gasped, dabbing his face with a corner of the grubby\n\u3000\u3000pillowcase he was wearing. \"Harry Potter is valiant and bold! He has braved so many dangers already! But Dobby has come to protect Harry Potter, to warn him, even if he does have to shut his ears in the oven door later... Harry Potter must notgo back to Hogwarts.\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a silence broken only by the chink of knives and forks from downstairs and the distant rumble of Uncle Vernon's voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"W-what?\" Harry stammered. \"But I've got to go back - term starts on September first. It's all that's keeping me going. You don't know what it's like here. I don't belong here. I belong in your world - at Hogwarts.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No, no, no,\" squeaked Dobby, shaking his head so hard his ears flapped. \"Harry Potter must stay where he is safe. He is too great, too good, to lose. If Harry Potter goes back to Hogwarts, he will be in mortal danger.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Why?\" said Harry in surprise.\n\u3000\u3000\"There is a plot, Harry Potter. A plot to make most terrible things happen at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year,\" whispered Dobby, suddenly trembling all over. \"Dobby has known it for months, sir. Harry Potter must not put himself in peril. He is too important, sir!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What terrible things?\" said Harry at once. \"Who's plotting them?\"\n\u3000\u3000Dobby made a funny choking noise and then banged his head frantically against the wall.\n\u3000\u3000\"All right!\" cried Harry, grabbing the elf's arm to stop him. \"You can't tell me. I understand. But why are you warning me?\" A sudden, unpleasant thought struck him. \"Hang on - this hasn't got anything to do with Vol- - sorry - with You-Know-Who, has it?\n\u3000\u3000You could just shake or nod,\" he added hastily as Dobby's head tilted worryingly close to the wall again.\n\u3000\u3000Slowly, Dobby shook his head.\n\u3000\u3000\"Not -not He- Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, sir ='\n\u3000\u3000But Dobby's eyes were wide and he seemed to be trying to give Harry a hint. Harry, however, was completely lost.\n\u3000\u3000\"He hasn't got a brother, has he?\"\n\u3000\u3000Dobby shook his head, his eyes wider than ever.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well then, I can't think who else would have a chance of making horrible things happen at Hogwarts,\" said Harry. \"I mean, there's Dumbledore, for one thing - you know who Dumbledore is, don't you?\"\n\u3000\u3000 Dobby bowed his head.\n\u3000\u3000\"Albus Dumbledore is the greatest headmaster Hogwarts has ever had. Dobby knows it, sir. Dobby has heard Dumbledore's powers rival those of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named at the height of his strength. But, sir\" - Dobby's voice dropped to an urgent whisper - \"there are powers Dumbledore doesn't ... powers no decent wizard. . .\"\n\u3000\u3000And before Harry could stop him, Dobby bounded off the bed, seized Harry's desk lamp, and started beating himself around the head with earsplitting yelps.\n\u3000\u3000A sudden silence fell downstairs. Two seconds later Harry, heart thudding madly, heard Uncle Vernon coming into the hall, calling, \"Dudley must have left his television on again, the little tyke!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Quick! In the closet!\" hissed Harry, stuffing Dobby in, shutting the door, and flinging himself onto the bed just as the door handle turned.\n\u3000\u3000\"What - the - devil - are - you - doing?\" said Uncle Vernon through gritted teeth, his face horribly close to Harry's. \"You've just ruined the punch line of my Japanese golfer joke .... One more sound and you'll wish you'd never been born, boy!\"\n\u3000\u3000He stomped flat-footed from the room.\n\u3000\u3000Shaking, Harry let Dobby out of the closet.\n\u3000\u3000\"See what it's like here?\" he said. \"See why I've got to go back to Hogwarts? It's the only place I've got -well, I think I've got friends. \"\n\u3000\u3000\"Friends who don't even write to Harry Potter?\" said Dobby slyly.\n\u3000\u3000\"I expect they've just been - wait a minute,\" said Harry, frowning. \"How do you know my friends haven't been writing to me?\"\n\u3000\u3000Dobby shuffled his feet.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry Potter mustn't be angry with Dobby. Dobby did it for the best - \"\n\u3000\u3000\"Have you been stopping my letters?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Dobby has them here, sir,\" said the elf. Stepping nimbly out of Harry's reach, he pulled a thick wad of envelopes from the inside of the pillowcase he was wearing. Harry could make out Hermione's neat writing, Ron's untidy scrawl, and even a scribble that looked as though it was from the Hogwarts gamekeeper, Hagrid.\n\u3000\u3000Dobby blinked anxiously up at Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry Potter mustn't be angry... Dobby hoped ... if Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him ... Harry Potter might not want to go back to school, sir . .....\n\u3000\u3000 Harry wasn't listening. He made a grab for the letters, but Dobby jumped out of reach.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry Potter will have them, sir, if he gives Dobby his word\n\u3000\u3000that he will not return to Hogwarts. Ah, sir, this is a danger you must not face! Say you won't go back, sir!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Harry angrily. \"Give me my friends' letters!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Then Harry Potter leaves Dobby no choice,\" said the elf sadly.\n\u3000\u3000Before Harry could move, Dobby had darted to the bedroom door, pulled it open, and sprinted down the stairs.\n\u3000\u3000Mouth dry, stomach lurching, Harry sprang after him, trying not to make a sound. He jumped the last six steps, landing catlike on the hall carpet, looking around for Dobby. From the dining room he heard Uncle Vernon saying, \". . . tell Petunia that very funny story about those American plumbers, Mr. Mason. She's been dying to hear. . . \"\n\u3000\u3000Harry ran up the hall into the kitchen and felt his stomach disappear.\n\u3000\u3000Aunt Petunia's masterpiece of a pudding, the mountain of cream and sugared violets, was floating up near the ceiling. On top of a cupboard in the corner crouched Dobby.\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" croaked Harry. \"Please ... they'll kill me ......\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry Potter must say he's not going back to school -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Dobby ... please ...\n\u3000\u3000\"Say it, sir -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I can't -\"\n\u3000\u3000Dobby gave him a tragic look.\n\u3000\u3000\"Then Dobby must do it, sir, for Harry Potter's own good.\"\n\u3000\u3000The pudding fell to the floor with a heart-stopping crash. Cream splattered the windows and walls as the dish shattered. With a crack like a whip, Dobby vanished.\n\u3000\u3000There were screams from the dining room and Uncle Vernon\n\u3000\u3000burst into the kitchen to find Harry, rigid with shock, covered from head to foot in Aunt Petunias pudding.\n\u3000\u3000At first, it looked as though Uncle Vernon would manage to gloss the whole thing over. (\"Just our nephew - very disturbed\n\u3000\u3000meeting strangers upsets him, so we kept him upstairs\t) He\n\u3000\u3000shooed the shocked Masons back into the dining room, promised Harry he would flay him to within an inch of his life when the Ma sons had left, and handed him a mop. Aunt Petunia dug some ice cream out of the freezer and Harry, still shaking, started scrubbing the kitchen clean.\n\u3000\u3000Uncle Vernon might still have been able to make his deal - if it hadn't been for the owl.\n\u3000\u3000Aunt Petunia was just passing around a box of after-dinner mints when a huge barn owl swooped through the dining room window, dropped a letter on Mrs. Mason's head, and swooped out again. Mrs. Mason screamed like a banshee and ran from the house shouting about lunatics. Mr. Mason stayed just long enough to tell the Dursleys that his wife was mortally afraid of birds of all shapes and sizes, and to ask whether this was their idea of a joke.\n\u3000\u3000Harry stood in the kitchen, clutching the mop for support, as Uncle Vernon advanced on him, a demonic glint in his tiny eyes.\n\u3000\u3000\"Read it!\" he hissed evilly, brandishing the letter the owl had delivered. \"Go on - read it!\"\n\u3000\u3000 Harry took it. It did not contain birthday greetings.\n\u3000\u3000Dear Mr. Potter,\n\u3000\u3000We have received intelligence that a Hover Charm was used at your place of residence this evening at twelve minutes past nine.\n\u3000\u3000As you know, underage wizards are not permitted to perform spells outside school, and further spellwork on your part may lead to expulsion from said school (Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery, 1875, Paragraph C).\n\u3000\u3000We would also ask you to remember that any magical activity that risks notice by members of the non-magical community (Muggles) is a serious offense under section 13 of the International Confederation of Warlocks' Statute of Secrecy.\n\u3000\u3000Enjoy your holidays! Yours sincerely,\n\u3000\u3000Mafalda Hopkirk\n\u3000\u3000IMPROPER USE OF MAGIC OFFICE\n\u3000\u3000Ministry of Magic\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked up from the letter and gulped.\n\u3000\u3000\"You didn't tell us you weren't allowed to use magic outside school,\" said Uncle Vernon, a mad gleam dancing in his eyes. \"For got to mention it .... Slipped your mind, I daresay .....\n\u3000\u3000He was bearing down on Harry like a great bulldog, all his teeth bared. \"Well, I've got news for you, boy . ... I'm locking you up .... You're never going back to that school ... never ... and if you try and magic yourself out - they'll expel you!\"\n\u3000\u3000And laughing like a maniac, he dragged Harry back upstairs.\n\u3000\u3000Uncle Vernon was as bad as his word. The following morning,\n\u3000\u3000he paid a man to fit bars on Harry's window. He himself fitted a cat- flap in the bedroom door, so that small amounts of food could be pushed inside three times a day. They let Harry out to use the bathroom morning and evening. Otherwise, he was locked in his room around the clock.\n\u3000\u3000Three days later, the Dursleys were showing no sign of relenting, and Harry couldn't see any way out of his situation. He lay on his bed watching the sun sinking behind the bars on the window and wondered miserably what was going to happen to him.\n\u3000\u3000What was the good of magicking himself out of his room if Hogwarts would expel him for doing it? Yet life at Privet Drive had reached an all-time low. Now that the Dursleys knew they weren't going to wake up as fruit bats, he had lost his only weapon. Dobby might have saved Harry from horrible happenings at Hogwarts, but the way things were going, he'd probably starve to death anyway.\n\u3000\u3000The cat-flap rattled and Aunt Petunias hand appeared, pushing a bowl of canned soup into the room. Harry, whose insides were aching with hunger, jumped off his bed and seized it. The soup was stone-cold, but he drank half of it in one gulp. Then he crossed the room to Hedwig's cage and tipped the soggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl into her empty food tray. She ruffled her feathers and gave him a look of deep disgust.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's no good turning your beak up at it - that's all we've got,\" said Harry grimly.\n\u3000\u3000He put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the cat-flap and lay back down on the bed, somehow even hungrier than he had been before the soup.\n\u3000\u3000Supposing he was still alive in another four weeks, what would happen if he didn't turn up at Hogwarts? Would someone be sent to see why he hadn't come back? Would they be able to make the Dursleys let him go?\n\u3000\u3000The room was growing dark. Exhausted, stomach rumbling, mind spinning over the same unanswerable questions, Harry fell into an uneasy sleep.\n\u3000\u3000He dreamed that he was on show in a zoo, with a card reading UNDERAGE WIZARD attached to his cage. People goggled through the bars at him as he lay, starving and weak, on a bed of straw. He saw Dobby's face in the crowd and shouted out, asking for help, but Dobby called, \"Harry Potter is safe there, sir!\" and vanished. Then the Dursleys appeared and Dudley rattled the bars of the cage, laughing at him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Stop it,\" Harry muttered as the rattling pounded in his sore head. \"Leave me alone ... cut it out ... I'm trying to sleep . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000He opened his eyes. Moonlight was shining through the bars on the window. And someone was goggling through the bars at him: a freckle- faced, red-haired, long-nosed someone.\n\u3000\u3000Ron Weasley was outside Harry's window.\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER Three\n\u3000\u3000THE BURROW\n\u3000\u3000Ron.l\" breathed Harry, creeping to the window and pushing it up so they could talk through the bars. \"Ron, how did you - What the -?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry's mouth fell open as the full impact of what he was seeing hit him. Ron was leaning out of the back window of an old turquoise car, which was parked in midair Grinning at Harry from the front seats were Fred and George, Ron's elder twin brothers.\n\u3000\u3000\"All right, Harry?\" asked George.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's been going on?\" said Ron. \"Why haven't you been answering my letters? I've asked you to stay about twelve times, and then Dad came home and said you'd got an official warning for using magic in front of Muggles -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It wasn't me - and how did he know?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He works for the Ministry,\" said Ron. \"You know we're not supposed to do spells outside school -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You should talk,\" said Harry, staring at the floating car.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, this doesn't count,\" said Ron. \"We're only borrowing this. It's Dad's, we didn't enchant it. But doing magic in front of those Muggles you live with -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I told you, I didn't - but it'll take too long to explain now look, can you tell them at Hogwarts that the Dursleys have locked me up and won't let me come back, and obviously I can't magic myself out, because the Ministry'Il think that's the second spell I've done in three days, so -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Stop gibbering,\" said Ron. \"We've come to take you home with us.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But you can't magic me out either -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We don't need to,\" said Ron, jerking his head toward the front seat and grinning. \"You forget who I've got with me.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Tie that around the bars,\" said Fred, throwing the end of a rope to Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"If the Dursleys wake up, I'm dead,\" said Harry as he tied the rope tightly around a bar and Fred revved up the car.\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't worry,\" said Fred, \"and stand back.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry moved back into the shadows next to Hedwig, who seemed to have realized how important this was and kept still and silent. The car revved louder and louder and suddenly, with a crunching noise, the bars were pulled clean out of the window as Fred drove straight up in the air. Harry ran back to the window to see the bars dangling a few feet above the ground. Panting, Ron hoisted them up into the car. Harry listened anxiously, but there was no sound from the Dursleys' bedroom.\n\u3000\u3000When the bars were safely in the back seat with Ron, Fred reversed as close as possible to Harry's window.\n\u3000\u3000\"Get in,\" Ron said.\n\u3000\u3000\"But all my Hogwarts stuff - my wand - my broomstick -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Where is it?\"\n\u3000\u3000 \"Locked in the cupboard under the stairs, and I can't get out of this room -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No problem,\" said George from the front passenger seat. \"Out of the way, Harry.\"\n\u3000\u3000Fred and George climbed catlike through the window into Harry's room. You had to hand it to them, thought Harry, as George took an ordinary hairpin from his pocket and started to pick the lock.\n\u3000\u3000\"A lot of wizards think it's a waste of time, knowing this sort of Muggle trick,\" said Fred, \"but we feel they're skills worth learning, even if they are a bit slow.\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a small click and the door swung open.\n\u3000\u3000\"So - we'll get your trunk - you grab anything you need from your room and hand it out to Ron,\" whispered George.\n\u3000\u3000\"Watch out for the bottom stair - it creaks,\" Harry whispered back as the twins disappeared onto the dark landing.\n\u3000\u3000Harry dashed around his room, collecting his things and passing them out of the window to Ron. Then he went to help Fred and George heave his trunk up the stairs. Harry heard Uncle Vernon cough.\n\u3000\u3000At last, panting, they reached the landing, then carried the trunk through Harry's room to the open window. Fred climbed back into the car to pull with Ron, and Harry and George pushed from the bedroom side. Inch by inch, the trunk slid through the window.\n\u3000\u3000Uncle Vernon coughed again.\n\u3000\u3000\"A bit more,\" panted Fred, who was pulling from inside the car. \"One good push -\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry and George threw their shoulders against the trunk and it slid out of the window into the back seat of the car.\n\u3000\u3000\"Okay, let's go,\" George whispered.\n\u3000\u3000But as Harry climbed onto the windowsill there came a sudden loud screech from behind him, followed immediately by the thunder of Uncle Vernon's voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"THAT RUDDY OWL!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I've forgotten Hedwig!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry tore back across the room as the landing light clicked on - he snatched up Hedwig's cage, dashed to the window, and passed it out to Ron. He was scrambling back onto the chest of drawers when Uncle Vernon hammered on the unlocked door and it crashed open.\n\u3000\u3000For a split second, Uncle Vernon stood framed in the doorway; then he let out a bellow like an angry bull and dived at Harry, grabbing him by the ankle.\n\u3000\u3000Ron, Fred, and George seized Harry's arms and pulled as hard as they could.\n\u3000\u3000\"Petunia!\" roared Uncle Vernon. \"He's getting away! HE'S GETTING AWAY!\"\n\u3000\u3000But the Weasleys gave a gigantic tug and Harry's leg slid out of Uncle Vernon's grasp - Harry was in the car - he'd slammed the door shut\n\u3000\u3000\"Put your foot down, Fred!\" yelled Ron, and the car shot suddenly toward the moon.\n\u3000\u3000Harry couldn't believe it - he was free. He rolled down the\n\u3000\u3000window, the night air whipping his hair, and looked back at the shrinking rooftops of Privet Drive. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley were all hanging, dumbstruck, out of Harry's window.\n\u3000\u3000\"See you next summer!\" Harry yelled.\n\u3000\u3000The Weasleys roared with laughter and Harry settled back in his seat, grinning from ear to ear.\n\u3000\u3000\"Let Hedwig out,\" he told Ron. \"She can fly behind us. She hasn't had a chance to stretch her wings for ages.\"\n\u3000\u3000George handed the hairpin to Ron and, a moment later, Hedwig soared joyfully out of the window to glide alongside them like a ghost.\n\u3000\u3000\"So - what's the story, Harry?\" said Ron impatiently. \"What's been happening?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry told them all about Dobby, the warning he'd given Harry and the fiasco of the violet pudding. There was a long, shocked silence when he had finished.\n\u3000\u3000\"Very fishy,\" said Fred finally.\n\u3000\u3000\"Definitely dodgy\" agreed George. \"So he wouldn't even tell you who's supposed to be plotting all this stuff?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't think he could,\" said Harry. \"I told you, every time he got close to letting something slip, he started banging his head against the wall.\"\n\u3000\u3000He saw Fred and George look at each other.\n\u3000\u3000\"What, you think he was lying to me?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well,\" said Fred, \"put it this way - house-elves have got powerful magic of their own, but they can't usually use it without their master's permission. I reckon old Dobby was sent to stop you com\n\u3000\u3000ing back to Hogwarts. Someone's idea of a joke. Can you think of anyone at school with a grudge against you?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" said Harry and Ron together, instantly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Draco Malfoy,\" Harry explained. \"He hates me.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Draco Malfoy?\" said George, turning around. \"Not Lucius Malfoy's son?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Must be, it's not a very common name, is it?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000 Y.\n\u3000\u3000\"I've heard Dad talking about him,\" said George. \"He was a big supporter of You-Know-Who.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"And when You-Know-Who disappeared,\" said Fred, craning around to look at Harry, \"Lucius Malfoy came back saying he'd never meant any of it. Load of dung - Dad reckons he was right in You- Know-Who's inner circle.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry had heard these rumors about Malfoy's family before, and they didn't surprise him at all. Malfoy made Dudley Dursley look\n\u3000\u3000like a kind, thoughtful, and sensitive boy.\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't know whether the Malfoys own a house-elf\tsaid\n\u3000\u3000Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, whoever owns him will be an old wizarding family, and they'll be rich,\" said Fred.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, Mum's always wishing we had a house-elf to do the ironing,\" said George. \"But all we've got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all over the garden. House-elves come with big old manors and castles and places like that; you wouldn't catch one in our house . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry was silent. Judging by the fact that Draco Malfoy usually had the best of everything, his family was rolling in wizard gold; he\n\u3000\u3000could just see Malfoy strutting around a large manor house. Sending the family servant to stop Harry from going back to Hogwarts also sounded exactly like the sort of thing Malfoy would do. Had Harry been stupid to take Dobby seriously?\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm glad we came to get you, anyway,\" said Ron. \"I was getting really worried when you didn't answer any of my letters. I thought it was Errol's fault at first\n\u3000\u3000-\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Who's Errol?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Our owl. He's ancient. It wouldn't be the first time he'd collapsed on a delivery. So then I tried to borrow Hermes -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Who?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"The owl Mum and Dad bought Percy when he was made prefect,\" said Fred from the front.\n\u3000\u3000\"But Percy wouldn't lend him to me,\" said Ron. \"Said he needed him.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Percy's been acting very oddly this summer,\" said George, frowning. \"And he has been sending a lot of letters and spending a load of time shut up in his room .... I mean, there's only so many times you can polish a prefect badge .... You're driving too far west, Fred,\" he added, pointing at a compass on the dashboard. Fred twiddled the steering wheel.\n\u3000\u3000\"So, does your dad know you've got the car?\" said Harry, guessing the answer.\n\u3000\u3000\"Er, no,\" said Ron, \"he had to work tonight. Hopefully we'll be able to get it back in the garage without Mum noticing we flew it.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What does your dad do at the Ministry of Magic, anyway?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He works in the most boring department,\" said Ron. \"The Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"The what?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It's all to do with bewitching things that are Muggle-made, you know, in case they end up back in a Muggle shop or house. Like, last year, some old witch died and her tea set was sold to an antiques shop. This Muggle woman bought it, took it home, and tried to serve her friends tea in it. It was a nightmare - Dad was working overtime for weeks.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What happened?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"The teapot went berserk and squirted boiling tea all over the place and one man ended up in the hospital with the sugar tongs clamped to his nose. Dad was going frantic - it's only him and an old warlock called Perkins in the office -and they had to do Memory Charms and all sorts of stuff to cover it up -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But your dad - this car -\"\n\u3000\u3000Fred laughed. \"Yeah, Dad's crazy about everything to do with Muggles; our shed's full of Muggle stuff. He takes it apart, puts spells on it, and puts it back together again. If he raided our house he'd have to put himself under arrest. It drives Mum mad.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That's the main road,\" said George, peering down through the windshield. \"We'll be there in ten minutes .... Just as well, it's getting light . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000A faint pinkish glow was visible along the horizon to the east.\n\u3000\u3000Fred brought the car lower, and Harry saw a dark patchwork of fields and clumps of trees.\n\u3000\u3000\"We're a little way outside the village,\" said George. \"Ottery St. Catchpole.\"\n\u3000\u3000Lower and lower went the flying car. The edge of a brilliant red sun was now gleaming through the trees.\n\u3000\u3000\"Touchdown!\" said Fred as, with a slight bump, they hit the ground. They had landed next to a tumbledown garage in a small yard, and Harry looked out for the first time at Ron's house.\n\u3000\u3000It looked as though it had once been a large stone pigpen, but extra rooms had been added here and there until it was several stories high and so crooked it looked as though it were held up by magic (which, Harry reminded himself, it probably was). Four or five chimneys were perched on top of the red roof. A lopsided sign stuck in the ground near the entrance read, THE BuRRow. Around the front door lay a jumble of rubber boots and a very rusty cauldron. Several fat brown chickens were pecking their way around the yard.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's not much,\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's wonderful,\" said Harry happily, thinking of Privet Drive.\n\u3000\u3000They got out of the car.\n\u3000\u3000\"Now, we'll go upstairs really quietly,\" said Fred, \"and wait for Mum to call us for breakfast Then, Ron, you come bounding downstairs going, `Mum, look who turned up in the night!' and she'll be all pleased to see Harry and no one need ever know we flew the car.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Right,\" said Ron. \"Come on, Harry, I sleep at the - at the top\n\u3000\u3000Ron had gone a nasty greenish color, his eyes fixed on the house. The other three wheeled around.\n\u3000\u3000Mrs. Weasley was marching across the yard, scattering chickens, and for a short, plump, kind-faced woman, it was remarkable how much she looked like a saber-toothed tiger.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah, \"said Fred.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, dear,\" said George.\n\u3000\u3000Mrs. Weasley came to a halt in front of them, her hands on her hips, staring from one guilty face to the next. She was wearing a flowered apron with a wand sticking out of the pocket.\n\u3000\u3000\"So, \"she said.\n\u3000\u3000\"Morning, Mum,\" said George, in what he clearly thought was a jaunty, winning voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"Have you any idea how worried I've been?\" said Mrs. Weasley in a deadly whisper.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sorry, Mum, but see, we had to -\"\n\u3000\u3000All three of Mrs. Weasley's sons were taller than she was, but they cowered as her rage broke over them.\n\u3000\u3000\"Beds empty! No note! Cargone - could have crashed - out of my\n\u3000\u3000mind with worry - did you care? - never, as long as I've lived - you wait until your father gets home, we never had trouble like this from Bill or Charlie or Percy -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Perfect Percy,\" muttered Fred.\n\u3000\u3000\"YOU COULD DO WITH TAKING A LEAF OUT OF PERCY'S BOOK!\" yelled Mrs. Weasley, prodding a finger in Fred's chest. \"You could have died, you could have been seen, you could have lost your father his job -\"\n\u3000\u3000It seemed to go on for hours. Mrs. Weasley had shouted herself hoarse before she turned on Harry, who backed away.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm very pleased to see you, Harry, dear,\" she said. \"Come in and have some breakfast.\"\n\u3000\u3000She turned and walked back into the house and Harry, after a nervous glance at Ron, who nodded encouragingly, followed her.\n\u3000\u3000 The kitchen was small and rather cramped. There was a\n\u3000\u3000scrubbed wooden table and chairs in the middle, and Harry sat down on the edge of his seat, looking around. He had never been in a wizard house before.\n\u3000\u3000The clock on the wall opposite him had only one hand and no numbers at all. Written around the edge were things like Time to make tea, Time to feed the chickens, and You're late. Books were stacked three deep on the mantelpiece, books with titles like Charm Your Own Cheese, Enchantment in Baking, and One Minute Feasts - It's Magic! And unless Harry's ears were deceiving him, the old radio next to the sink had just announced that coming up was \"Witching Hour, with the popular singing sorceress, Celestina Warbeck.\"\n\u3000\u3000Mrs. Weasley was clattering around, cooking breakfast a little haphazardly, throwing dirty looks at her sons as she threw sausages into the frying pan. Every now and then she muttered things like \"don't know what you were thinking of,\" and \"never would have believed it.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't blame you, dear,\" she assured Harry, tipping eight or nine sausages onto his plate. \"Arthur and I have been worried about you, too. Just last night we were saying we'd come and get you ourselves if you hadn't written back to Ron by Friday. But really,\" (she was now adding three fried eggs to his plate) \"flying an illegal car halfway across the country - anyone could have seen you -\"\n\u3000\u3000She flicked her wand casually at the dishes in the sink, which began to clean themselves, clinking gently in the background.\n\u3000\u3000\"It was cloudy, Mum!\" said Fred.\n\u3000\u3000\"You keep your mouth closed while you're eating!\" Mrs. Weasley snapped.\n\u3000\u3000\"They were starving him, Mum!\" said George.\n\u3000\u3000\"And you!\" said Mrs. Weasley, but it was with a slightly softened expression that she started cutting Harry bread and buttering it for him.\n\u3000\u3000At that moment there was a diversion in the form of a small, redheaded figure in a long nightdress, who appeared in the kitchen, gave a small squeal, and ran out again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ginny,\" said Ron in an undertone to Harry. \"My sister. She's been talking about you all summer.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, she'll be wanting your autograph, Harry,\" Fred said with a grin, but he caught his mother's eye and bent his face over his plate without another word. Nothing more was said until all four plates were clean, which took a surprisingly short time.\n\u3000\u3000\"Blimey, I'm tired,\" yawned Fred, setting down his knife and fork at last. \"I think I'll go to bed and -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You will not,\" snapped Mrs. Weasley. \"It's your own fault you've been up all night. You're going to de-gnome the garden for me; they're getting completely out of hand again -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, Mum -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"And you two,\" she said, glaring at Ron and Fred. \"You can go up to bed, dear,\" she added to Harry. \"You didn't ask them to fly that wretched car -\"\n\u3000\u3000But Harry, who felt wide awake, said quickly, \"I'll help Ron. I've never seen a de-gnoming -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That's very sweet of you, dear, but it's dull work,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"Now, let's see what Lockhart's got to say on the subject -\"\n\u3000\u3000And she pulled a heavy book from the stack on the mantelpiece. George groaned.\n\u3000\u3000\"Mum, we know how to de-gnome a garden -\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked at the cover of Mrs. Weasley's book. Written across it in fancy gold letters were the words Gilderoy Lockhart's Guide to Household Pests. There was a big photograph on the front of a very good- IOI)king wizard with wavy blond hair and bright blue eyes. As always in the wizarding world, the photograph was moving; the wizard, who Harry supposed was Gilderoy Lockhart, kept winking cheekily up at them all. Mrs. Weasley beamed down at him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, he is marvelous,\" she said. \"He knows his household pests, all right, it's a wonderful book . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Mum fancies him,\" said Fred, in a very audible whisper.\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't be so ridiculous, Fred,\" said Mrs. Weasley, her cheeks rather pink. \"All right, if you think you know better than Lockhart, you can go and get on with it, and woe betide you if there's a single gnome in that garden when I come out to inspect it.\"\n\u3000\u3000Yawning and grumbling, the Weasleys slouched outside with Harry behind them. The garden was large, and in Harry's eyes, exactlY what a garden should be. The Dursleys wouldn't have liked it - there were plenty of weeds, and the grass needed cutting but there were gnarled trees all around the walls, plants Harry had never seen spilling from every flower bed, and a big green pond full of frogs.\n\u3000\u3000\"Muggles have garden gnomes, too, you know,\" Harry told Ron\n\u3000\u3000they crossed the lawn.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, I've seen those things they think are gnomes,\" said Ron, bent double with his head in a peony bush, \"like fat little Santa Clauses with fishing rods . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a violent scuffling noise, the peony bush shuddered, and Ron straightened up. \"This is a gnome,\" he said grimly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Gerroff me! Gerroff me!\" squealed the gnome.\n\u3000\u3000It was certainly nothing like Santa Claus. It was small and leathery looking, with a large, knobby, bald head exactly like a potato. Ron held it at arm's length as it kicked out at him with its horny little feet; he grasped it around the ankles and turned it upside down.\n\u3000\u3000\"This is what you have to do,\" he said. He raised the gnome above his head (\"Gerroff me!\") and started to swing it in great circles like a lasso. Seeing the shocked look on Harry's face, Ron added, \"It doesn't hurt them - you've just got to make them really dizzy so they can't find their way back to the gnomeholes.\"\n\u3000\u3000He let go of the gnome's ankles: It flew twenty feet into the air and landed with a thud in the field over the hedge.\n\u3000\u3000\"Pitiful,\" said Fred. \"I bet I can get mine beyond that stump.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry learned quickly not to feel too sorry for the gnomes. He decided just to drop the first one he caught over the hedge, but the gnome, sensing weakness, sank its razor-sharp teeth into Harry's finger and he had a hard job shaking it off - until\n\u3000\u3000\"Wow, Harry - that must've been fifty feet ......\n\u3000\u3000The air was soon thick with flying gnomes.\n\u3000\u3000\"See, they're not too bright,\" said George, seizing five or six gnomes at once. \"The moment they know the de-gnoming's going on they storm up to have a look. You'd think they'd have learned by now just to stay put.\"\n\u3000\u3000Soon, the crowd of gnomes in the field started walking away in a straggling line, their little shoulders hunched.\n\u3000\u3000\"They'll be back,\" said Ron as they watched the gnomes disappear into the hedge on the other side of the field. \"They love it here .... Dad's too soft with them; he thinks they're funny . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000Just then, the front door slammed.\n\u3000\u3000\"He's back!\" said George. \"Dad's home!\"\n\u3000\u3000They hurried through the garden and back into the house.\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Weasley was slumped in a kitchen chair with his glasses off and his eyes closed. He was a thin man, going bald, but the little hair he had was as red as any of his children's. He was wearing long green robes, which were dusty and travel-worn.\n\u3000\u3000\"What a night,\" he mumbled, groping for the teapot as they all sat down around him. \"Nine raids. Nine! And old Mundungus Fletcher tried to put a hex on me when I had my back turned ......\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Weasley took a long gulp of tea and sighed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Find anything, Dad?\" said Fred eagerly.\n\u3000\u3000\"All I got were a few shrinking door keys and a biting kettle,\" yawned Mr. Weasley. \"There was some pretty nasty stuff that wasn't my department, though. Mortlake was taken away for questioning about some extremely odd ferrets, but that's the Committee on Experimental Charms, thank goodness ......\n\u3000\u3000\"Why would anyone bother making door keys shrink?\" said George.\n\u3000\u3000\"Just Muggle-baiting,\" sighed Mr. Weasley. \"Sell them a key that keeps shrinking to nothing so they can never find it when they need it .... Of course, it's very hard to convict anyone because no Muggle would admit their key keeps shrinking - they'll insist they just keep losing it. Bless them, they'll go to any lengths to ignore magic, even if it's staring them in the face .... But the things our lot have taken to enchanting, you wouldn't believe -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"LIKE CARS, FOR INSTANCE?\"\n\u3000\u3000Mrs. Weasley had appeared, holding a long poker like a sword. Mr. Weasley's eyes jerked open. He stared guiltily at his wife.\n\u3000\u3000\"C-cars, Molly, dear?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes, Arthur, cars,\" said Mrs. Weasley, her eyes flashing. \"Imagine a wizard buying a rusty old car and telling his wife all he wanted to do with it was take it apart to see how it worked, while really he was enchanting it to make it fly.\"\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Weasley blinked.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, dear, I think you'll find that he would be quite within the law to do that, even if - er - he maybe would have done better to, um, tell his wife the truth .... There's a loophole in the law, you'll find .... As long as he wasn't intending to fly the car, the fact that the car could fly wouldn't -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Arthur Weasley, you made sure there was a loophole when you wrote that law!\" shouted Mrs. Weasley. \"Just so you could carry on tinkering with all that Muggle rubbish in your shed! And for your information, Harry arrived this morning in the car you weren't intending to fly!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry?\" said Mr. Weasley blankly. \"Harry who?\"\n\u3000\u3000He looked around, saw Harry, and jumped.\n\u3000\u3000\"Good lord, is it Harry Potter? Very pleased to meet you, Ron's told us so much about -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Your sons flew that car to Harry's house and back last night.\"\n\u3000\u3000shouted Mrs. Weasley. \"What have you got to say about that, eh?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Did you really?\" said Mr. Weasley eagerly. \"Did it go all right? I - I mean,\" he faltered as sparks flew from Mrs. Weasley's eyes, \"that - that was very wrong, boys - very wrong indeed ......\n\u3000\u3000\"Let's leave them to it,\" Ron muttered to Harry as Mrs. Weasley swelled like a bullfrog. \"Come on, I'll show you my bedroom.\"\n\u3000\u3000They slipped out of the kitchen and down a narrow passageway to an uneven staircase, which wound its way, zigzagging up\n\u3000\u3000through the house. On the third landing, a door stood ajar. Harry just caught sight of a pair of bright brown eyes staring at him before it closed with a snap.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ginny,\" said Ron. \"You don't know how weird it is for her to be this shy. She never shuts up normally -\"\n\u3000\u3000They climbed two more flights until they reached a door with peeling paint and a small plaque on it, saying RONALD'S ROOM.\n\u3000\u3000Harry stepped in, his head almost touching the sloping ceiling, and blinked. It was like walking into a furnace: Nearly everything in Ron's room seemed to be a violent shade of orange: the bedspread, the walls, even the ceiling. Then Harry realized that Ron had covered nearly every inch of the shabby wallpaper with posters of the same seven witches and wizards, all wearing bright orange robes, carrying broomsticks, and waving energetically.\n\u3000\u3000\"Your Quidditch team?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"The Chudley Cannons,\" said Ron, pointing at the orange bedspread, which was emblazoned with two giant black C's and a speeding cannonball. \"Ninth in the league.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron's school spellbooks were stacked untidily in a corner, next to a pile of comics that all seemed to feature The Adventures of Martin Miggs, the Mad Muggle. Ron's magic wand was lying on top of a fish tank full of frog spawn on the windowsill, next to his fat gray rat, Scabbers, who was snoozing in a patch of sun.\n\u3000\u3000Harry stepped over a pack of Self-Shuffling playing cards on the floor and looked out of the tiny window. In the field far below he could see a gang of gnomes sneaking one by one back through the Weasleys' hedge. Then he turned to look at Ron, who was watching him almost nervously, as though waiting for his opinion.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's a bit small,\" said Ron quickly. \"Not like that room you had with the Muggles. And I'm right underneath the ghoul in the attic; he's always banging on the pipes and groaning ...... But Harry, grinning widely, said, \"This is the best house I've ever been in.\" Ron's ears went pink. .\n\u3000\u3000 CHAPTER FOUR\n\u3000\u3000AT F L 0 V RR 11 $ H AND BLOTTS\n\u3000\u3000ife at the Burrow was as different as possible from life on Privet Drive. The Dursleys liked everything neat and ordered; the Weasleys' house burst with the strange and unexpected. Harry got a shock the first time he looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantelpiece and it shouted, \"Tuck your shirt in, scruffy!\" The ghoul in the attic howled and dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet, and small explosions from Fred and George's bedroom were considered perfectly normal. What Harry found most unusual about life at Ron's, however, wasn't the talking mirror or the clanking ghoul: It was the fact that everybody there seemed to like him.\n\u3000\u3000Mrs. Weasley fussed over the state of his socks and tried to force him to eat fourth helpings at every meal. Mr. Weasley liked Harry to sit next to him at the dinner table so that he could bombard him with questions about life with Muggles, asking him to explain how things like plugs and the postal service worked.\n\u3000\u300042\n\u3000\u3000\"Fascinating.\" he would say as Harry talked him through using a telephone. \"Ingenious, really, how many ways Muggles have found of getting along without magic.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry heard from Hogwarts one sunny morning about a week after he had arrived at the Burrow. He and Ron went down to breakfast to find Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Ginny already sitting at the kitchen table. The moment she saw Harry, Ginny accidentally knocked her porridge bowl to the floor with a loud clatter. Ginny seemed very prone to knocking things over whenever Harry entered a room. She dived under the table to retrieve the bowl and emerged with her face glowing like the setting sun. Pretending he hadn't noticed this, Harry sat down and took the toast Mrs. Weasley offered him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Letters from school,\" said Mr. Weasley, passing Harry and Ron identical envelopes of yellowish parchment, addressed in green ink. \"Dumbledore already knows you're here, Harry - doesn't miss a trick, that man. You two've got them, too,\" he added, as Fred and George ambled in, still in their pajamas.\n\u3000\u3000For a few minutes there was silence as they all read their letters. Harry's told him to catch the Hogwarts Express as usual from King's Cross station on September first. There was also a list of the new books he'd need for the coming year.\n\u3000\u3000SECOND-YEAR STUDENTS WILL REQUIRE:\n\u3000\u3000The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2\n\u3000\u3000by Miranda Goshawk\n\u3000\u3000Break with a Banshee by Gilderoy Lockhart Gadding with Ghouls by Gilderoy Lockhart Holidays with Hags by Gilderoy Lockhart\n\u3000\u30004 \",3\n\u3000\u3000Travels with Trolls by Gilderoy Lockhart Voyages with Vampires by Gilderoy Lockhart Wanderings with Werewolves by Gilderoy Lockhart Year with the Yeti by Gilderoy Lockhart\n\u3000\u3000Fred, who had finished his own list, peered over at Harry's.\n\u3000\u3000\"You've been told to get all Lockhart's books, too!\" he said. \"The new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher must be a fan - bet it's a witch.\"\n\u3000\u3000At this point, Fred caught his mother's eye and quickly busied himself with the marmalade.\n\u3000\u3000\"That lot won't come cheap,\" said George, with a quick look at his parents. \"Lockhart's books are really expensive ......\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, we'll manage,\" said Mrs. Weasley, but she looked worried. \"I expect we'll be able to pick up a lot of Ginny's things secondhand.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, are you starting at Hogwarts this year?\" Harry asked Ginny.\n\u3000\u3000She nodded, blushing to the roots of her flaming hair, and put her elbow in the butter dish. Fortunately no one saw this except Harry, because just then Ron's elder brother Percy walked in. He was already dressed, his Hogwarts prefect badge pinned to his sweater vest.\n\u3000\u3000\"Morning, all,\" said Percy briskly. \"Lovely day.\"\n\u3000\u3000He sat down in the only remaining chair but leapt up again almost immediately, pulling from underneath him a moulting, gray feather duster - at least, that was what Harry thought it was, until he saw that it was breathing.\n\u3000\u3000* 44\n\u3000\u3000\"Errol!\" said Ron, taking the limp owl from Percy and extracting a letter from under its wing. \"Finally - he's got Hermione's answer. I wrote to her saying we were going to try and rescue you from the Dursleys.\"\n\u3000\u3000He carried Errol to a perch just inside the back door and tried to stand him on it, but Errol flopped straight off again so Ron lay him on the draining board instead, muttering, \"Pathetic.\" Then he ripped open Hermione's letter and read it out loud:\n\u3000\u3000\"`Dear Ron, and Harry if you're there,\n\u3000\u3000\"`I hope everything went all right and that Harry is okay and that you didn't do anything illegal to get him out, Ron, because that would get Harry into trouble, too. I've been really worried and if Harry is all right, will you please let me know at once, but perhaps it would be bet ter if you used a different owl because I think another delivery might finish your one off.\n\u3000\u3000\"'I'm very busy with schoolwork, of course'- How can she be?\" said Ron in horror. \"We're on vacation! - 'and we're going to London next Wednesday to buy my new books. Why don't we meet in Diago n Alley?\n\u3000\u3000\"`Let me know what's happening as soon as you can. Love from Hermione. \"'\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, that fits in nicely, we can go and get all your things then, too,\" said Mrs. Weasley, starting to clear the table. \"What're you all up to today?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry, Ron, Fred, and George were planning to go up the hill to a small paddock the Weasleys owned. It was surrounded by trees that blocked it from view of the village below, meaning that they could practice Quidditch there, as long as they didn't fly too high.\n\u3000\u3000* 4$\n\u3000\u3000They couldn't use real Quidditch balls, which would have been hard to explain if they had escaped and flown away over the village; instead they threw apples for one another to catch. They took turns riding Harry's Nimbus Two Thousand, which was easily the best broom; Ron's old Shooting Star was often outstripped by passing butterflies.\n\u3000\u3000Five minutes later they were marching up the hill, broomsticks over their shoulders. They had asked Percy if he wanted to join them, but he had said he was busy. Harry had only seen Percy at mealtimes so far; he stayed shut in his room the rest of the time.\n\u3000\u3000\"Wish I knew what he was up to,\" said Fred, frowning. \"He's not himself. His exam results came the day before you did; twelve O.WL.s and he hardly gloated at all.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ordinary Wizarding Levels,\" George explained, seeing Harry's puzzled look. \"Bill got twelve, too. If we're not careful, we'll have another Head Boy in the family. I don't think I could stand the shame.\"\n\u3000\u3000Bill was the oldest Weasley brother. He and the next brother, Charlie, had already left Hogwarts. Harry had never met either of them, but knew that Charlie was in Romania studying dragons and Bill in Egypt working for the wizard's bank, Gringotts.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dunno how Mum and Dad are going to afford all our school stuff this year,\" said George after a while. \"Five sets of Lockhart books! And Ginny needs robes and a wand and everything ......\n\u3000\u3000Harry said nothing. He felt a bit awkward. Stored in an underground vault at Gringotts in London was a small fortune that his parents had left him. Of course, it was only in the wizarding world that he had money; you couldn't use Galleons, Sickles, and Knuts\n\u3000\u300046\n\u3000\u3000in Muggle shops. He had never mentioned his Gringotts bank account to the Dursleys; he didn't think their horror of anything connected with magic would stretch to a large pile of gold.\n\u3000\u3000Mrs. Weasley woke them all early the following Wednesday. After a quick half a dozen bacon sandwiches each, they pulled on their coats and Mrs. Weasley took a flowerpot off the kitchen mantelpiece and peered inside.\n\u3000\u3000\"We're running low, Arthur,\" she sighed. \"We'll have to buy some more today... Ah well, guests first! After you, Harry dear!\"\n\u3000\u3000And she offered him the flowerpot.\n\u3000\u3000Harry stared at them all watching him.\n\u3000\u3000\"W-what am I supposed to do?\" he stammered.\n\u3000\u3000\"He's never traveled by Floo powder,\" said Ron suddenly. \"Sorry, Harry, I forgot.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Never?\" said Mr. Weasley. \"But how did you get to Diagon Alley to buy your school things last year?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I went on the Underground -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Really?\" said Mr. Weasley eagerly. \"Were there escapators? How exactly -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Not now, Arthur,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"Floo powder's a lot quicker, dear, but goodness me, if you've never used it before -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He'll be all right, Mum,\" said Fred. \"Harry, watch us first.\"\n\u3000\u3000He took a pinch of glittering powder out of the flowerpot, stepped up to the fire, and threw the powder into the flames.\n\u3000\u3000With a roar, the fire turned emerald green and rose higher than Fred, who stepped right into it, shouted, \"Diagon Alley!\" and vanished.\n\u3000\u3000* 41\n\u3000\u3000\"You must speak clearly, dear,\" Mrs. Weasley told Harry as George dipped his hand into the flowerpot. \"And be sure to get out at the right grate ......\n\u3000\u3000\"The right what?\" said Harry nervously as the fire roared and whipped George out of sight, too.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, there are an awful lot of wizard fires to choose from, you know, but as long as you've spoken clearly -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He'll be fine, Molly, don't fuss,\" said Mr. Weasley, helping himself to Floo powder, too.\n\u3000\u3000\"But, dear, if he got lost, how would we ever explain to his aunt and uncle?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"They wouldn't mind,\" Harry reassured her. \"Dudley would think it was a brilliant joke if I got lost up a chimney, don't worry about that -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well ... all right ... you go after Arthur,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"Now, when you get into the fire, say where you're going\n\u3000\u3000\"And keep your elbows tucked in,\" Ron advised.\n\u3000\u3000\"And your eyes shut,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"The soot -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't fidget,\" said Ron. \"Or you might well fall out of the wrong fireplace -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But don't panic and get out too early; wait until you see Fred and George.\"\n\u3000\u3000Trying hard to bear all this in mind, Harry took a pinch of Floo powder and walked to the edge of the fire. He took a deep breath, scattered the powder into the flames, and stepped forward; the fire felt like a warm breeze; he opened his mouth and immediately swallowed a lot of hot ash.\n\u3000\u3000\"D-Dia-gon Alley,\" he coughed.\n\u3000\u300048\n\u3000\u3000It felt as though he was being sucked down a giant drain. He seemed to be spinning very fast - the roaring in his ears was deafening -he tried to keep his eyes open but the whirl of green flames made him feel sick - something hard knocked his elbow and he tucked it in tightly, still spinning and spinning - now it felt as though cold hands were slapping his face - squinting through his glasses he saw a blurred stream of fireplaces and snatched glimpses of the rooms beyond - his bacon sandwiches were churning inside him - he closed his eyes again wishing it would stop, and then\n\u3000\u3000He fell, face forward, onto cold stone and felt the bridge of his glasses snap.\n\u3000\u3000Dizzy and bruised, covered in soot, he got gingerly to his feet, holding his broken glasses up to his eyes. He was -,cite alone, but where he was, he had no idea. All he could tell was that he was standing in the stone fireplace of what looked like a large, dimly lit wizard's shop - but nothing in here was ever likely to be on a Hogwarts school list.\n\u3000\u3000A glass case nearby held a withered hand on a cushion, a bloodstained pack of cards, and a staring glass eye. Evil-looking masks stared down from the walls, an assortment of human bones lay upon the counter, and rusty, spiked instruments hung from the ceiling. Even worse, the dark, narrow street Harry could see through the dusty shop window was definitely not Diagon Alley.\n\u3000\u3000The sooner he got out of here, the better. Nose still stinging where it had hit the hearth, Harry made his way swiftly and silently toward the door, but before he'd got halfway toward it, two people appeared on the other side of the glass - and one of them was the\n\u3000\u300049\n\u3000\u3000very last person Harry wanted to meet when he was lost, covered in soot, and wearing broken glasses: Draco Malfoy.\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked quickly around and spotted a large black cabinet to his left; he shot inside it and pulled the doors closed, leaving a small crack to peer through. Seconds later, a bell clanged, and Malfoy stepped into the shop.\n\u3000\u3000The man who followed could only be Draco's father. He had the same pale, pointed face and identical cold, gray eyes. Mr. Malfoy crossed the shop, looking lazily at the items on display, and rang a bell on the counter before turning to his son and saying, \"Touch nothing, Draco.\"\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy, who had reached for the glass eye, said, \"I thought you were going to buy me a present.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I said I would buy you a racing broom,\" said his father, drumming his fingers on the counter.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's the good of that if I'm not on the House team?\" said Malfoy, looking sulky and bad-tempered. \"Harry Potter got a Nimbus Two Thousand last year. Special permission from Dumbledore so he could play for Gryffindor. He's not even that good, it's just because he's famous ... famous for having a stupid scar on his forehead . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy bent down to examine a shelf full of skulls.\n\u3000\u3000\". . . everyone thinks he's so smart, wonderful Potter with his scar and his broomstick -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You have told me this at least a dozen times already,\" said Mr. Malfoy, with a quelling look at his son. \"And I would remind you that it is not - prudent - to appear less than fond of Harry Potter, not when most of our kind regard him as the hero who made the Dark Lord disappear - ah, Mr. Borgin.\"\n\u3000\u300050\n\u3000\u3000A stooping man had appeared behind the counter, smoothing his greasy hair back from his face.\n\u3000\u3000\"Mr. Malfoy, what a pleasure to see you again,\" said Mr. Borgin in a voice as oily as his hair. \"Delighted - and young Master Malfoy, too - charmed. How may I be of assistance? I must show you, just in today, and very reasonably priced -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm not buying today, Mr. Borgin, but selling,\" said Mr. Malfoy.\n\u3000\u3000\"Selling?\" The smile faded slightly from Mr. Borgin's face.\n\u3000\u3000\"You have heard, of course, that the Ministry is conducting more raids,\" said Mr. Malfoy, taking a roll of parchment from his inside pocket and unraveling it for Mr. Borgin to read. \"I have a few - ah - items at home that might embarrass me, if the Ministry were to call ......\"\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Borgin fixed a pair of pince-nez to his nose and looked down the list.\n\u3000\u3000\"The Ministry wouldn't presume to trouble you, sir, surely?\"\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Malfoy's lip curled.\n\u3000\u3000\"I have not been visited yet. The name Malfoy still commands a certain respect, yet the Ministry grows ever more meddlesome. There are rumors about a new Muggle Protection Act - no doubt that flea- bitten, Muggle-loving fool Arthur Weasley is behind it\n\u3000\u3000Harry felt a hot surge of anger.\n\u3000\u3000\"- and as you see, certain of these poisons might make it appear -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I understand, sir, of course,\" said Mr. Borgin. \"Let me see. . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Can I have that?\" interrupted Draco, pointing at the withered hand on its cushion.\n\u3000\u300051\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah, the Hand of Glory!\" said Mr. Borgin, abandoning Mr. Malfoy's list and scurrying over to Draco. \"Insert a candle and it gives light only to the holder! Best friend of thieves and plunderers! Your son has fine taste, sir.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I hope my son will amount to more than a thief or a plunderer, Borgin,\" said Mr. Malfoy coldly, and Mr. Borgin said quickly, \"No offense, sir, no offense meant -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Though if his grades don't pick up,\" said Mr. Malfoy, more coldly still, \"that may indeed be all he is fit for -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It's not my fault,\" retorted Draco. \"The teachers all have favorites, that Hermione Granger -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I would have thought you'd be ashamed that a girl of no wizard family beat you in every exam,\" snapped Mr. Malfoy.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ha!\" said Harry under his breath, pleased to see Draco looking both abashed and angry.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's the same all over,\" said Mr. Borgin, in his oily voice. \"Wizard blood is counting for less everywhere -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Not with me,\" said Mr. Malfoy, his long nostrils flaring.\n\u3000\u3000\"No, sir, nor with me, sir,\" said Mr. Borgin, with a deep bow.\n\u3000\u3000\"In that case, perhaps we can return to my list,\" said Mr. Malfoy shortly. \"I am in something of a hurry, Borgin, I have important business elsewhere today -\"\n\u3000\u3000They started to haggle. Harry watched nervously as Draco drew nearer and nearer to his hiding place, examining the objects for sale. Draco paused to examine a long coil of hangman's rope and to read, smirking, the card propped on a magnificent necklace of opals, Caution: Do Not Touch. Cursed - Has Claimed the Lives of Nineteen Muggle Owners to Date.\n\u3000\u3000* 52\n\u3000\u3000Draco turned away and saw the cabinet right in front of him. He walked forward - he stretched out his hand for the handle\n\u3000\u3000\"Done,\" said Mr. Malfoy at the counter. \"Come, Draco -\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry wiped his forehead on his sleeve as Draco turned away.\n\u3000\u3000\"Good day to you, Mr. Borgin. I'll expect you at the manor tomorrow to pick up the goods.\"\n\u3000\u3000The moment the door had closed, Mr. Borgin dropped his oily manner.\n\u3000\u3000\"Good day yourself, Mister Malfoy, and if the stories are true, you haven't sold me half of what's hidden in your manor ......\n\u3000\u3000Muttering darkly, Mr. Borgin disappeared into a back room. Harry waited for a minute in case he came back, then, quietly as he could, slipped out of the cabinet, past the glass cases, and out of the shop door.\n\u3000\u3000Clutching his broken glasses to his face, Harry stared around. He had emerged into a dingy alleyway that seemed to be made up entirely of shops devoted to the Dark Arts. The one he'd just left, Borgin and Burkes, looked like the largest, but opposite was a nasty window display of shrunken heads and, two doors down, a large cage was alive with gigantic black spiders. Two shabby-looking wizards were watching him from the shadow of a doorway, muttering to each other. Feeling jumpy, Harry set off, trying to hold his glasses on straight and hoping against hope he'd be able to find a way out of here.\n\u3000\u3000An old wooden street sign hanging over a shop selling poisonous candles told him he was in Knockturn Alley. This didn't help, as Harry had never heard of such a place. He supposed he hadn't spoken clearly enough through his mouthful of ashes\n\u3000\u3000back in the Weasleys' fire. Trying to stay calm, he wondered what to do.\n\u3000\u3000\"Not lost are you, my dear?\" said a voice in his ear, making him jump.\n\u3000\u3000An aged witch stood in front of him, holding a tray of what looked horribly like whole human fingernails. She leered at him, showing mossy teeth. Harry backed away.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm fine, thanks,\" he said. \"I'm just -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"HARRY! What d'yeh think yer doin' down there?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry's heart leapt. So did the witch; a load of fingernails cascaded down over her feet and she cursed as the massive form of Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, came striding toward them, beetle-black eyes flashing over his great bristling beard.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hagrid!\" Harry croaked in relief. \"I was lost - Floo powder -\"\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid seized Harry by the scruff of the neck and pulled him away from the witch, knocking the tray right out of her hands. Her shrieks followed them all the way along the twisting alleyway out into bright sunlight. Harry saw a familiar, snow-white marble building in the distance - Gringotts Bank. Hagrid had steered him right into Diagon Alley.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yer a mess!\" said Hagrid gruffly, brushing soot off Harry so forcefully he nearly knocked him into a barrel of dragon dung outside an apothecary. \"Skulkin' around Knockturn Alley, I dunno dodgy place, Harry - don' want no one ter see yeh down there -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I realized that,\" said Harry, ducking as Hagrid made to brush him off again. \"I told you, I was lost - what were you doing down there, anyway?\"\n\u3000\u3000* 54\n\u3000\u3000\"I was lookin' fer a Flesh-Eatin' Slug Repellent,\" growled Hagrid. \"They're ruinin' the school cabbages. Yer not on yer own?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm staying with the Weasleys but we got separated,\" Harry explained. \"I've got to go and find them . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000They set off together down the street.\n\u3000\u3000\"How come yeh never wrote back ter me?\" said Hagrid as Harry jogged alongside him (he had to take three steps to every stride of Hagrid's enormous boots). Harry explained all about Dobby and the Dursleys.\n\u3000\u3000\"Lousy Muggles,\" growled Hagrid. \"If I'd've known -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry! Harry! Over here!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked up and saw Hermione Granger standing at the top of the white flight of steps to Gringotts. She ran down to meet them, her bushy brown hair flying behind her.\n\u3000\u3000\"What happened to your glasses? Hello, Hagrid - Oh, it's wonderful to see you two again - Are you coming into Gringotts, Harry?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"As soon as I've found the Weasleys,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeh won't have long ter wait,\" Hagrid said with a grin.\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Hermione looked around: Sprinting up the crowded street were Ron, Fred, George, Percy, and Mr. Weasley.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry,\" Mr. Weasley panted. \"We hoped you'd only gone one\n\u3000\u3000grate too far .\tHe mopped his glistening bald patch. \"Molly's\n\u3000\u3000frantic - she's coming now -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Where did you come out?\" Ron asked.\n\u3000\u3000\"Knockturn Alley,\" said Hagrid grimly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Excellent.\" said Fred and George together.\n\u3000\u3000\"We've never been allowed in,\" said Ron enviously.\n\u3000\u3000*55*\n\u3000\u3000\"I should ruddy well think not,\" growled Hagrid. Mrs. Weasley now came galloping into view, her handbag swing ing wildly in one hand, Ginny just clinging onto the other. \"Oh, Harry - oh, my dear - you could have been any where -\" Gasping for breath she pulled a large clothes brush out of her bag and began sweeping off the soot Hagrid hadn't managed to beat away. Mr. Weasley took Harry's glasses, gave them a tap of his wand, and returned them, good as new. \"Well, gotta be off,\" said Hagrid, who was having his hand wrung by Mrs. Weasley (\"Knockturn Alley! If you hadn't found him, Hagrid!\"). \"See yer at Hogwarts!\" And he strode away, head and shoulders taller than anyone else in the packed street. \"Guess who I saw in Borgin and Burkes?\" Harry asked Ron and Hermione as they climbed the Gringotts steps. \"Malfoy and his fa ther.\" \"Did Lucius Malfoy buy anything?\" said Mr. Weasley sharply behind them. \"No, he was selling =' \"So he's worried,\" said Mr. Weasley with grim satisfaction. \"Oh, I'd love to get Lucius Malfoy for something ...... \"You be careful, Arthur,\" said Mrs. Weasley sharply as they were bowed into the bank by a goblin at the door. \"That family's trou ble. Don't go biting off more than you can chew -\" \"So you don't think I'm a match for Lucius Malfoy?\" said Mr. Weasley indignantly, but he was distracted almost at once by the sight of Hermione's parents, who were standing nervously at the counter that ran all along the great marble hall, waiting for Hermione to introduce them.\n\u3000\u3000,5 s\n\u3000\u3000\"But you're Muggles!\" said Mr. Weasley delightedly. \"We must have a drink! What's that you've got there? Oh, you're changing Muggle money. Molly, look!\" He pointed excitedly at the tenpound notes in Mr. Granger's hand.\n\u3000\u3000\"Meet you back here,\" Ron said to Hermione as the Weasleys and Harry were led off to their underground vaults by another Gringotts goblin.\n\u3000\u3000The vaults were reached by means of small, goblin-driven carts that sped along miniature train tracks through the bank's underground tunnels. Harry enjoyed the breakneck journey down to the Weasleys' vault, but felt dreadful, far worse than he had in Knockturn Alley, when it was opened. There was a very small pile of silver Sickles inside, and just one gold Galleon. Mrs. Weasley felt right into the corners before sweeping the whole lot into her bag. Harry felt even worse when they reached his vault. He tried to block the contents from view as he hastily shoved handfuls of coins into a leather bag.\n\u3000\u3000Back outside on the marble steps, they all separated. Percy muttered vaguely about needing a new quill. Fred and George had spotted their friend from Hogwarts, Lee Jordan. Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were going to a secondhand robe shop. Mr. Weasley was insisting on taking the Grangers off to the Leaky Cauldron for a drink.\n\u3000\u3000\"We'll all meet at Flourish and Blotts in an hour to buy your schoolbooks,\" said Mrs. Weasley, setting off with Ginny. \"And not one step down Knockturn Alley!\" she shouted at the twins' retreating backs.\n\u3000\u3000Harry, Ron, and Hermione strolled off along the winding, cobbled street. The bag of gold, silver, and bronze jangling cheerfully\n\u3000\u3000*57*\n\u3000\u3000in Harry's pocket was clamoring to be spent, so he bought three large strawberry-and-peanut-butter ice creams, which they slurped happily as they wandered up the alley, examining the fascinating shop windows. Ron gazed longingly at a full set of Chudley Can non robes in the windows of Quality Quidditch Supplies until Hermione dragged them off to buy ink and parchment next door. In Gambol and Japes Wizarding Joke Shop, they met Fred, George, and Lee Jordan, who were stocking up on Dr. Filibuster's Fabulous Wet-Start, No-Heat Fireworks, and in a tiny junk shop full of bro ken wands, lopsided brass scales, and old cloaks covered in potion stains they found Percy, deeply immersed in a small and deeply boring book called Prefects Who Gained Power. `A study of Hogwarts prefects and their later careers, \" Ron read aloud off the back cover. \"That sounds fascinating . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Go away,\" Percy snapped. \"'Course, he's very ambitious, Percy, he's got it all planned out .... He wants to be Minister of Magic. . . \" Ron told Harry and Hermione in an undertone as they left Percy to it. An hour later, they headed for Flourish and Blotts. They were by no means the only ones making their way to the bookshop. As they approached it, they saw to their surprise a large crowd jostling out side the doors, trying to get in. The reason for this was proclaimed\n\u3000\u3000by a large banner stretched across the upper windows:\n\u3000\u3000GILDEROY LOCKHART will be signing copies of his autobiography MAGICAL ME today 12:30 P.m. to 4:30 P.m.\n\u3000\u3000\"We can actually meet him!\" Hermione squealed. \"I mean, he's written almost the whole booklist!\"\n\u3000\u3000The crowd seemed to be made up mostly of witches around Mrs. Weasley's age. A harrassed-looking wizard stood at the door, saying, \"Calmly, please, ladies .... Don't push, there ... mind the books, now . . . . \"\n\u3000\u3000Harry, Ron, and Hermione squeezed inside. A long line wound right to the back of the shop, where Gilderoy Lockhart was signing his books. They each grabbed a copy of The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2 and sneaked up the line to where the rest of the Weasleys were standing with Mr. and Mrs. Granger.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, there you are, good,\" said Mrs. Weasley. She sounded breathless and kept patting her hair. \"We'll be able to see him in a minute ......\n\u3000\u3000Gilderoy Lockhart came slowly into view, seated at a table surrounded by large pictures of his own face, all winking and flashing dazzlingly white teeth at the crowd. The real Lockhart was wearing robes of forget-me-not blue that exactly matched his eyes; his pointed wizard's hat was set at a jaunty angle on his wavy hair.\n\u3000\u3000A short, irritable-looking man was dancing around taking photographs with a large black camera that emitted puffs of purple smoke with every blinding flash.\n\u3000\u3000\"Out of the way, there,\" he snarled at Ron, moving back to get a better shot. \"This is for the Daily Prophet -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Big deal,\" said Ron, rubbing his foot where the photographer had stepped on it.\n\u3000\u3000Gilderoy Lockhart heard him. He looked up. He saw Ron\n\u3000\u3000*59*\n\u3000\u3000and then he saw Harry. He stared. Then he leapt to his feet and positively shouted, \"It can't be Harry Potter?\"\n\u3000\u3000The crowd parted, whispering excitedly; Lockhart dived forward, seized Harry's arm, and pulled him to the front. The crowd burst into applause. Harry's face burned as Lockhart shook his hand for the photographer, who was clicking away madly, wafting thick smoke over the Weasleys.\n\u3000\u3000\"Nice big smile, Harry,\" said Lockhart, through his own gleaming teeth. \"Together, you and I are worth the front page.\"\n\u3000\u3000When he finally let go of Harry's hand, Harry could hardly feel his fingers. He tried to sidle back over to the Weasleys, but Lockhart threw an arm around his shoulders and clamped him tightly to his side.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he said loudly, waving for quiet. \"What an extraordinary moment this is! The perfect moment for me to make a little announcement I've been sitting on for some time!\n\u3000\u3000\"When young Harry here stepped into Flourish and Blotts today, he only wanted to buy my autobiography -which I shall be happy to present him now, free of charge-\" The crowd applauded again. \"He had no idea,\" Lockhart continued, giving Harry a little shake that made his glasses slip to the end of his nose, \"that he would shortly be getting much, much more than my book, Magical Me. He and his schoolmates will, in fact, be getting the real magical me. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I have great pleasure and pride in announcing that this September, I will be taking up the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!\"\n\u3000\u3000The crowd cheered and clapped and Harry found himself being\n\u3000\u300060\n\u3000\u3000presented with the entire works of Gilderoy Lockhart. Staggering slightly under their weight, he managed to make his way out of the limelight to the edge of the room, where Ginny was standing next to her new cauldron.\n\u3000\u3000\"You have these,\" Harry mumbled to her, tipping the books into the cauldron. \"I'll buy my own -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Bet you loved that, didn't you, Potter?\" said a voice Harry had no trouble recognizing. He straightened up and found himself face-to-face with Draco Malfoy, who was wearing his usual sneer.\n\u3000\u3000\"Famous Harry Potter,\" said Malfoy. \"Can't even go into a bookshop without making the front page.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Leave him alone, he didn't want all that!\" said Ginny. It was the first time she had spoken in front of Harry. She was glaring at Malfoy.\n\u3000\u3000\"Potter, you've got yourself a girlfriend!\" drawled Malfoy. Ginny went scarlet as Ron and Hermione fought their way over, both clutching stacks of Lockhart's books.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, it's you,\" said Ron, looking at Malfoy as if he were something unpleasant on the sole of his shoe. \"Bet you're surprised to see Harry here, eh?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Not as surprised as I am to see you in a shop, Weasley,\" retorted Malfoy. \"I suppose your parents will go hungry for a month to pay for all those.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron went as red as Ginny. He dropped his books into the cauldron, too, and started toward Malfoy, but Harry and Hermione grabbed the back of his jacket.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron!\" said Mr. Weasley, struggling over with Fred and George. \"What are you doing? It's too crowded in here, let's go outside.\"\n\u3000\u300061\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, well, well - Arthur Weasley.\"\n\u3000\u3000It was Mr. Malfoy. He stood with his hand on Draco's shoulder, sneering in just the same way.\n\u3000\u3000\"Lucius,\" said Mr. Weasley, nodding coldly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Busy time at the Ministry, I hear,\" said Mr. Malfoy. \"All those raids ... I hope they're paying you overtime?\"\n\u3000\u3000He reached into Ginny's cauldron and extracted, from amid the glossy Lockhart books, a very old, very battered copy of A Beginner's Guide to Transfiguration.\n\u3000\u3000\"Obviously not,\" Mr. Malfoy said. \"Dear me, what's the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don't even pay you well for it?\"\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Weasley flushed darker than either Ron or Ginny.\n\u3000\u3000\"We have a very different idea of what disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy,\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000\"Clearly,\" said Mr. Malfoy, his pale eyes straying to Mr. and Mrs. Granger, who were watching apprehensively. \"The company you keep, Weasley ... and I thought your family could sink no lower ='\n\u3000\u3000There was a thud of metal as Ginny's cauldron went flying; Mr. Weasley had thrown himself at Mr. Malfoy, knocking him backward into a bookshelf. Dozens of heavy spellbooks came thundering down on all their heads; there was a yell of, \"Get him, Dad!\" from Fred or George; Mrs. Weasley was shrieking, \"No, Arthur, no!\"; the crowd stampeded backward, knocking more shelves over; \"Gentlemen, please - please!\" cried the assistant, and then, louder than all\n\u3000\u3000\"Break it up, there, gents, break it up -\"\n\u3000\u300062\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid was wading toward them through the sea of books. In an instant he had pulled Mr. Weasley and Mr. Malfoy apart. Mr. Weasley had a cut lip and Mr. Malfoy had been hit in the eye by an Encyclopedia of Toadstools. He was still holding Ginny's old Transfiguration book. He thrust it at her, his eyes glittering with malice.\n\u3000\u3000\"Here, girl - take your book - it's the best your father can give you -\" Pulling himself out of Hagrid's grip he beckoned to Draco and swept from the shop.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeh should've ignored him, Arthur,\" said Hagrid, almost lifting Mr. Weasley off his feet as he straightened his robes. \"Rotten ter the core, the whole family, everyone knows that - no Malfoy's worth listenin' ter - bad blood, that's what it is - come on now - let's get outta here.\"\n\u3000\u3000The assistant looked as though he wanted to stop them leaving, but he barely came up to Hagrid's waist and seemed to think better of it. They hurried up the street, the Grangers shaking with fright and Mrs. Weasley beside herself with fury.\n\u3000\u3000\"A fine example to set for your children . . . brawling in public . . . what Gilderoy Lockhart must've thought -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He was pleased,\" said Fred. \"Didn't you hear him as we were leaving? He was asking that bloke from the Daily Prophet if he'd be able to work the fight into his report - said it was all publicity -\"\n\u3000\u3000But it was a subdued group that headed back to the fireside in the Leaky Cauldron, where Harry, the Weasleys, and all their shopping would be traveling back to the Burrow using Floo powder. They said good-bye to the Grangers, who were leaving the pub for the Muggle street on the other side; Mr. Weasley started to ask\n\u3000\u300063\n\u3000\u3000them how bus stops worked, but stopped quickly at the look on Mrs. Weasley's face.\n\u3000\u3000Harry took off his glasses and put them safely in his pocket before helping himself to Floo powder. It definitely wasn't his favorite way to travel.\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER F I v E\n\u3000\u3000THE WHOMPING\n\u3000\u3000WILLOW\n\u3000\u3000he end of the summer vacation came too quickly for Harry's liking. He was looking forward to getting back to Hogwarts, but his month at the Burrow had been the happiest of his life. It was difficult not to feel jealous of Ron when he thought of the Dursleys and the sort of welcome he could expect next time he turned up on Privet Drive.\n\u3000\u3000On their last evening, Mrs. Weasley conjured up a sumptuous dinner that included all of Harry's favorite things, ending with a mouthwatering treacle pudding. Fred and George rounded off the evening with a display of Filibuster fireworks; they fiIled the kitchen with red and blue stars that bounced from ceiling to wall for at least half an hour. Then it was time for a last mug of hot chocolate and bed.\n\u3000\u3000It took a long while to get started next morning. They were up at dawn, but somehow they still seemed to have a great deal to do.\n\u3000\u300065\n\u3000\u3000Mrs. Weasley dashed about in a bad mood looking for spare socks and quills; people kept colliding on the stairs, half-dressed with bits of toast in their hands; and Mr. Weasley nearly broke his neck, tripping over a stray chicken as he crossed the yard carrying Ginny's trunk to the car.\n\u3000\u3000Harry couldn't see how eight people, six large trunks, two owls, and a rat were going to fit into one small Ford Anglia. He had reckoned, of course, without the special features that Mr. Weasley had added.\n\u3000\u3000\"Not a word to Molly,\" he whispered to Harry as he opened the. trunk and showed him how it had been magically expanded so that the luggage fitted easily.\n\u3000\u3000When at last they were all in the car, Mrs. Weasley glanced into the back seat, where Harry, Ron, Fred, George, and Percy were all sitting comfortably side by side, and said, \"Muggles do know more than we give them credit for, don't they?\" She and Ginny got into the front seat, which had been stretched so that it resembled a park bench. \"I mean, you'd never know it was this roomy from the outside, would you?\"\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Weasley started up the engine and they trundled out of the yard, Harry turning back for a last look at the house. He barely had time to wonder when he'd see it again when they were back George had forgotten his box of Filibuster fireworks. Five minutes after that, they skidded to a halt in the yard so that Fred could run in for his broomstick. They had almost reached the highway when Ginny shrieked that she'd left her diary. By the time she had clambered back into the car, they were running very late, and tempers were running high.\n\u3000\u3000* 66\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Weasley glanced at his watch and then at his wife.\n\u3000\u3000\"Molly, dear -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No, Arthur -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No one would see - this little button here is an Invisibility Booster I installed - that'd get us up in the air - then we fly above the clouds. We'd be there in ten minutes and no one would be any the wiser -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I said no, Arthur, not in broad daylight -\"\n\u3000\u3000They reached King's Cross at a quarter to eleven. Mr. Weasley dashed across the road to get trolleys for their trunks and they all hurried into the station.\n\u3000\u3000Harry had caught the Hogwarts Express the previous year. The tricky part was getting onto platform nine and three-quarters, which wasn't visible to the Muggle eye. What you had to do was walk through the solid barrier dividing platforms nine and ten. It didn't hurt, but it had to be done carefully so that none of the Muggles noticed you vanishing.\n\u3000\u3000\"Percy first,\" said Mrs. Weasley, looking nervously at the clock overhead, which showed they had only five minutes to disappear casually through the barrier.\n\u3000\u3000Percy strode briskly forward and vanished. Mr. Weasley went next; Fred and George followed.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll take Ginny and you two come right after us,\" Mrs. Weasley told Harry and Ron, grabbing Ginny's hand and setting off. In the blink of an eye they were gone.\n\u3000\u3000\"Let's go together, we've only got a minute,\" Ron said to Harry.\n\u3000\u3000Harry made sure that Hedwig's cage was safely wedged on top of his trunk and wheeled his trolley around to face the barrier. He felt\n\u3000\u300061\n\u3000\u3000perfectly confident; this wasn't nearly as uncomfortable as using Floo powder. Both of them bent low over the handles of their trolleys and walked purposefully toward the barrier, gathering speed. A few feet away from it, they broke into a run and\n\u3000\u3000CRASH.\n\u3000\u3000Both trolleys hit the barrier and bounced backward; Ron's trunk fell off with a loud thump, Harry was knocked off his feet, and Hedwig's cage bounced onto the shiny floor, and she rolled away, shrieking indignantly; people all around them stared and a guard nearby yelled, \"What in blazes d'you think you're doing?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Lost control of the trolley,\" Harry gasped, clutching his ribs as he got up. Ron ran to pick up Hedwig, who was causing such a scene that there was a lot of muttering about cruelty to animals from the surrounding crowd.\n\u3000\u3000\"Why can't we get through?\" Harry hissed to Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"I dunno -\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron looked wildly around. A dozen curious people were still watching them.\n\u3000\u3000\"We're going to miss the train,\" Ron whispered. \"I don't understand why the gateway's sealed itself -\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked up at the giant clock with a sickening feeling in the pit of his stomach. Ten seconds ... nine seconds ...\n\u3000\u3000He wheeled his trolley forward cautiously until it was right against the barrier and pushed with all his might. The metal remained solid.\n\u3000\u3000Three seconds . . . two seconds ... one second ...\n\u3000\u3000\"It's gone,\" said Ron, sounding stunned. \"The train's left. What if Mum and Dad can't get back through to us? Have you got any Muggle money?\"\n\u3000\u300068\n\u3000\u3000And they marched off through the crowd of curious Muggles, out of the station and back onto the side road where the old Ford Anglia was parked.\n\u3000\u3000Ron unlocked the cavernous trunk with a series of taps from his wand. They heaved their luggage back in, put Hedwig on the back seat, and got into the front.\n\u3000\u3000\"Check that no one's watching,\" said Ron, starting the ignition with another tap of his wand. Harry stuck his head out of the window: Traffic was rumbling along the main road ahead, but their street was empty.\n\u3000\u3000\"Okay,\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000Ron pressed a tiny silver button on the dashboard. The car around them vanished - and so did they. Harry could feel the seat vibrating beneath him, hear the engine, feel his hands on his knees and his glasses on his nose, but for all he could see, he had become a pair of eyeballs, floating a few feet above the ground in a dingy street full of parked cars.\n\u3000\u3000\"Let's go,\" said Ron's voice from his right.\n\u3000\u3000And the ground and the dirty buildings on either side fell away, dropping out of sight as the car rose; in seconds, the whole of London lay, smoky and glittering, below them.\n\u3000\u3000Then there was a popping noise and the car, Harry, and Ron reappeared.\n\u3000\u3000\"Uh-oh,\" said Ron, jabbing at the Invisibility Booster. \"It's faulty -\"\n\u3000\u3000Both of them pummeled it. The car vanished. Then it flickered back again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hold on!\" Ron yelled, and he slammed his foot on the acceler\n\u3000\u3000* 7 0\n\u3000\u3000ator; they shot straight into the low, woolly clouds and everything turned dull and foggy.\n\u3000\u3000\"Now what?\" said Harry, blinking at the solid mass of cloud pressing in on them from all sides.\n\u3000\u3000\"We need to see the train to know what direction to go in,\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dip back down again - quickly -\"\n\u3000\u3000They dropped back beneath the clouds and twisted around in their seats, squinting at the ground.\n\u3000\u3000\"I can see it!\" Harry yelled. \"Right ahead - there!\"\n\u3000\u3000The Hogwarts Express was streaking along below them like a scarlet snake.\n\u3000\u3000\"Due north,\" said Ron, checking the compass on the dashboard. \"Okay, we'll just have to check on it every half hour or so - hold on\n\u3000\u3000And they shot up through the clouds. A minute later, they burst out into a blaze of sunlight.\n\u3000\u3000It was a different world. The wheels of the car skimmed the sea of fluffy cloud, the sky a bright, endless blue under the blinding white sun.\n\u3000\u3000\"All we've got to worry about now are airplanes,\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000They looked at each other and started to laugh; for a long time, they couldn't stop.\n\u3000\u3000It was as though they had been plunged into a fabulous dream. This, thought Harry, was surely the only way to travel - past swirls and turrets of snowy cloud, in a car full of hot, bright sunlight, with a fat pack of toffees in the glove compartment, and the prospect of seeing Fred's and George's jealous faces when they\n\u3000\u3000* 71\n\u3000\u3000landed smoothly and spectacularly on the sweeping lawn in front of Hogwarts castle.\n\u3000\u3000They made regular checks on the train as they flew farther and farther north, each dip beneath the clouds showing them a different view. London was soon far behind them, replaced by neat green fields that gave way in turn to wide, purplish moors, a great city alive with cars like multicolored ants, villages with tiny toy churches.\n\u3000\u3000Several uneventful hours later, however, Harry had to admit that some of the fun was wearing off. The toffees had made them extremely thirsty and they had nothing to drink. He and Ron had pulled off their sweaters, but Harry's T-shirt was sticking to the back of his seat and his glasses kept sliding down to the end of his sweaty nose. He had stopped noticing the fantastic cloud shapes now and was thinking longingly of the train miles below, where you could buy ice-cold pumpkin juice from a trolley pushed by a plump witch. Why hadn't they been able to get onto platform nine and three-quarters?\n\u3000\u3000\"Can't be much further, can it?\" croaked Ron, hours later still, as the sun started to sink into their floor of cloud, staining it a deep pink. \"Ready for another check on the train?\"\n\u3000\u3000It was still right below them, winding its way past a snowcapped mountain. It was much darker beneath the canopy of clouds.\n\u3000\u3000Ron put his foot on the accelerator and drove them upward again, but as he did so, the engine began to whine.\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron exchanged nervous glances.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's probably just tired,\" said Ron. \"It's never been this far before ......\n\u3000\u300012\n\u3000\u3000And they both pretended not to notice the whining growing louder and louder as the sky became steadily darker. Stars were blossoming in the blackness. Harry pulled his sweater back on, try ing to ignore the way the windshield wipers were now waving fee bly, as though in protest. \"Not far,\" said Ron, more to the car than to Harry, \"not far now,\" and he patted the dashboard nervously. When they flew back beneath the clouds a little while later, they had to squint through the darkness for a landmark they knew. \"There!\" Harry shouted, making Ron and Hedwig jump. \"Straight ahead!\" Silhouetted on the dark horizon, high on the cliff over the lake, stood the many turrets and towers of Hogwarts castle. But the car had begun to shudder and was losing speed. \"Come on,\" Ron said cajolingly, giving the steering wheel a lit tle shake, \"nearly there, come on -\" The engine groaned. Narrow jets of steam were issuing from un der the hood. Harry found himself gripping the edges of his seat very hard as they flew toward the lake. The car gave a nasty wobble. Glancing out of his window, Harry saw the smooth, black, glassy surface of the water, a mile below. Ron's knuckles were white on the steering wheel. The car wobbled again. \"Come on,\" Ron muttered. They were over the lake - the castle was right ahead - Ron put his foot down. There was a loud clunk, a splutter, and the engine died com pletely.\n\u3000\u3000\"Uh-oh,\" said Ron, into the silence.\n\u3000\u3000The nose of the car dropped. They were falling, gathering speed, heading straight for the solid castle wall.\n\u3000\u3000\"Noooooo!\" Ron yelled, swinging the steering wheel around; they missed the dark stone wall by inches as the car turned in a great arc, soaring over the dark greenhouses, then the vegetable patch, and then out over the black lawns, losing altitude all the time.\n\u3000\u3000Ron let go of the steering wheel completely and pulled his wand out of his back pocket\n\u3000\u3000\"STOP! STOP!\" he yelled, whacking the dashboard and the windshield, but they were still plummeting, the ground flying up toward them\n\u3000\u3000\"WATCH OUT FOR THAT TREE!\" Harry bellowed, lunging for the steering wheel, but too late.\n\u3000\u3000CRUNCH.\n\u3000\u3000With an earsplitting bang of metal on wood, they hit the thick tree trunk and dropped to the ground with a heavy jolt. Steam was billowing from under the crumpled hood; Hedwig was shrieking in terror; a golfball-size lump was throbbing on Harry's head where he had hit the windshield; and to his right, Ron let out a low, despairing groan.\n\u3000\u3000\"Are you okay?\" Harry said urgently.\n\u3000\u3000\"My wand,\" said Ron, in a shaky voice. \"Look at my wand -\"\n\u3000\u3000It had snapped, almost in two; the tip was dangling limply, held on by a few splinters.\n\u3000\u3000Harry opened his mouth to say he was sure they'd be able to mend it up at the school, but he never even got started. At that very moment, something hit his side of the car with the force of a\n\u3000\u3000* Y4 *\n\u3000\u3000charging bull, sending him lurching sideways into Ron, just as an equally heavy blow hit the roof.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's happen -?\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron gasped, staring through the windshield, and Harry looked around just in time to see a branch as thick as a python smash into it. The tree they had hit was attacking them. Its trunk was bent almost double, and its gnarled boughs were pummeling every inch of the car it could reach.\n\u3000\u3000\"Aaargh!\" said Ron as another twisted limb punched a large dent into his door; the windshield was now trembling under a hail of blows from knuckle-like twigs and a branch as thick as a battering ram was pounding furiously on the roof, which seemed to be caving\n\u3000\u3000\"Run for it!\" Ron shouted, throwing his full weight against his door, but next second he had been knocked backward into Harry's lap by a vicious uppercut from another branch.\n\u3000\u3000\"We're done for!\" he moaned as the ceiling sagged, but suddenly the floor of the car was vibrating - the engine had restarted.\n\u3000\u3000\"Reverse!\" Harry yelled, and the car shot backward; the tree was still trying to hit them; they could hear its roots creaking as it almost ripped itself up, lashing out at them as they sped out of reach.\n\u3000\u3000\"That,\" panted Ron, \"was close. Well done, car -\"\n\u3000\u3000 The car, however, had reached the end of its tether. With two sharp clunks, the doors flew open and Harry felt his seat tip sideways: Next thing he knew he was sprawled on the damp ground. Loud thuds told him that the car was ejecting their luggage from the trunk; Hedwig's cage flew through the air and burst open; she rose out of it with an angry screech and sped off toward the castle\n\u3000\u3000Y5\n\u3000\u3000without a backward look. Then, dented, scratched, and steaming, the car rumbled off into the darkness, its rear lights blazing angrily.\n\u3000\u3000\"Come back!\" Ron yelled after it, brandishing his broken wand. \"Dad'll kill me!\"\n\u3000\u3000But the car disappeared from view with one last snort from its exhaust.\n\u3000\u3000\"Can you believe our luck?\" said Ron miserably, bending down to pick up Scabbers. \"Of all the trees we could've hit, we had to get one that hits back.\"\n\u3000\u3000He glanced over his shoulder at the ancient tree, which was still flailing its branches threateningly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Come on,\" said Harry wearily, \"we'd better get up to the school ......\n\u3000\u3000It wasn't at all the triumphant arrival they had pictured. Stiff, cold, and bruised, they seized the ends of their trunks and began dragging them up the grassy slope, toward the great oak front doors.\n\u3000\u3000\"I think the feast's already started,\" said Ron, dropping his trunk at the foot of the front steps and crossing quietly to look through a brightly lit window. \"Hey - Harry - come and look - it's the Sorting!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry hurried over and, together, he and Ron peered in at the Great Hall.\n\u3000\u3000Innumerable candles were hovering in midair over four long, crowded tables, making the golden plates and goblets sparkle. Overhead, the bewitched ceiling, which always mirrored the sky outside, sparkled with stars.\n\u3000\u3000Through the forest of pointed black Hogwarts hats, Harry saw a long line of scared-looking first years fiIing into the Hall. Ginny\n\u3000\u3000* 76\n\u3000\u3000was among them, easily visible because of her vivid Weasley ha-ir. Meanwhile, Professor McGonagall, a bespectacled witch with her hair in a tight bun, was placing the famous Hogwarts Sorting Hat on a stool before the newcomers.\n\u3000\u3000Every year, this aged old hat, patched, frayed, and dirty, sorted new students into the four Hogwarts houses (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin). Harry well remembered putting it on, exactly one year ago, and waiting, petrified, for its decision as it muttered aloud in his ear. For a few horrible seconds he had feared that the hat was going to put him in Slytherin, the house that had turned out more Dark witches and wizards than any other -but he had ended up in Gryffindor, along with Ron, Hermione, and the rest of the Weasleys. Last term, Harry and Ron had helped Gryffindor win the House Championship, beating Slytherin for the first time in seven years.\n\u3000\u3000A very small, mousy-haired boy had been called forward to place the hat on his head. Harry's eyes wandered past him to where Professor Dumbledore, the headmaster, sat watching the Sorting from the staff table, his long silver beard and half-moon glasses shining brightly in the candlelight. Several seats along, Harry saw Gilderoy Lockhart, dressed in robes of aquamarine. And there at the end was Hagrid, huge and hairy, drinking deeply from his goblet.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hang on. . . \" Harry muttered to Ron. \"There's an empty chair at the staff table .... Where's Snape?\"\n\u3000\u3000Professor Severus Snape was Harry's least favorite teacher. Harry also happened to be Snape's least favorite student. Cruel, sarcastic, and disliked by everybody except the students from his own house (Slytherin), Snape taught Potions.\n\u3000\u3000\"Maybe he's ill!\" said Ron hopefully.\n\u3000\u3000\"Maybe he's left,\" said Ha-rry, \"because he missed out on the Defense Against Dark Arts job again!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Or he might have been sacked!\" said Ron enthusiastically. \"I mean, everyone hates him -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Or maybe,\" said a very cold voice right behind them, \"he's waiting to hear why you two didn't arrive on the school train.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry spun around. There, his black robes rippling in a cold breeze, stood Severus Snape. He was a thin man with sallow skin, a hooked nose, and greasy, shoulder-length black hair, and at this moment, he was smiling in a way that told Harry he and Ron were in very deep trouble.\n\u3000\u3000\"Follow me,\" said Snape.\n\u3000\u3000Not daring even to look at each other, Harry and Ron followed Snape up the steps into the vast, echoing entrance hall, which was lit with flaming torches. A delicious smell of food was wafting from the Great Hall, but Snape led them away from the warmth and light, down a narrow stone staircase that led into the dungeons.\n\u3000\u3000\"In!\" he said, opening a door halfway down the cold passageway and pointing.\n\u3000\u3000They entered Snape's office, shivering. The shadowy walls were lined with shelves of large glass) ars, in which floated all manner of revolting things Harry didn't really want to know the name of at the moment. The fireplace was dark and empty. Snape closed the door and turned to look at them.\n\u3000\u3000\"So,\" he said softly, \"the train isn't good enough for the famous Harry Potter and his faithful sidekick Weasley. Wanted to arrive with a bang, did we, boys?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No, sir, it was the barrier at King's Cross, it -\"\n\u3000\u300078\n\u3000\u3000\"Silence!\" said Snape coldly. \"What have you done with the car?\" Ron gulped. This wasn't the first time Snape had given Harry the impression of being able to read minds. But a moment later, he un derstood, as Snape unrolled today's issue of the Evening Prophet. \"You were seen,\" he hissed, showing them the headline: FLY ING FORD ANGLIA MYSTIFIES MUGGLES. He began to read aloud: \"Two Muggles in London, convinced they saw an old car flying over the Post Office tower ... at noon in Norfolk, Mrs. Hetty Bayliss, while hanging out her washing ... Mr. Angus Fleet, of Peebles, reported to police ... Six or seven Muggles in all. I be lieve your father works in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office?\" he said, looking up at Ron and smiling still more nastily. \"Dear, dear ... his own son. . . \" Harry felt as though he'd just been walloped in the stomach by one of the mad tree's larger branches. If anyone found out Mr. Weasley had bewitched the car ... he hadn't thought of that .... \"I noticed, in my search of the park, that considerable damage seems to have been done to a very valuable Whomping Willow,\" Snape went on. \"That tree did more damage to us than we -\" Ron blurted out. \"Silence!\" snapped Snape again. \"Most unfortunately, you are not in my House and the decision to expel you does not rest with me. I shall go and fetch the people who do have that happy power. You will wait here.\" Harry and Ron stared at each other, white-faced. Harry didn't feel hungry any more. He now felt extremely sick. He tried not to look at a large, slimy something suspended in green liquid on a\n\u3000\u3000shelf behind Snape's desk. If Snape had gone to fetch Professor McGonagall, head of Gryffindor House, they were hardly any better off. She might be fairer than Snape, but she was still extremely strict.\n\u3000\u3000Ten minutes later, Snape returned, and sure enough it was Professor McGonagall who accompanied him. Harry had seen Professor McGonagall angry on several occasions, but either he had forgotten just how thin her mouth could go, or he had never seen her this angry before. She raised her wand the moment she entered; Harry and Ron both flinched, but she merely pointed it at the empty fireplace, where flames suddenly erupted.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sit,\" she said, and they both backed into chairs by the fire.\n\u3000\u3000\"Explain,\" she said, her glasses glinting ominously.\n\u3000\u3000Ron launched into the story, starting with the barrier at the station refusing to let them through.\n\u3000\u3000\"\n\u3000\u3000-so we had no choice, Professor, we couldn't get on the train.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Why didn't you send us a letter by owl? I believe you have an owl?\" Professor McGonagall said coldly to Harry.\n\u3000\u3000Harry gaped at her. Now she said it, that seemed the obvious thing to have done.\n\u3000\u3000\"I - I didn't think -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That,\" said Professor McGonagall, \"is obvious.\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a knock on the office door and Snape, now looking happier than ever, opened it. There stood the headmaster, Professor Dumbledore.\n\u3000\u3000Harry's whole body went numb. Dumbledore was looking unusually grave. He stared down his very crooked nose at them, and\n\u3000\u3000*80*\n\u3000\u3000Harry suddenly found himself wishing he and Ron were still being beaten up by the Whomping Willow.\n\u3000\u3000There was a long silence. Then Dumbledore said, \"Please explain why you did this.\"\n\u3000\u3000It would have been better if he had shouted. Harry hated the disappointment in his voice. For some reason, he was unable to look Dumbledore in the eyes, and spoke instead to his knees. He told Dumbledore everything except that Mr. Weasley owned the bewitched car, making it sound as though he and Ron had happened to find a flying car parked outside the station. He knew Dumbledore would see through this at once, but Dumbledore asked no questions about the car. When Harry had finished, he merely continued to peer at them through his spectacles.\n\u3000\u3000\"We'll go and get our stuff,\" said Ron in a hopeless sort of voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"What are you talking about, Weasley?\" barked Professor McGonagall.\n\u3000\u3000 \"Well, you're expelling us, aren't you?\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked quickly at Dumbledore.\n\u3000\u3000\"Not today, Mr. Weasley,\" said Dumbledore. \"But I must impress upon both of you the seriousness of what you have done. I will be writing to both your families tonight. I must also warn you that if you do anything like this again, I will have no choice but to expel you.\"\n\u3000\u3000Snape looked as though Christmas had been canceled. He cleared his throat and said, \"Professor Dumbledore, these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry, caused serious damage to an old and valuable tree - surely acts of this nature -\"\n\u3000\u3000* 8i\n\u3000\u3000\"It will be for Professor McGonagall to decide on these boys' punishments, Severus,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"They are in her House and are therefore her responsibility.\" He turned to Professor McGonagall. \"I must go back to the feast, Minerva, I've got to give out a few notices. Come, Severus, there's a delicious-looking cus tard tart I want to sample -\" Snape shot a look of pure venom at Harry and Ron as he allowed himself to be swept out of his office, leaving them alone with Pro fessor McGonagall, who was still eyeing them like a wrathful eagle. \"You'd better get along to the hospital wing, Weasley, you're bleeding.\" \"Not much,\" said Ron, hastily wiping the cut over his eye with his sleeve. \"Professor, I wanted to watch my sister being Sorted -\" \"The Sorting Ceremony is over,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Your sister is also in Gryffindor.\" \"Oh, good,\" said Ron. \"And speaking of Gryffindor -\" Professor McGonagall said sharply, but Harry cut in: \"Professor, when we took the car, term hadn't started, so - so Gryffindor shouldn't really have points taken from it - should it?\" he finished, watching her anxiously. Professor McGonagall gave him a piercing look, but he was sure she had almost smiled. Her mouth looked less thin, anyway. \"I will not take any points from Gryffindor,\" she said, and Harry's heart lightened considerably. \"But you will both get a de tention.\" It was better than Harry had expected. As for Dumbledore's writing to the Dursleys, that was nothing. Harry knew perfectly well they'd just be disappointed that the Whomping Willow hadn't squashed him flat.\n\u3000\u300082\n\u3000\u3000Professor McGonagall raised her wand again and pointed it at Snape's desk. A large plate of sandwiches, two silver goblets, and a jug of-iced pumpkin juice appeared with a pop.\n\u3000\u3000\"You will eat in here and then go straight up to your dormitory,\" she said. \"I must also return to the feast.\"\n\u3000\u3000When the door had closed behind her, Ron let out a long, low whistle.\n\u3000\u3000\"I thought we'd had it,\" he said, grabbing a sandwich.\n\u3000\u3000\"So did I,\" said Harry, taking one, too.\n\u3000\u3000\"Can you believe our luck, though?\" said Ron thickly through a mouthful of chicken and ham. \"Fred and George must've flown that car five or six times and no Muggle ever saw them.\" He swallowed and took another huge bite. \"Why couldn't we get through the barrier?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry shrugged. \"We'll have to watch our step from now on, though,\" he said, taking a grateful swig of pumpkin juice. \"Wish we could've gone up to the feast ......\n\u3000\u3000\"She didn't want us showing off,\" said Ron sagely. \"Doesn't want people to think it's clever, arriving by flying car.\"\n\u3000\u3000When they had eaten as many sandwiches as they could (the plate kept refilling itself) they rose and left the office, treading the familiar path to Gryffindor Tower. The castle was quiet; it seemed that the feast was over. They walked past muttering portraits and creaking suits of armor, and climbed narrow flights of stone stairs, until at last they reached the passage where the secret entrance to Gryffindor Tower was hidden, behind an oil painting of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress.\n\u3000\u3000\"Password?\" she said as they approached.\n\u3000\u3000\"Er -\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000They didn't know the new year's password, not having met a Gryffindor prefect yet, but help came almost immediately; they heard hurrying feet behind them and turned to see Hermione dashing toward them.\n\u3000\u3000\"There you are! Where have you been? The most ridiculous rumors - someone said you'd been expelled for crashing a flying car\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, we haven't been expelled,\" Harry assured her.\n\u3000\u3000\"You're not telling me you did fly here?\" said Hermione, sounding almost as severe as Professor McGonagall.\n\u3000\u3000\"Skip the lecture,\" said Ron impatiently, \"and tell us the new password.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It's `wattlebird,\"' said Hermione impatiently, \"but that's not the point - \"\n\u3000\u3000Her words were cut short, however, as the portrait of the fat lady swung open and there was a sudden storm of clapping. It looked as though the whole of Gryffindor House was still awake, packed into the circular common room, standing on the lopsided tables and squashy armchairs, waiting for them to arrive. Arms reached through the portrait hole to pull Harry and Ron inside, leaving Hermione to scramble in after then-t.\n\u3000\u3000\"Brilliant!\" yelled Lee Jordan. \"Inspired! What an entrance! Flying a car right into the Whomping Willow, people'll be talking about that one for years -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Good for you,\" said a fifth year Harry had never spoken to; someone was patting him on the back as though he'd just won a marathon; Fred and George pushed their way to the front of the crowd and said together, \"Why couldn't we've come in the car, eh?\"\n\u3000\u300084\n\u3000\u3000Ron was scarlet in the face, grinning embarrassedly, but Harry could see one person who didn't look happy at all. Percy was visible over the heads of some excited first years, and he seemed to be trying to get near enough to start telling them off. Harry nudged Ron in the ribs and nodded in Percy's direction. Ron got the point at once.\n\u3000\u3000\"Got to get upstairs - bit tired,\" he said, and the two of them started pushing their way toward the door on the other side of the room, which led to a spiral staircase and the dormitories.\n\u3000\u3000\"'Night,\" Harry called back to Hermione, who was wearing a scowl just like Percy's.\n\u3000\u3000They managed to get to the other side of the common room, still having their backs slapped, and gained the peace of the staircase. They hurried up it, right to the top, and at last reached the door of their old dormitory, which now had a sign on it saying SECOND YEARS. They entered the familiar, circular room, with its five four-posters hung with red velvet and its high, narrow windows. Their trunks had been brought up for them and stood at the ends of their beds.\n\u3000\u3000Ron grinned guiltily at Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"I know I shouldn't've enjoyed that or anything, but ='\n\u3000\u3000The dormitory door flew open and in came the other second year Gryffindor boys, Seamus Finnigan, Dean Thomas, and Neville Longbottom.\n\u3000\u3000\"Unbelievable!\" beamed Seamus.\n\u3000\u3000\"Cool,\" said Dean.\n\u3000\u3000\"Amazing,\" said Neville, awestruck.\n\u3000\u3000Harry couldn't help it. He grinned, too.\n\u3000\u3000* 85 *\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER Six\n\u3000\u3000GILDEROY LOCKHART\n\u3000\u3000he next day, however, Harry barely grinned once. Things started to go downhill from breakfast in the Great Hall. The four long house tables were laden with tureens of porridge, plates of kippers, mountains of toast, and dishes of eggs and bacon, beneath the enchanted ceiling (today, a dull, cloudy gray). Harry and Ron sat down at the Gryffindor table next to Hermione, who had her copy of Voyages with Vampires propped open against a milk jug. There was a slight stiffness in the way she said \"Morning,\" which told Harry that she was still disapproving of the way they had arrived. Neville Longbottom, on the other hand, greeted them cheerfully. Neville was a round-faced and accident-prone boy with the worst memory of anyone Harry had ever met.\n\u3000\u3000\"Mail's due any minute - I think Gran's sending a few things I forgot.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry had only just started his porridge when, sure enough, there was a rushing sound overhead and a hundred or so owls\n\u3000\u300086\n\u3000\u3000streamed in, circling the hall and dropping letters and packages into the chattering crowd. A big, lumpy package bounced off Neville's head and, a second later, something large and gray fell into Hermione's jug, spraying them all with milk and feathers.\n\u3000\u3000\"Enrol!\" said Ron, pulling the bedraggled owl out by the feet. Errol slumped, unconscious, onto the table, his legs in the air and a damp red envelope in his beak.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, no -\" Ron gasped.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's all right, he's still alive,\" said Hermione, prodding Errol gently with the tip of her finger.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's not that - it's that.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron was pointing at the red envelope. It looked quite ordinary to Harry, but Ron and Neville were both looking at it as though they expected it to explode.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's the matter?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"She's - she's sent me a Howler,\" said Ron faintly.\n\u3000\u3000\"You'd better open it, Ron,\" said Neville in a timid whisper. \"It'll be worse if you don't My gran sent me one once, and I ignored it and\" - he gulped - \"it was horrible.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked from their petrified faces to the red envelope.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's a Howler?\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000But Ron's whole attention was fixed on the letter, which had begun to smoke at the corners.\n\u3000\u3000\"Open it,\" Neville urged. \"It'll all be over in a few minutes -\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron stretched out a shaking hand, eased the envelope from Errol's beak, and slit it open. Neville stuffed his fingers in his ears. A split second later, Harry knew why. He thought for a moment it had exploded; a roar of sound fiIled the huge hall, shaking dust from the ceiling.\n\u3000\u3000\"STEALING THE CAR, I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SURPRISED IF THEY'D EXPELLED YOU, YOU WAIT TILL I GET HOLD OF YOU, I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU STOPPED TO THINK WHAT YOUR FATHERAND I WENT THROUGH WHEN WE SAW IT WAS GONE -\"\n\u3000\u3000Mrs. Weasleys yells, a hundred times louder than usual, made the plates and spoons rattle on the table, and echoed deafeningly off the stone walls. People throughout the hall were swiveling around to see who had received the Howler, and Ron sank so low in his chair that only his crimson forehead could be seen.\n\u3000\u3000\"- LETTER FROM DUMBLEDORE LAST NIGHT, I THOUGHT YOUR FATHER WOULD DIE OF SHAME, WE DIDN'T BRING YOU UP TO BEHAVE LIKE THIS, YOU AND HARRY COULD BOTH HAVE DIED -\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry had been wondering when his name was going to crop up. He tried very hard to look as though he couldn't hear the voice that was making his eardrums throb.\n\u3000\u3000\"-ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED - YOUR FATHER'S FACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK, IT'S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT AND IF YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE WE'LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT BACK HOME.\"\n\u3000\u3000A ringing silence fell. The red envelope, which had dropped from Ron's hand, burst into flames and curled into ashes. Harry and Ron sat stunned, as though a tidal wave had just passed over them. A few people laughed and, gradually, a babble of talk broke out again.\n\u3000\u3000Hermione closed Voyages with Vampires and looked down at the top of Ron's head.\n\u3000\u3000* 88\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, I don't know what you expected, Ron, but you -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't tell me I deserved it,\" snapped Ron.\n\u3000\u3000Harry pushed his porridge away. His insides were burning with guilt. Mr. Weasley was facing an inquiry at work. After all Mr. and Mrs. Weasley had done for him over the summer ...\n\u3000\u3000But he had no time to dwell on this; Professor McGonagall was moving along the Gryffindor table, handing out course schedules. Harry took his and saw that they had double Herbology with the Hufepuffs first.\n\u3000\u3000Harry, Ron, and Hermione left the castle together, crossed the vegetable patch, and made for the greenhouses, where the magical plants were kept. At least the Howler had done one good thing: Hermione seemed to think they had now been punished enough and was being perfectly friendly again.\n\u3000\u3000As they neared the greenhouses they saw the rest of the class standing outside, waiting for Professor Sprout. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had only just joined them when she came striding into view across the lawn, accompanied by Gilderoy Lockhart. Professor Sprout's arms were full of bandages, and with another twinge of guilt, Harry spotted the Whomping Willow in the distance, several of its branches now in slings.\n\u3000\u3000Professor Sprout was a squat little witch who wore a patched hat over her flyaway hair; there was usually a large amount of earth on her clothes and her fingernails would have made Aunt Petunia faint. Gilderoy Lockhart, however, was immaculate in sweeping robes of turquoise, his golden hair shining under a perfectly positioned turquoise hat with gold trimming.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, hello there!\" he called, beaming around at the assembled\n\u3000\u300089\n\u3000\u3000students. \"Just been showing Professor Sprout the right way to doctor a Whomping Willow! But I don't want you running away with the idea that I'm better at Herbology than she is! I just happen to have met several of these exotic plants on my travels . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Greenhouse three today, chaps!\" said Professor Sprout, who was looking distinctly disgruntled, not at all her usual cheerful self.\n\u3000\u3000There was a murmur of interest. They had only ever worked in greenhouse one before - greenhouse three housed far more interesting and dangerous plants. Professor Sprout took a large key from her belt and unlocked the door. Harry caught a whiff of damp earth and fertilizer mingling with the heavy perfume of some giant, umbrella- sized flowers dangling from the ceiling. He was about to follow Ron and Hermione inside when Lockhart's hand shot out.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry! I've been wanting a word - you don't mind if he's a couple of minutes late, do you, Professor Sprout?\"\n\u3000\u3000Judging by Professor Sprout's scowl, she did mind, but Lockhart said, \"That's the ticket,\" and closed the greenhouse door in her face.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry,\" said Lockhart, his large white teeth gleaming in the sunlight as he shook his head. \"Harry, Harry, Harry.\"\n\u3000\u3000Completely nonplussed, Harry said nothing.\n\u3000\u3000\"When I heard -well, of course, it was all my fault. Could have kicked myself.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry had no idea what he was talking about. He was about to say so when Lockhart went on, \"Don't know when I've been more shocked. Flying a car to Hogwarts! Well, of course, I knew at once why you'd done it. Stood out a mile. Harry, Harry, Harry.\"\n\u3000\u3000It was remarkable how he could show every one of those brilliant teeth even when he wasn't talking.\n\u3000\u300090\n\u3000\u3000\"Gave you a taste for publicity, didn't I?\" said Lockhart. \"Gave you the bug. You got onto the front page of the paper with me and you couldn't wait to do it again.\" \"Oh, no, Professor, see -\" \"Harry, Harry, Harry,\" said Lockhart, reaching out and grasping his shoulder. \"I understand. Natural to want a bit more once you've had that first taste - and I blame myself for giving you that, be cause it was bound to go to your head - but see here, young man, you can't start flying cars to try and get yourself noticed. Just calm down, all right? Plenty of time for all that when you're older. Yes, yes, I know what you're thinking! 'It's all right for him, he's an in ternationally famous wizard already!' But when I was twelve, I was just as much of a nobody as you are now. In fact, Id say I was even more of a nobody! I mean, a few people have heard of you, haven't they? All that business with He-\\\"o-Must-Not-Be-Named!\" He glanced at the lightning scar on Harry's forehead. \"I know, I know - it's not quite as good as winning Witch Weekly's Most Charming-Smile Award five times in a row, as I have - but it's a start, Harry, it's a start.\" He gave Harry a hearty wink and strode off. Harry stood stunned for a few seconds, then, remembering he was supposed to be in the greenhouse, he opened the door and slid inside. Professor Sprout was standing behind a trestle bench in the cen ter of the greenhouse. About twenty pairs of different-colored ear muffs were lying on the bench. When Harry had taken his place between Ron and Hermione, she said, \"We'll be repotting Man drakes today. Now, who can tell me the properties of the Man drake?\" To nobody's surprise, Hermione's hand was first into the air.\n\u3000\u3000s1\n\u3000\u3000\"Mandrake, or Mandragora, is a powerful restorative,\" said Hermione, sounding as usual as though she had swallowed the textbook. \"It is used to return people who have been transfigured or cursed to their original state.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor,\" said Professor Sprout. \"The Mandrake forms an essential part of most antidotes. It is also, however, dangerous. Who can tell me why?\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione's hand narrowly missed Harry's glasses as it shot up again.\n\u3000\u3000\"The cry of the Mandrake is fatal to anyone who hears it,\" she said promptly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Precisely. Take another ten points,\" said Professor Sprout. \"Now, the Mandrakes we have here are still very young.\"\n\u3000\u3000She pointed to a row of deep trays as she spoke, and everyone shuffled forward for a better look. A hundred or so tufty little plants, purplish green in color, were growing there in rows. They looked quite unremarkable to Harry, who didn't have the slightest idea what Hermione meant by the \"cry\" of the Mandrake.\n\u3000\u3000\"Everyone take a pair of earmuffs,\" said Professor Sprout.\n\u3000\u3000There was a scramble as everyone tried to seize a pair that wasn't pink and fluffy.\n\u3000\u3000\"When I tell you to put them on, make sure your ears are completely covered,\" said Professor Sprout. \"When it is safe to remove them, I will give you the thumbs-up. Right - earmuffs on.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry snapped the earmuffs over his ears. They shut out sound completely. Professor Sprout put the pink, fluffy pair over her own ears, rolled up the sleeves of her robes, grasped one of the tufty plants firmly, and pulled hard.\n\u3000\u3000*92*\n\u3000\u3000Harry let out a gasp of surprise that no one could hear.\n\u3000\u3000Instead of roots, a small, muddy, and extremely ugly baby popped out of the earth. The leaves were growing right out of his head. He had pale green, mottled skin, and was clearly bawling at the top of his lungs.\n\u3000\u3000Professor Sprout took a large plant pot from under the table and plunged the Mandrake into it, burying him in dark, damp compost until only the tufted leaves were visible. Professor Sprout dusted off her hands, gave them all the thumbs-up, and removed her own earmuffs.\n\u3000\u3000\"As our Mandrakes are only seedlings, their cries won't kill yet,\" she said calmly as though she'd just done nothing more exciting than water a begonia. \"However, they will knock you out for several hours, and as I'm sure none of you want to miss your first day back, make sure your earmuffs are securely in place while you work. I will attract your attention when it is time to pack up.\n\u3000\u3000\"Four to a tray - there is a large supply of pots here - compost in the sacks over there - and be careful of the Venemous Tentacula, it's teething.\"\n\u3000\u3000She gave a sharp slap to a spiky, dark red plant as she spoke, making it draw in the long feelers that had been inching sneakily over her shoulder.\n\u3000\u3000Harry, Ron, and Hermione were joined at their tray by a curly-haired Hufflepuff boy Harry knew by sight but had never spoken to.\n\u3000\u3000\"Justin Finch-Fletchley,\" he said brightly, shaking Harry by the hand. \"Know who you are, of course, the famous Harry Potter... And you're Hermione Granger - always top in everything\"\n\u3000\u3000* 9%\n\u3000\u3000(Hermione beamed as she had her hand shaken too) \"- and Ron Weasley. Wasn't that your flying car?\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron didn't smile. The Howler was obviously still on his mind.\n\u3000\u3000\"That Lockhart's something, isn't he?\" said Justin happily as they began fiIling their plant pots with dragon dung compost. \"Awfully brave chap. Have you read his books? Id have died of fear if Id been cornered in a telephone booth by a werewolf, but he stayed cool and - zap - just fantastic.\n\u3000\u3000\"My name was down for Eton, you know. I can't tell you how glad I am I came here instead. Of course, Mother was slightly disappointed, but since I made her read Lockhart's books I think she's begun to see how useful it'll be to have a fully trained wizard in the family . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000After that they didn't have much chance to talk. Their earmuffs were back on and they needed to concentrate on the Mandrakes. Professor Sprout had made it look extremely easy, but it wasn't. The Mandrakes didn't like coming out of the earth, but didn't seem to want to go back into it either. They squirmed, kicked, flailed their sharp little fists, and gnashed their teeth; Harry spent ten whole minutes trying to squash a particularly fat one into a pot.\n\u3000\u3000By the end of the class, Harry, like everyone else, was sweaty, aching, and covered in earth. Everyone traipsed back to the castle for a quick wash and then the Gryffindors hurried off to Transfiguration.\n\u3000\u3000Professor McGonagall's classes were always hard work, but today was especially difficult. Everything Harry had learned last year seemed to have leaked out of his head during the summer. He was supposed to be turning a beetle into a button, but all he managed\n\u3000\u3000* 94\n\u3000\u3000to do was give his beetle a lot of exercise as it scuttled over the desktop avoiding his wand.\n\u3000\u3000Ron was having far worse problems. He had patched up his wand with some borrowed Spellotape, but it seemed to be damaged beyond repair. It kept crackling and sparking at odd moments, and every time Ron tried to transfigure his beetle it engulfed him in thick gray smoke that smelled of rotten eggs. Unable to see what he was doing, Ron accidentally squashed his beetle with his elbow and had to ask for a new one. Professor McGonagall wasn't pleased.\n\u3000\u3000Harry was relieved to hear the lunch bell. His brain felt like a wrung sponge. Everyone fiIed out of the classroom except him and Ron, who was whacking his wand furiously on the desk.\n\u3000\u3000\"Stupid - useless - thing -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Write home for another one,\" Harry suggested as the wand let off a volley of bangs like a firecracker.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, yeah, and get another Howler back,\" said Ron, stuffing the now hissing wand into his bag. \" `It's your own fault your wand got snapped - '\"\n\u3000\u3000They went down to lunch, where Ron's mood was not improved by Hermione's showing them the handful of perfect coat buttons she had produced in Transfiguration.\n\u3000\u3000\"What've we got this afternoon?\" said Harry, hastily changing the subject.\n\u3000\u3000\"Defense Against the Dark Arts,\" said Hermione at once.\n\u3000\u3000\"Why, \"demanded Ron, seizing her schedule, \"have you outlined all Lockhart's lessons in little hearts?\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione snatched the schedule back, blushing furiously.\n\u3000\u3000* 95 *\n\u3000\u3000They finished lunch and went outside into the overcast courtyard. Hermione sat down on a stone step and buried her nose in Voyages with Vampires again. Harry and Ron stood talking about Quidditch for several minutes before Harry became aware that he was being closely watched. Looking up, he saw the very small, mousy-haired boy he'd seen trying on the Sorting Hat last night staring at Harry as though transfixed. He was clutching what looked like an ordinary Muggle camera, and the moment Harry looked at him, he went bright red.\n\u3000\u3000\"All right, Harry? I'm -I'm Colin Creevey,\" he said breathlessly, taking a tentative step forward. \"I'm in Gryffindor, too. D'you think - would it be all right if - can I have a picture?\" he said, raising the camera hopefully.\n\u3000\u3000\"A picture?\" Harry repeated blankly.\n\u3000\u3000\"So I can prove I've met you,\" said Colin Creevey eagerly, edging further forward. \"I know all about you. Everyone's told me. About how you survived when You-Know-Who tried to kill you and how he disappeared and everything and how you've still got a lightning scar on your forehead\" (his eyes raked Harry's hairline) \"and a boy in my dormitory said if I develop the film in the right potion, the pictures'll move.\" Colin drew a great shuddering breath of excitement and said, \"It's amazing here, isn't it? I never knew all the odd stuff I could do was magic till I got the letter from Hogwarts. My dad's a milkman, he couldn't believe it either. So I'm taking loads of pictures to send home to him. And it'd be really good if I had one of you\" - he looked imploringly at Harry - \"maybe your friend could take it and I could stand next to you? And then, could you sign it?\"\n\u3000\u300096\n\u3000\u3000\"Signed photos? You're giving out signed photos, Potter?\"\n\u3000\u3000Loud and scathing, Draco Malfoy's voice echoed around the courtyard. He had stopped right behind Colin, flanked, as he always was at Hogwarts, by his large and thuggish cronies, Crabbe and Goyle.\n\u3000\u3000\"Everyone line up!\" Malfoy roared to the crowd. \"Harry Potter's giving out signed photos!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No, I'm not,\" said Harry angrily, his fists clenching. \"Shut up, Malfoy.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You're just jealous,\" piped up Colin, whose entire body was about as thick as Crabbe's neck.\n\u3000\u3000`jealous?\"said Malfoy, who didn't need to shout anymore: half the courtyard was listening in. \"Of what? I don't want a foul scar right across my head, thanks. I don't think getting your head cut open makes you that special, myself.\"\n\u3000\u3000Crabbe and Goyle were sniggering stupidly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Eat slugs, Malfoy,\" said Ron angrily. Crabbe stopped laughing and started rubbing his knuckles in a menacing way.\n\u3000\u3000\"Be careful, Weasley,\" sneered Malfoy. \"You don't want to start any trouble or your Mommy'll have to come and take you away from school.\" He put on a shrill, piercing voice. \"Ifyou put another toe out of line' - \"\n\u3000\u3000A knot of Slytherin fifth-years nearby laughed loudly at this.\n\u3000\u3000\"Weasley would like a signed photo, Potter,\" smirked Malfoy. \"It'd be worth more than his family's whole house -\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron whipped out his Spellotaped wand, but Hermione shut Voyages with Vampires with a snap and whispered, \"Look out!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What's all this, what's all this?\" Gilderoy Lockhart was striding\n\u3000\u3000* 97\n\u3000\u3000toward them, his turquoise robes swirling behind him. \"Who's giv ing out signed photos?\" Harry started to speak but he was cut short as Lockhart flung an arm around his shoulders and thundered jovially, \"Shouldn't have asked! We meet again, Harry!\" Pinned to Lockhart's side and burning with humiliation, Harry saw Malfoy slide smirking back into the crowd. \"Come on then, Mr. Creevey,\" said Lockhart, beaming at Colin. \"A double portrait, can't do better than that, and we'll both sign it for you.\" Colin fumbled for his camera and took the picture as the bell rang behind them, signaling the start of afternoon classes. \"Off you go, move along there,\" Lockhart called to the crowd, and he set off back to the castle with Harry, who was wishing he knew a good Vanishing Spell, still clasped to his side. \"A word to the wise, Harry,\" said Lockhart paternally as they entered the building through a side door. \"I covered up for you back there with young Creevey - if he was photographing me, too, your schoolmates won't think you're setting yourself up so much . . . .\" Deaf to Harry's stammers, Lockhart swept him down a corridor lined with staring students and up a staircase. \"Let me just say that handing out signed pictures at this stage of your career isn't sensible - looks a tad bigheaded, Harry, to be frank. There may well come a time when, like me, you'll need to keep a stack handy wherever you go, but\" - he gave a little chor tle - \"I don't think you're quite there yet.\" They had reached Lockhart's classroom and he let Harry go at\n\u3000\u300098\n\u3000\u3000last. Harry yanked his robes straight and headed for a seat at the very back of the class, where he busied himself with piling all seven of Lockhart's books in front of him, so that he could avoid looking at the real thing.\n\u3000\u3000The rest of the class came clattering in, and Ron and Hermione sat down on either side of Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"You could've fried an egg on your face\" said Ron. \"You'd better hope Creevey doesn't meet Ginny, or they'll be starting a Harry Potter fan club.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Shut up,\" snapped Harry. The last thing he needed was for Lockhart to hear the phrase \"Harry Potter fan club.\"\n\u3000\u3000When the whole class was seated, Lockhart cleared his throat loudly and silence fell. He reached forward, picked up Neville Longbottom's copy of Travels with Trolls, and held it up to show his own, winking portrait on the front.\n\u3000\u3000\"Me,\" he said, pointing at it and winking as well. \"Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League, and five-time winner of Witch Weekly's Most- Charming-Smile Award - but I don't talk about that. I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at her!\"\n\u3000\u3000He waited for them to laugh; a few people smiled weakly.\n\u3000\u3000\"I see you've all bought a complete set of my books -well done. I thought we'd start today with a little quiz. Nothing to worry about\n\u3000\u3000just to check how well you've read them, how much you've taken in -\"\n\u3000\u3000When he had handed out the test papers he returned to the front of the class and said, \"You have thirty minutes - start - now!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked down at his paper and read:\n\u3000\u30001.\tWhat is Gilderoy Lockhart 's favorite color?\n\u3000\u30002.\tWhat is Gilderoy Lockhart's secret ambition?\n\u3000\u30003.\tWhat, in your opinion, is Gilderoy Lockhart's greatest achievement to date?\n\u3000\u3000On and on it went, over three sides of paper, right down to:\n\u3000\u30004.\tWhen is Gilderoy Lockhart's birthday, and what would his ideal gift be?\n\u3000\u3000Half an hour later, Lockhart collected the papers and rifled through them in front of the class.\n\u3000\u3000\"Tut, tut - hardly any of you remembered that my favorite color is lilac. I say so in Year with the Yeti. And a few of you need to read Wanderings with Werewolves more carefully - I clearly state in chapter twelve that my ideal birthday gift would be harmony between all magic and non-magic peoples - though I wouldn't say no to a large bottle of Ogdeds Old Firewhisky!\"\n\u3000\u3000He gave them another roguish wink. Ron was now staring at Lockhart with an expression of disbelief on his face; Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas, who were sitting in front, were shaking with silent laughter. Hermione, on the other hand, was listening to Lockhart with rapt attention and gave a start when he mentioned her name.\n\u3000\u3000\". . . but Miss Hermione Granger knew my secret ambition is to rid the world of evil and market my own range of hair-care potions - good girl! In fact\" - he flipped her paper over - \"full marks! Where is Miss Hermione Granger?\"\n\u3000\u3000*100*\n\u3000\u3000Hermione raised a trembling hand.\n\u3000\u3000\"Excellent!\" beamed Lockhart. \"Quite excellent! Take ten points for Gryffindor! And so - to business -\"\n\u3000\u3000He bent down behind his desk and lifted a large, covered cage onto it.\n\u3000\u3000\"Now - be warned! It is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind! You may find yourselves facing your worst fears in this room. Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here. All I ask is that you remain calm.\"\n\u3000\u3000In spite of himself, Harry leaned around his pile of books for a better look at the cage. Lockhart placed a hand on the cover. Dean and Seamus had stopped laughing now. Neville was cowering in his front row seat.\n\u3000\u3000\"I must ask you not to scream,\" said Lockhart in a low voice. \"It might provoke them.\"\n\u3000\u3000As the whole class held its breath, Lockhart whipped off the cover.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" he said dramatically. \"Freshly caught Cornish pixies. \"\n\u3000\u3000Seamus Finnigan couldn't control himself. He let out a snort of laughter that even Lockhart couldn't mistake for a scream of terror.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes?\" He smiled at Seamus.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, they're not - they're not very - dangerous, are they?\" Seamus choked.\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't be so sure!\" said Lockhart, waggling a finger annoyingly at Seamus. \"Devilish tricky little blighters they can be!\"\n\u3000\u3000The pixies were electric blue and about eight inches high, with pointed faces and voices so shrill it was like listening to a lot of budgies arguing. The moment the cover had been removed, they\n\u3000\u3000*101*\n\u3000\u3000had started jabbering and rocketing around, rattling the bars and making bizarre faces at the people nearest them.\n\u3000\u3000\"Right, then,\" Lockhart said loudly. \"Let's see what you make of them!\" And he opened the cage.\n\u3000\u3000It was pandemonium. The pixies shot in every direction like rockets. Two of them seized Neville by the ears and lifted him into the air. Several shot straight through the window, showering the back row with broken glass. The rest proceeded to wreck the classroom more effectively than a rampaging rhino. They grabbed ink bottles and sprayed the class with them, shredded books and papers, tore pictures from the walls, up-ended the waste basket, grabbed bags and books and threw them out of the smashed window; within minutes, half the class was sheltering under desks and Neville was swinging from the iron chandelier in the ceiling.\n\u3000\u3000\"Come on now - round them up, round them up, they're only pixies,\" Lockhart shouted.\n\u3000\u3000He rolled up his sleeves, brandished his wand, and bellowed,\n\u3000\u3000\"Peskipiksi Pesternomi!\"\n\u3000\u3000It had absolutely no effect; one of the pixies seized his wand and threw it out of the window, too. Lockhart gulped and dived under his own desk, narrowly avoiding being squashed by Neville, who fell a second later as the chandelier gave way.\n\u3000\u3000The bell rang and there was a mad rush toward the exit. In the relative calm that followed, Lockhart straightened up, caught sight of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, who were almost at the door, and said, \"Well, I'll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage.\" He swept past them and shut the door quickly behind him.\n\u3000\u3000*102*\n\u3000\u3000\"Can you believe him?\" roared Ron as one of the remaining pixies bit him painfully on the ear.\n\u3000\u3000\"He just wants to give us some hands-on experience,\" said Hermione, immobilizing two pixies at once with a clever Freezing Charm and stuffing them back into their cage.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hands on? \"said Harry, who was trying to grab a pixie dancing out of reach with its tongue out. \"Hermione, he didn't have a clue what he was doing -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Rubbish,\" said Hermione. \"You've read his books - look at all those amazing things he's done -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He says he's done,\" Ron muttered.\n\u3000\u3000arry spent a lot of time over the next few days dodging out of sight whenever he saw Gilderoy Lockhart coming down a corridor. Harder to avoid was Colin Creevey, who seemed to have memorized Harry's schedule. Nothing seemed to give Colin a bigger thrill than to say, \"All right, Harry?\" six or seven times a day and hear, \"Hello, Colin,\" back, however exasperated Harry sounded when he said it.\n\u3000\u3000Hedwig was still angry with Harry about the disasterous car journey and Ron's wand was still malfunctioning, surpassing itself on Friday morning by shooting out of Ron's hand in Charms and hitting tiny old Professor Flitwick squarely between the eyes, creating a large, throbbing green boil where it had struck. So with one thing and another, Harry was quite glad to reach the weekend. He, Ron, and Hermione were planning to visit Hagrid on Saturday morning. Harry, however, was shaken awake several hours earlier\n\u3000\u3000*104*\n\u3000\u3000than he would have liked by Oliver Wood, Captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team.\n\u3000\u3000\"Whassamatter?\" said Harry groggily.\n\u3000\u3000\"Quidditch practice!\" said Wood. \"Come on!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry squinted at the window. There was a thin mist hanging across the pink-and-gold sky. Now that he was awake, he couldn't understand how he could have slept through the racket the birds were making.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oliver,\" Harry croaked. \"It's the crack of dawn.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Exactly,\" said Wood. He was a tall and burly sixth year and, at the moment, his eyes were gleaming with a crazed enthusiasm. \"It's part of our new training program. Come on, grab your broom, and let's go,\" said Wood heartily. \"None of the other teams have started training yet; we're going to be first off the mark this year -\"\n\u3000\u3000Yawning and shivering slightly, Harry climbed out of bed and tried to find his Quidditch robes.\n\u3000\u3000\"Good man,\" said Wood. \"Meet you on the field in fifteen minutes.\n\u3000\u3000When he'd found his scarlet team robes and pulled on his cloak for warmth, Harry scribbled a note to Ron explaining where he'd gone and went down the spiral staircase to the common room, his Nimbus Two Thousand on his shoulder. He had just reached the portrait hole when there was a clatter behind him and Colin Creevey came dashing down the spiral staircase, his camera swinging madly around his neck and something clutched in his hand.\n\u3000\u3000\"I heard someone saying your name on the stairs, Harry! Look what I've got here! I've had it developed, I wanted to show you -\"\n\u3000\u3000*105*\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked bemusedly at the photograph Colin was brandishing under his nose.\n\u3000\u3000A moving, black-and-white Lockhart was tugging hard on an arm Harry recognized as his own. He was pleased to see that his photographic self was putting up a good fight and refusing to be dragged into view. As Harry watched, Lockhart gave up and slumped, panting, against the white edge of the picture.\n\u3000\u3000\"Will you sign it?\" said Colin eagerly.\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Harry flatly, glancing around to check that the room was really deserted. \"Sorry, Colin, I'm in a hurry - Quidditch practice -\"\n\u3000\u3000He climbed through the portrait hole.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, wow! Wait for me! I've never watched a Quidditch game before!\"\n\u3000\u3000Colin scrambled through the hole after him.\n\u3000\u3000\"It'll be really boring,\" Harry said quickly, but Colin ignored him, his face shining with excitement.\n\u3000\u3000\"You were the youngest House player in a hundred years, weren't you, Harry? Weren't you?\" said Colin, trotting alongside him. \"You must be brilliant. I've never flown. Is it easy? Is that your own broom? Is that the best one there is?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't know how to get rid of him. It was like having an extremely talkative shadow.\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't really understand Quidditch,\" said Colin breathlessly. \"Is it true there are four balls? And two of them fly around trying to knock people off their brooms?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" said Harry heavily, resigned to explaining the complicated rules of Quidditch. \"They're called Bludgers. There are two Beaters\n\u3000\u3000*106*\n\u3000\u3000on each team who carry clubs to beat the Bludgers away from their side. Fred and George Weasley are the Gryffindor Beaters.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"And what are the other balls for?\" Colin asked, tripping down a couple of steps because he was gazing open-mouthed at Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, the Quafe - that's the biggish red one - is the one that scores goals. Three Chasers on each team throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through the goal posts at the end of the pitch - they're three long poles with hoops on the end.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"And the fourth ball -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"- is the Golden Snitch,\" said Harry, \"and it's very small, very fast, and difficult to catch. But that's what the Seeker's got to do, because a game of Quidditch doesn't end until the Snitch has been caught. And whichever team's Seeker gets the Snitch earns his team an extra hundred and fifty points.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"And you're the Gryffindor Seeker, aren't you?\" said Colin in awe.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" said Harry as they left the castle and started across the dew- drenched grass. \"And there's the Keeper, too. He guards the goal posts. That's it, really.\"\n\u3000\u3000But Colin didn't stop questioning Harry all the way down the sloping lawns to the Quidditch field, and Harry only shook him off when he reached the changing rooms; Colin called after him in a piping voice, \"I'll go and get a good seat, Harry!\" and hurried off to the stands.\n\u3000\u3000The rest of the Gryffindor team were already in the changing room. Wood was the only person who looked truly awake. Fred and George Weasley were sitting, puffy-eyed and touslehaired, next to fourth year Alicia Spinnet, who seemed to be nodding off against the wall behind her. Her fellow Chasers, Katie\n\u3000\u3000*107*\n\u3000\u3000Bell and Angelina Johnson, were yawning side by side opposite them.\n\u3000\u3000\"There you are, Harry, what kept you?\" said Wood briskly. \"Now, I wanted a quick talk with you all before we actually get onto the field, because I spent the summer devising a whole new training program, which I really think will make all the difference ....\n\u3000\u3000Wood was holding up a large diagram of a Quidditch field, on which were drawn many lines, arrows, and crosses in differentcolored inks. He took out his wand, tapped the board, and the arrows began to wiggle over the diagram like caterpillars. As Wood launched into a speech about his new tactics, Fred Weasley's head drooped right onto Alicia Spinnet's shoulder and he began to snore.\n\u3000\u3000The first board took nearly twenty minutes to explain, but there was another board under that, and a third under that one. Harry sank into a stupor as Wood droned on and on.\n\u3000\u3000\"So,\" said Wood, at long last, jerking Harry from a wistful fantasy about what he could be eating for breakfast at this very moment up at the castle. \"Is that clear? Any questions?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I've got a question, Oliver,\" said George, who had woken with a start. \"Why couldn't you have told us all this yesterday when we were awake?\"\n\u3000\u3000Wood wasn't pleased.\n\u3000\u3000\"Now, listen here, you lot,\" he said, glowering at them all. \"We should have won the Quidditch cup last year. We're easily the best team. But unfortunately -owing to circumstances beyond our control - \"\n\u3000\u3000*108*\n\u3000\u3000Harry shifted guiltily in his seat. He had been unconscious in the hospital wing for the final match of the previous year, meaning that Gryffindor had been a player short and had suffered their worst defeat in three hundred years.\n\u3000\u3000Wood took a moment to regain control of himself. Their last defeat was clearly still torturing him.\n\u3000\u3000\"So this year, we train harder than ever before .... Okay, let's go and put our new theories into practice!\" Wood shouted, seizing his broomstick and leading the way out of the locker rooms. Stifflegged and still yawning, his team followed.\n\u3000\u3000They had been in the locker room so long that the sun was up completely now, although remnants of mist hung over the grass in the stadium. As Harry walked onto the field, he saw Ron and Hermione sitting in the stands.\n\u3000\u3000\"Aren't you finished yet?\" called Ron incredulously.\n\u3000\u3000\"Haven't even started,\" said Harry, looking jealously at the toast and marmalade Ron and Hermione had brought out of the Great Hall. \"Wood's been teaching us new moves.\"\n\u3000\u3000He mounted his broomstick and kicked at the ground, soaring up into the air. The cool morning air whipped his face, waking him far more effectively than Wood's long talk. It felt wonderful to be back on the Quidditch field. He soared right around the stadium at full speed, racing Fred and George.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's that funny clicking noise?\" called Fred as they hurtled around the corner.\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked into the stands. Colin was sitting in one of the highest seats, his camera raised, taking picture after picture, the sound strangely magnified in the deserted stadium.\n\u3000\u3000*io9*\n\u3000\u3000\"Look this way, Harry! This way!\" he cried shrilly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Who's that?\" said Fred.\n\u3000\u3000\"No idea,\" Harry lied, putting on a spurt of speed that took him as far away as possible from Colin.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's going on?\" said Wood, frowning, as he skimmed through the air toward them. \"Why's that first year taking pictures? I don't like it. He could be a Slytherin spy, trying to find out about our new training program.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He's in Gryffindor,\" said Harry quickly.\n\u3000\u3000\"And the Slytherins don't need a spy, Oliver,\" said George.\n\u3000\u3000\"What makes you say that?\" said Wood testily.\n\u3000\u3000\"Because they're here in person,\" said George, pointing.\n\u3000\u3000Several people in green robes were walking onto the field, broomsticks in their hands.\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't believe it!\" Wood hissed in outrage. \"I booked the field for today! We'll see about this!\"\n\u3000\u3000Wood shot toward the ground, landing rather harder than he meant to in his anger, staggering slightly as he dismounted. Harry, Fred, and George followed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Flint!\" Wood bellowed at the Slytherin Captain. \"This is our practice time! We got up specially! You can clear off now!\"\n\u3000\u3000Marcus Flint was even larger than Wood. He had a look of trollish cunning on his face as he replied, \"Plenty of room for all of us, Wood.\"\n\u3000\u3000Angelina, Alicia, and Katie had come over, too. There were no girls on the Slytherin team, who stood shoulder to shoulder, facing the Gryffindors, leering to a man.\n\u3000\u3000\"But I booked the field!\" said Wood, positively spitting with rage. \"I booked it!\"\n\u3000\u3000*110*\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah,\" said Flint. \"But I've got a specially signed note here from Professor Snape. `I, Professor S. Snape, give the Slytherin team permission to practice today on the Quidditch field owing to the need to train their new Seeker.\"'\n\u3000\u3000\"You've got a new Seeker?\" said Wood, distracted. \"Where?\"\n\u3000\u3000And from behind the six large figures before them came a seventh, smaller boy, smirking all over his pale, pointed face. It was Draco Malfoy.\n\u3000\u3000\"Aren't you Lucius Malfoy's son?\" said Fred, looking at Malfoy with dislike.\n\u3000\u3000\"Funny you should mention Draco's father,\" said Flint as the whole Slytherin team smiled still more broadly. \"Let me show you the generous gift he's made to the Slytherin team.\"\n\u3000\u3000All seven of them held out their broomsticks. Seven highly polished, brand-new handles and seven sets of fine gold lettering spelling the words Nimbus Two Thousand and One gleamed under the Gryffindors' noses in the early morning sun.\n\u3000\u3000\"Very latest model. Only came out last month,\" said Flint carelessly, flicking a speck of dust from the end of his own. \"I believe it outstrips the old Two Thousand series by a considerable amount. As for the old Cleansweeps\" - he smiled nastily at Fred and George, who were both clutching Cleansweep Fives - \"sweeps the board with them.\"\n\u3000\u3000None of the Gryffindor team could think of anything to say for a moment. Malfoy was smirking so broadly his cold eyes were reduced to slits.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, look,\" said Flint. \"A field invasion.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron and Hermione were crossing the grass to see what was going on.\n\u3000\u3000*111*\n\u3000\u3000\"What's happening?\" Ron asked Harry. \"Why aren't you playing? And what's he doing here?\"\n\u3000\u3000He was looking at Malfoy, taking in his Slytherin Quidditch robes.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm the new Slytherin Seeker, Weasley,\" said Malfoy, smugly. \"Everyone's just been admiring the brooms my father's bought our team.\n\u3000\u3000Ron gaped, open-mouthed, at the seven superb broomsticks in front of him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Good, aren't they?\" said Malfoy smoothly. \"But perhaps the Gryffindor team will be able to raise some gold and get new brooms, too. You could raffle off those Cleansweep Fives; I expect a museum would bid for them.\"\n\u3000\u3000The Slytherin team howled with laughter.\n\u3000\u3000\"At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in,\" said Hermione sharply. \"They got in on pure talent.\"\n\u3000\u3000The smug look on Malfoy's face flickered.\n\u3000\u3000\"No one asked your opinion, you fiIthy little Mudblood,\" he spat.\n\u3000\u3000Harry knew at once that Malfoy had said something really bad because there was an instant uproar at his words. Flint had to dive in front of Malfoy to stop Fred and George jumping on him, Alicia shrieked, \"How dare you!\" ; and Ron plunged his hand into his robes, pulled out his wand, yelling, \"You'll pay for that one, Malfoy!\" and pointed it furiously under Flint's arm at Malfoys face.\n\u3000\u3000A loud bang echoed around the stadium and a jet of green light shot out of the wrong end of Ron's wand, hitting him in the stomach and sending him reeling backward onto the grass.\n\u3000\u300012\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron! Ron! Are you all right?\" squealed Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000Ron opened his mouth to speak, but no words came out. Instead he gave an almighty belch and several slugs dribbled out of his mouth onto his lap.\n\u3000\u3000The Slytherin team were paralyzed with laughter. Flint was doubled up, hanging onto his new broomstick for support. Malfoy was on all fours, banging the ground with his fist. The Gryffindors were gathered around Ron, who kept belching large, glistening slugs. Nobody seemed to want to touch him.\n\u3000\u3000\"We'd better get him to Hagrid's, it's nearest,\" said Harry to Hermione, who nodded bravely, and the pair of them pulled Ron up by the arms.\n\u3000\u3000\"What happened, Harry? What happened? Is he ill? But you can cure him, can't you?\" Colin had run down from his seat and was now dancing alongside them as they left the field. Ron gave a huge heave and more slugs dribbled down his front.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oooh,\" said Colin, fascinated and raising his camera. \"Can you hold him still, Harry?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Get out of the way, Colin!\" said Harry angrily. He and Hermione supported Ron out of the stadium and across the grounds toward the edge of the forest.\n\u3000\u3000\"Nearly there, Ron,\" said Hermione as the gamekeeper's cabin came into view. \"You'll be all right in a minute - almost there -\"\n\u3000\u3000They were within twenty feet of Hagrid's house when the front door opened, but it wasn't Hagrid who emerged. Gilderoy Lockhart, wearing robes of palest mauve today, came striding out.\n\u3000\u3000\"Quick, behind here,\" Harry hissed, dragging Ron behind a nearby bush. Hermione followed, somewhat reluctantly.\n\u3000\u3000*113* *\n\u3000\u3000\"It's a simple matter if you know what you're doing!\" Lockhart was saying loudly to Hagrid. \"If you need help, you know where I am! I'll let you have a copy of my book. I'm surprised you haven't already got one - I'll sign one tonight and send it over. Well, good-bye!\" And he strode away toward the castle.\n\u3000\u3000Harry waited until Lockhart was out of sight, then pulled Ron out of the bush and up to Hagrid's front door. They knocked urgently.\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid appeared at once, looking very grumpy, but his expression brightened when he saw who it was.\n\u3000\u3000\"Bin wonderin' when you'd come ter see me - come in, come in - thought you mighta bin Professor Lockhart back again -\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Hermione supported Ron over the threshold into the one- roomed cabin, which had an enormous bed in one corner, a fire crackling merrily in the other. Hagrid didn't seem perturbed by Ron's slug problem, which Harry hastily explained as he lowered Ron into a chair.\n\u3000\u3000\"Better out than in,\" he said cheerfully, plunking a large copper basin in front of him. \"Get 'em all up, Ron.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't think there's anything to do except wait for it to stop,\" said Hermione anxiously, watching Ron bend over the basin. \"That's a difficult curse to work at the best of times, but with a broken wand -\"\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid was bustling around making them tea. His boarhound, Fang, was slobbering over Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"What did Lockhart want with you, Hagrid?\" Harry asked, scratching Fang's ears.\n\u3000\u3000\"Givin' me advice on gettin' kelpies out of a well,\" growled\n\u3000\u3000*114*\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid, moving a half-plucked rooster off his scrubbed table and setting down the teapot. \"Like I don' know. An' bangin' on about some banshee he banished. If one word of it was true, I'll eat my kettle.\"\n\u3000\u3000It was most unlike Hagrid to criticize a Hogwarts' teacher, and Harry looked at him in surprise. Hermione, however, said in a voice somewhat higher than usual, \"I think you're being a bit unfair. Professor Dumbledore obviously thought he was the best man for the job -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He was the on' man for the job,\" said Hagrid, offering them a Y\n\u3000\u3000plate of treacle fudge, while Ron coughed squelchily into his basin. \"An' I mean the on' one. Gettin' very difficult ter find anyone fer Y\n\u3000\u3000the Dark Arts job. People aren't too keen ter take it on, see. They're startin' ter think it's jinxed. No one's lasted long fer a while now. So tell me,\" said Hagrid, jerking his head at Ron. \"Who was he tryin' ter curse?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Malfoy called Hermione something - it must've been really bad, because everyone went wild.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It was bad,\" said Ron hoarsely, emerging over the tabletop looking pale and sweaty. \"Malfoy called her `Mudblood,' Hagrid -\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron dived out of sight again as a fresh wave of slugs made their appearance. Hagrid looked outraged.\n\u3000\u3000\"He didn'!\" he growled at Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"He did,\" she said. \"But I don't know what it means. I could tell it was really rude, of course -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It's about the most insulting thing he could think of,\" gasped Ron, coming back up. \"Mudblood's a really foul name for someone who is Muggle-born - you know, non-magic parents. There are\n\u3000\u3000*115*\n\u3000\u3000some wizards - like Malfoy's family - who think they're better than everyone else because they're what people call pure-blood.\" He gave a small burp, and a single slug fell into his outstretched hand. He threw it into the basin and continued, \"I mean, the rest of us know it doesn't make any difference at all. Look at Neville Longbottom - he's pure-blood and he can hardly stand a cauldron the right way up.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"An' they haven't invented a spell our Hermione can' do,\" said Hagrid proudly, making Hermione go a brilliant shade of magenta.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's a disgusting thing to call someone,\" said Ron, wiping his sweaty brow with a shaking hand. \"Dirty blood, see. Common blood. It's ridiculous. Most wizards these days are half-blood anyway. If we hadn't married Muggles we'd've died out.\"\n\u3000\u3000He retched and ducked out of sight again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, I don' blame yeh fer tryin' ter curse him, Ron,\" said Hagrid loudly over the thuds of more slugs hitting the basin. \"Bu' maybe it was a good thing yer wand backfired. 'Spect Lucius Malfoy would've come marchin' up ter school if yeh'd cursed his son. Least yer not in trouble.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry would have pointed out that trouble didn't come much worse than having slugs pouring out of your mouth, but he couldn't; Hagrid's treacle fudge had cemented his jaws together.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry,\" said Hagrid abruptly as though struck by a sudden thought. \"Gotta bone ter pick with yeh. I've heard you've bin givin' out signed photos. How come I haven't got one?\"\n\u3000\u3000Furious, Harry wrenched his teeth apart.\n\u3000\u3000\"I have not been giving out signed photos,\" he said hotly. \"If Lockhart's still spreading that around -\"\n\u3000\u3000*116*\n\u3000\u3000But then he saw that Hagrid was laughing.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm on'y jokin',\" he said, patting Harry genially on the back and sending him face first into the table. \"I knew yeh hadn't really. I told Lockhart yeh didn' need teh. Yer more famous than him without tryin'.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Bet he didn't like that,\" said Harry, sitting up and rubbing his chin.\n\u3000\u3000\"Don' think he did,\" said Hagrid, his eyes twinkling. \"An' then I told him Id never read one o' his books an' he decided ter go. Treacle fudge, Ron?\" he added as Ron reappeared.\n\u3000\u3000\"No thanks,\" said Ron weakly. \"Better not risk it.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Come an' see what I've bin growin',\" said Hagrid as Harry and Hermione finished the last of their tea.\n\u3000\u3000In the small vegetable patch behind Hagrid's house were a dozen of the largest pumpkins Harry had ever seen. Each was the size of a large boulder.\n\u3000\u3000\"Gettin' on well, aren't they?\" said Hagrid happily. \"Fer the Halloween feast ... should be big enough by then.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What've you been feeding them?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid looked over his shoulder to check that they were alone.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, I've bin givin' them - you know - a bit o' help -\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry noticed Hagrid's flowery pink umbrella leaning against the back wall of the cabin. Harry had had reason to believe before now that this umbrella was not all it looked; in fact, he had the strong impression that Hagrid's old school wand was concealed inside it. Hagrid wasn't supposed to use magic. He had been expelled from Hogwarts in his third year, but Harry had never found out why -any mention of the matter and Hagrid would clear his\n\u3000\u3000*117*\n\u3000\u3000throat loudly and become mysteriously deaf until the subject was changed.\n\u3000\u3000\"An Engorgement Charm, I suppose?\" said Hermione, halfway between disapproval and amusement. \"Well, you've done a good job on them.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That's what yer little sister said,\" said Hagrid, nodding at Ron. \"Met her jus' yesterday.\" Hagrid looked sideways at Harry, his beard twitching. \"Said she was jus' lookin' round the grounds, but I reckon she was hopin' she might run inter someone else at my house.\" He winked at Harry. \"If yeh ask me, she wouldn' say no ter a signed -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, shut up,\" said Harry. Ron snorted with laughter and the ground was sprayed with slugs.\n\u3000\u3000\"Watch it!\" Hagrid roared, pulling Ron away from his precious pumpkins.\n\u3000\u3000It was nearly lunchtime and as Harry had only had one bit of treacle fudge since dawn, he was keen to go back to school to eat. They said good-bye to Hagrid and walked back up to the castle, Ron hiccoughing occasionally, but only bringing up two very small slugs.\n\u3000\u3000They had barely set foot in the cool entrance hall when a voice rang out, \"There you are, Potter - Weasley.\" Professor McGonagall was walking toward them, looking stern. \"You will both do your detentions this evening.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What're we doing, Professor?\" said Ron, nervously suppressing a burp.\n\u3000\u3000\"You will be polishing the silver in the trophy room with Mr. Filch,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"And no magic, Weasley - elbow grease.\"\n\u3000\u3000*118*\n\u3000\u3000Ron gulped. Argus Filch, the caretaker, was loathed by every student in the school.\n\u3000\u3000\"And you, Potter, will be helping Professor Lockhart answer his fan mail,\" said Professor McGonagall.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh n - Professor, can't I go and do the trophy room, too?\" said Harry desperately.\n\u3000\u3000\"Certainly not,\" said Professor McGonagall, raising her eyebrows. \"Professor Lockhart requested you particularly. Eight o'clock sharp, both of you.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron slouched into the Great Hall in states of deepest gloom, Hermione behind them, wearing a well-you-did-break-school- rules  sort of expression. Harry didn't enjoy his shepherd's pie as much as he'd thought. Both he and Ron felt they'd got the worse deal.\n\u3000\u3000\"Filch'll have me there all night,\" said Ron heavily. \"No magic! There must be about a hundred cups in that room. I'm no good at Muggle cleaning.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'd swap anytime,\" said Harry hollowly. \"I've had loads of practice with the Dursleys. Answering Lockhart's fan mail ... he'll be a nightmare ......\n\u3000\u3000Saturday afternoon seemed to melt away, and in what seemed like no time, it was five minutes to eight, and Harry was dragging his feet along the second-floor corridor to Lockhart's office. He gritted his teeth and knocked.\n\u3000\u3000The door flew open at once. Lockhart beamed down at him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah, here's the scalawag!\" he said. \"Come in, Harry, come in -\"\n\u3000\u3000Shining brightly on the walls by the light of many candles were countless framed photographs of Lockhart. He had even signed a few of them. Another large pile lay on his desk.\n\u3000\u3000\"You can address the envelopes!\" Lockhart told Harry, as though this was a huge treat. \"This first one's to Gladys Gudgeon, bless her - huge fan of mine -\"\n\u3000\u3000The minutes snailed by. Harry let Lockhart's voice wash over him, occasionally saying, \"Mmm\" and \"Right\" and \"Yeah.\" Now and then he caught a phrase like, \"Fame's a fickle friend, Harry,\" or \"Celebrity is as celebrity does, remember that.\"\n\u3000\u3000The candles burned lower and lower, making the light dance over the many moving faces of Lockhart watching him. Harry moved his aching hand over what felt like the thousandth envelope, writing out Veronica Smethley's address. It must be nearly time to leave, Harry thought miserably, please let it be nearly time...\n\u3000\u3000And then he heard something - something quite apart from the spitting of the dying candles and Lockhart's prattle about his fans.\n\u3000\u3000It was a voice, a voice to chill the bone marrow, a voice of breathtaking, ice-cold venom.\n\u3000\u3000\"Come ... come to me.... Let me rip you.... Let me tear you .... Let me kill you . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry gave a huge jump and a large lilac blot appeared on Veronica Smethley's street.\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" he said loudly.\n\u3000\u3000\"I know!\" said Lockhart. \"Six solid months at the top of the best- seller list! Broke all records!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Harry frantically. \"That voice!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Sorry?\" said Lockhart, looking puzzled. \"What voice?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That - that voice that said - didn't you hear it?\"\n\u3000\u3000Lockhart was looking at Harry in high astonishment.\n\u3000\u3000* 3-2o *\n\u3000\u3000\"What are you talking about, Harry? Perhaps you're getting a litde drowsy? Great Scott - look at the time! We've been here nearly four hours! Id never have believed it - the time's flown, hasn't it?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't answer. He was straining his ears to hear the voice again, but there was no sound now except for Lockhart telling him he mustn't expect a treat like this every time he got detention. Feeling dazed, Harry left.\n\u3000\u3000It was so late that the Gryffindor common room was almost empty. Harry went straight up to the dormitory. Ron wasn't back yet. Harry pulled on his pajamas, got into bed, and waited. Half an hour later, Ron arrived, nursing his right arm and bringing a strong smell of polish into the darkened room.\n\u3000\u3000\"My muscles have all seized up,\" he groaned, sinking on his bed. \"Fourteen times he made me buff up that Quidditch cup before he was satisfied. And then I had another slug attack all over a Special Award for Services to the School. Took ages to get the slime off... How was it with Lockhart?\"\n\u3000\u3000Keeping his voice low so as not to wake Neville, Dean, and Seamus, Harry told Ron exactly what he had heard.\n\u3000\u3000\"And Lockhart said he couldn't hear it?\" said Ron. Harry could see him frowning in the moonlight. \"D'you think he was lying? But I don't get it - even someone invisible would've had to open the door.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I know,\" said Harry, lying back in his four-poster and staring at the canopy above him. \"I don't get it either.\"\n\u3000\u3000* 12-1 *\n\u3000\u3000122\n\u3000\u3000October arrived, spreading a damp chill over the grounds and into the castle. Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was kept busy by a sudden spate of colds among the staff and students. Her Pepperup potion worked instantly, though it left the drinker smoking at the ears for several hours afterward. Ginny Weasley, who had been looking pale, was bullied into taking some by Percy. The steam pouring from under her vivid hair gave the impression that her whole head was on fire.\n\u3000\u3000Raindrops the size of bullets thundered on the castle windows for days on end; the lake rose, the flower beds turned into muddy streams, and Hagrid's pumpkins swelled to the size of garden sheds. Oliver Wood's enthusiasm for regular training sessions, however, was not dampened, which was why Harry was to be found, late one stormy Saturday afternoon a few days before Halloween, returning to Gryffindor Tower, drenched to the skin and splattered with mud..\n\u3000\u3000123\n\u3000\u3000Even aside from the rain and wind it hadn't been a happy practice session.\n\u3000\u3000Fred and George, who had been spying on the Slytherin team, had seen for themselves the speed of those new Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones. They reported that the Slytherin team was no more than seven greenish blurs, shooting through the air like missiles.\n\u3000\u3000As Harry squelched along the deserted corridor he came across somebody who looked just as preoccupied as he was. Nearly Headless Nick, the ghost of Gryffindor Tower, was staring morosely out of a window, muttering under his breath, \". . . don't fulfill their requirements . . . half an inch, if that . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hello, Nick,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hello, hello,\" said Nearly Headless Nick, starting and looking round. He wore a dashing, plumed hat on his long curly hair, and a tunic with a ruff, which concealed the fact that his neck was almost completely severed. He was pale as smoke, and Harry could see right through him to the dark sky and torrential rain outside.\n\u3000\u3000\"You look troubled, young Potter,\" said Nick, folding a transparent letter as he spoke and tucking it inside his doublet.\n\u3000\u3000\"So do you,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah,\" Nearly Headless Nick waved an elegant hand, \"a matter of no importance. . . . It's not as though I really wanted to join. . . . Thought I'd apply, but apparently I 'don't fulfill requirements' -\"\n\u3000\u3000In spite of his airy tone, there was a look of great bitterness on his face.\n\u3000\u3000\"But you would think, wouldn't you,\" he erupted suddenly, pulling the letter back out of his pocket, \"that getting hit forty-five times in the neck with a blunt axe would qualify you to join the Headless Hunt?\"\n\u3000\u3000124\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh - yes,\" said Harry, who was obviously supposed to agree.\n\u3000\u3000\"I mean, nobody wishes more than I do that it had all been quick and clean, and my head had come off properly, I mean, it would have saved me a great deal of pain and ridicule. However -\" Nearly Headless Nick shook his letter open and read furiously: \"'We can only accept huntsmen whose heads have parted company with their bodies. You will appreciate that it would be impossible otherwise for members to participate in hunt activities such as Horseback Head-Juggling and Head Polo. It is with the greatest regret, therefore, that I must inform you that you do not fulfill our requirements.\n\u3000\u3000With very best wishes, Sir Patrick Delaney-Podmore.'\"\n\u3000\u3000Fuming, Nearly Headless Nick stuffed the letter away.\n\u3000\u3000\"Half an inch of skin and sinew holding my neck on, Harry! Most people would think that's good and beheaded, but oh, no, it's not enough for Sir Properly Decapitated-Podmore.\"\n\u3000\u3000Nearly Headless Nick took several deep breaths and then said, in a far calmer tone, \"So - what's bothering you? Anything I can do?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Harry. \"Not unless you know where we can get seven free Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones for our match against Sly -\"\n\u3000\u3000The rest of Harry's sentence was drowned out by a high-pitched mewling from somewhere near his ankles. He looked down and found himself gazing into a pair of lamp-like yellow eyes. It was Mrs. Norris, the skeletal gray cat who was used by the caretaker, Argus Filch, as a sort of deputy in his endless battle against students.\n\u3000\u3000\"You'd better get out of here, Harry,\" said Nick quickly. \"Filch isn't in a good mood - he's got the flu and some third years accidentally plastered frog brains all over the ceiling in dungeon five. He's been cleaning all morning, and if he sees you dripping mud all over the place -\"\n\u3000\u3000.125\n\u3000\u3000\"Right,\" said Harry, backing away from the accusing stare of Mrs. Norris, but not quickly enough. Drawn to the spot by the mysterious power that seemed to connect him with his foul cat, Argus Filch burst suddenly through a tapestry to Harry's right, wheezing and looking wildly about for the rule-breaker.\n\u3000\u3000There was a thick tartan scarf bound around his head, and his nose was unusually purple.\n\u3000\u3000\"Filth!\" he shouted, his jowls aquiver, his eyes popping alarmingly as he pointed at the muddy puddle that had dripped from Harry's Quidditch robes.\n\u3000\u3000\"Mess and muck everywhere! I've had enough of it, I tell you! Follow me, Potter!\"\n\u3000\u3000So Harry waved a gloomy good-bye to Nearly Headless Nick and followed Filch back downstairs, doubling the number of muddy footprints on the floor.\n\u3000\u3000Harry had never been inside Filch's office before; it was a place most students avoided. The room was dingy and windowless, lit by a single oil lamp dangling from the low ceiling. A faint smell of fried fish lingered about the place. Wooden filing cabinets stood around the walls; from their labels, Harry could see that they contained details of every pupil Filch had ever punished. Fred and George Weasley had an entire drawer to themselves. A highly polished collection of chains and manacles hung on the wall behind Filch's desk. It was common knowledge that he was always begging Dumbledore to let him suspend students by their ankles from the ceiling.\n\u3000\u3000Filch grabbed a quill from a pot on his desk and began shuffling around looking for parchment.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dung,\" he muttered furiously, \"great sizzling dragon bogies . . . frog brains . . . rat intestines . . . I've had enough of it . . . make an example . . . where's the form . . . yes . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000.126\n\u3000\u3000He retrieved a large roll of parchment from his desk drawer and stretched it out in front of him, dipping his long black quill into the ink pot.\n\u3000\u3000\"Name . . . Harry Potter. Crime . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It was only a bit of mud!\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's only a bit of mud to you, boy, but to me it's an extra hour scrubbing!\"\n\u3000\u3000shouted Filch, a drip shivering unpleasantly at the end of his bulbous nose.\n\u3000\u3000\"Crime . . . befouling the castle . . . suggested sentence . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000Dabbing at his streaming nose, Filch squinted unpleasantly at Harry who waited with bated breath for his sentence to fall.\n\u3000\u3000But as Filch lowered his quill, there was a great BANG! on the ceiling of the office, which made the oil lamp rattle.\n\u3000\u3000\"PEEVES!\" Filch roared, flinging down his quill in a transport of rage. \"I'll have you this time, I'll have you!\"\n\u3000\u3000And without a backward glance at Harry, Filch ran flat-footed from the office, Mrs. Norris streaking alongside him.\n\u3000\u3000Peeves was the school poltergeist, a grinning, airborne menace who lived to cause havoc and distress. Harry didn't much like Peeves, but couldn't help feeling grateful for his timing. Hopefully, whatever Peeves had done (and it sounded as though he'd wrecked something very big this time) would distract Filch from Harry.\n\u3000\u3000Thinking that he should probably wait for Filch to come back, Harry sank into a moth-eaten chair next to the desk. There was only one thing on it apart from his half-completed form: a large, glossy, purple envelope with silver lettering on the front. With a quick glance at the door to check that Filch wasn't on his way back, Harry picked up the envelope and read: kwikspell A Correspondence Course in Beginners' Magic.\n\u3000\u3000.127\n\u3000\u3000Intrigued, Harry flicked the envelope open and pulled out the sheaf of parchment inside. More curly silver writing on the front page said: Feel out of step in the world of modern magic? Find yourself making excuses not to perform simple spells? Ever been taunted for your woeful wandwork? There is an answer! Kwikspell is an all-new, fail-safe, quick-result, easy-learn course. Hundreds of witches and wizards have benefited from the Kwikspell method! Madam Z. Nettles of Topsham writes: \"I had no memory for incantations and my potions were a family joke! Now, after a Kwikspell course, I am the center of attention at parties and friends beg for the recipe of my Scintillation Solution!\" Warlock D. J. Prod of Didsbury says: \"My wife used to sneer at my feeble charms, but one month into your fabulous Kwikspell course and I succeeded in turning her into a yak! Thank you, Kwikspell!\"\n\u3000\u3000 Fascinated, Harry thumbed through the rest of the envelope's contents. Why on earth did Filch want a Kwikspell course? Did this mean he wasn't a proper wizard? Harry was just reading \"Lesson One: Holding Your Wand (Some Useful Tips)\" when shuffling footsteps outside told him Filch was coming back. Stuffing the parchment back into the envelope, Harry threw it back onto the desk just as the door opened.\n\u3000\u3000Filch was looking triumphant.\n\u3000\u3000\"That vanishing cabinet was extremely valuable!\" he was saying gleefully to Mrs. Norris. \"We'll have Peeves out this time, my sweet -\"\n\u3000\u3000His eyes fell on Harry and then darted to the Kwikspell envelope, which, Harry realized too late, was lying two feet away from where it had started.\n\u3000\u3000Filch's pasty face went brick red. Harry braced himself for a tidal wave of fury. Filch hobbled across to his desk, snatched up the envelope, and threw it into a drawer.\n\u3000\u3000\"Have you - did you read -?\" he sputtered.\n\u3000\u3000.128\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" Harry lied quickly.\n\u3000\u3000Filch's knobbly hands were twisting together.\n\u3000\u3000\"If I thought you'd read my private - not that it's mine - for a friend - be that as it may - however -\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry was staring at him, alarmed; Filch had never looked madder. His eyes were popping, a tic was going in one of his pouchy cheeks, and the tartan scarf didn't help.\n\u3000\u3000\"Very well - go - and don't breathe a word - not that - however, if you didn't read - go now, I have to write up Peeves' report - go -\"\n\u3000\u3000Amazed at his luck, Harry sped out of the office, up the corridor, and back upstairs. To escape from Filch's office without punishment was probably some kind of school record.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry! Harry! Did it work?\"\n\u3000\u3000Nearly Headless Nick came gliding out of a classroom. Behind him, Harry could see the wreckage of a large black-and-gold cabinet that appeared to have been dropped from a great height.\n\u3000\u3000\"I persuaded Peeves to crash it right over Filch's office,\" said Nick eagerly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Thought it might distract him -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Was that you?\" said Harry gratefully. \"Yeah, it worked, I didn't even get detention. Thanks, Nick!\"\n\u3000\u3000They set off up the corridor together. Nearly Headless Nick, Harry noticed, was still holding Sir Patrick's rejection letter..\n\u3000\u3000.129\n\u3000\u3000\"I wish there was something I could do for you about the Headless Hunt,\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry said.\n\u3000\u3000Nearly Headless Nick stopped in his tracks and Harry walked right through him. He wished he hadn't; it was like stepping through an icy shower.\n\u3000\u3000\"But there is something you could do for me,\" said Nick excitedly. \"Harry - would I be asking too much - but no, you wouldn't want -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What is it?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, this Halloween will be my five hundredth deathday,\" said Nearly Headless Nick, drawing himself up and looking dignified.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh,\" said Harry, not sure whether he should look sorry or happy about this.\n\u3000\u3000\"Right.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm holding a party down in one of the roomier dungeons. Friends will be coming from all over the country. It would be such an honor if you would attend. Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger would be most welcome, too, of course - but I daresay you'd rather go to the school feast?\" He watched Harry on tenterhooks.\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Harry quickly, \"I'll come -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"My dear boy! Harry Potter, at my deathday party! And\" - he hesitated, looking excited - \"do you think you could possibly mention to Sir Patrick how very frightening and impressive you find me?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Of - of course,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000Nearly Headless Nick beamed at him. \"A deathday party?\" said Hermione keenly when Harry had changed at last and joined her and Ron in the common room. \"I bet there aren't many living people who can say they've been to one of those - it'll be fascinating!\".\n\u3000\u3000.130\n\u3000\u3000\"Why would anyone want to celebrate the day they died?\" said Ron, who was halfway through his Potions homework and grumpy. \"Sounds dead depressing to me. . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000Rain was still lashing the windows, which were now inky black, but inside all looked bright and cheerful. The firelight glowed over the countless squashy armchairs where people sat reading, talking, doing homework or, in the case of Fred and George Weasley, trying to find out what would happen if you fed a Filibuster firework to a salamander. Fred had \"rescued\" the brilliant orange, fire-dwelling lizard from a Care of Magical Creatures class and it was now smouldering gently on a table surrounded by a knot of curious people.\n\u3000\u3000Harry was at the point of telling Ron and Hermione about Filch and the Kwikspell course when the salamander suddenly whizzed into the air, emitting loud sparks and bangs as it whirled wildly round the room. The sight of Percy bellowing himself hoarse at Fred and George, the spectacular display of tangerine stars showering from the salamander's mouth, and its escape into the fire, with accompanying explosions, drove both Filch and the Kwikspell envelope from Harry's mind. By the time Halloween arrived, Harry was regretting his rash promise to go to the deathday party. The rest of the school was happily anticipating their Halloween feast; the Great Hall had been decorated with the usual live bats, Hagrid's vast pumpkins had been carved into lanterns large enough for three men to sit in, and there were rumors that Dumbledore had booked a troupe of dancing skeletons for the entertainment.\n\u3000\u3000\"A promise is a promise,\" Hermione reminded Harry bossily. \"You said you'd go to the deathday party.\"\n\u3000\u3000So at seven o'clock, Harry, Ron, and Hermione walked straight past the doorway to the packed Great Hall, which was glittering invitingly with gold plates and candles, and directed their steps instead toward the dungeons.\n\u3000\u3000.131\n\u3000\u3000The passageway leading to Nearly Headless Nick's party had been lined with candles, too, though the effect was far from cheerful: These were long, thin, jet-black tapers, all burning bright blue, casting a dim, ghostly light even over their own living faces. The temperature dropped with every step they took. As Harry shivered and drew his robes tightly around him, he heard what sounded like a thousand fingernails scraping an enormous blackboard.\n\u3000\u3000\"Is that supposed to be music?\" Ron whispered. They turned a corner and saw Nearly Headless Nick standing at a doorway hung with black velvet drapes.\n\u3000\u3000\"My dear friends,\" he said mournfully. \"Welcome, welcome . . . so pleased you could come. . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000He swept off his plumed hat and bowed them inside.\n\u3000\u3000It was an incredible sight. The dungeon was full of hundreds of pearly-white, translucent people, mostly drifting around a crowded dance floor, waltzing to the dreadful, quavering sound of thirty musical saws, played by an orchestra on a raised, black-draped platform. A chandelier overhead blazed midnight-blue with a thousand more black candles. Their breath rose in a mist before them; it was like stepping into a freezer.\n\u3000\u3000\"Shall we have a look around?\" Harry suggested, wanting to warm up his feet.\n\u3000\u3000\"Careful not to walk through anyone,\" said Ron nervously, and they set off around the edge of the dance floor. They passed a group of gloomy nuns, a ragged man wearing chains, and the Fat Friar, a cheerful Hufflepuff ghost, who was talking to a knight with an arrow sticking out of his forehead. Harry wasn't surprised to see that the Bloody Baron, a gaunt, staring Slytherin ghost covered in silver bloodstains, was being given a wide berth by the other ghosts.\n\u3000\u3000.132\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, no,\" said Hermione, stopping abruptly. \"Turn back, turn back, I don't want to talk to Moaning Myrtle -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Who?\" said Harry as they backtracked quickly.\n\u3000\u3000\"She haunts one of the toilets in the girls' bathroom on the first floor,\" said Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"She haunts a toilet?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes. It's been out-of-order all year because she keeps having tantrums and flooding the place. I never went in there anyway if I could avoid it; it's awful trying to have a pee with her wailing at you -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Look, food!\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000On the other side of the dungeon was a long table, also covered in black velvet. They approached it eagerly but next moment had stopped in their tracks, horrified. The smell was quite disgusting. Large, rotten fish were laid on handsome silver platters; cakes, burned charcoal-black, were heaped on salvers; there was a great maggoty haggis, a slab of cheese covered in furry green mold and, in pride of place, an enormous gray cake in the shape of a tombstone, with tar-like icing forming the words, Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington died 31st October, 1492 Harry watched, amazed, as a portly ghost approached the table, crouched low, and walked through it, his mouth held wide so that it passed through one of the stinking salmon.\n\u3000\u3000\"Can you taste it if you walk though it?\" Harry asked him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Almost,\" said the ghost sadly, and he drifted away.\n\u3000\u3000.133\n\u3000\u3000\"I expect they've let it rot to give it a stronger flavor,\" said Hermione knowledgeably, pinching her nose and leaning closer to look at the putrid haggis.\n\u3000\u3000\"Can we move? I feel sick,\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000They had barely turned around, however, when a little man swooped suddenly from under the table and came to a halt in midair before them.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hello, Peeves,\" said Harry cautiously.\n\u3000\u3000Unlike the ghosts around them, Peeves the Poltergeist was the very reverse of pale and transparent. He was wearing a bright orange party hat, a revolving bow tie, and a broad grin on his wide, wicked face.\n\u3000\u3000\"Nibbles?\" he said sweetly, offering them a bowl of peanuts covered in fungus.\n\u3000\u3000\"No thanks,\" said Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"Heard you talking about poor Myrtle,\" said Peeves, his eyes dancing.\n\u3000\u3000\"Rude you was about poor Myrtle.\" He took a deep breath and bellowed, \"OY! MYRTLE!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, no, Peeves, don't tell her what I said, she'll be really upset,\" Hermione whispered frantically. \"I didn't mean it, I don't mind her - er, hello, Myrtle.\"\n\u3000\u3000The squat ghost of a girl had glided over. She had the glummest face Harry had ever seen, half-hidden behind lank hair and thick, pearly spectacles.\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" she said sulkily.\n\u3000\u3000\"How are you, Myrtle?\" said Hermione in a falsely bright voice. \"It's nice to see you out of the toilet.\"\n\u3000\u3000.134\n\u3000\u3000Myrtle sniffed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Miss Granger was just talking about you -\" said Peeves slyly in Myrtle's ear.\n\u3000\u3000\"Just saying - saying - how nice you look tonight,\" said Hermione, glaring at Peeves.\n\u3000\u3000Myrtle eyed Hermione suspiciously.\n\u3000\u3000\"You're making fun of me,\" she said, silver tears welling rapidly in her small, see-through eyes.\n\u3000\u3000\"No - honestly - didn't I just say how nice Myrtle's looking?\" said Hermione, nudging Harry and Ron painfully in the ribs.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, yeah -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"She did -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't lie to me,\" Myrtle gasped, tears now flooding down her face, while Peeves chuckled happily over her shoulder. \"D'you think I don't know what people call me behind my back? Fat Myrtle! Ugly Myrtle! Miserable, moaning, moping Myrtle!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You've forgotten pimply,\" Peeves hissed in her ear.\n\u3000\u3000Moaning Myrtle burst into anguished sobs and fled from the dungeon.\n\u3000\u3000Peeves shot after her, pelting her with moldy peanuts, yelling, \"Pimply!\n\u3000\u3000Pimply!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, dear,\" said Hermione sadly.\n\u3000\u3000Nearly Headless Nick now drifted toward them through the crowd.\n\u3000\u3000.135\n\u3000\u3000\"Enjoying yourselves?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, yes,\" they lied.\n\u3000\u3000\"Not a bad turnout,\" said Nearly Headless Nick proudly. \"The Wailing Widow came all the way up from Kent. . . . It's nearly time for my speech, I'd better go and warn the orchestra. . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000The orchestra, however, stopped playing at that very moment. They, and everyone else in the dungeon, fell silent, looking around in excitement, as a hunting horn sounded.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, here we go,\" said Nearly Headless Nick bitterly.\n\u3000\u3000Through the dungeon wall burst a dozen ghost horses, each ridden by a headless horseman. The assembly clapped wildly; Harry started to clap, too, but stopped quickly at the sight of Nick's face.\n\u3000\u3000The horses galloped into the middle of the dance floor and halted, rearing and plunging. At the front of the pack was a large ghost who held his bearded head under his arm, from which position he was blowing the horn.\n\u3000\u3000The ghost leapt down, lifted his head high in the air so he could see over the crowd (everyone laughed), and strode over to Nearly Headless Nick, squashing his head back onto his neck.\n\u3000\u3000\"Nick!\" he roared. \"How are you? Head still hanging in there?\"\n\u3000\u3000He gave a hearty guffaw and clapped Nearly Headless Nick on the shoulder.\n\u3000\u3000\"Welcome, Patrick,\" said Nick stiffly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Live 'uns!\" said Sir Patrick, spotting Harry, Ron, and Hermione and giving a huge, fake jump of astonishment, so that his head fell off again (the crowd howled with laughter).\n\u3000\u3000.136\n\u3000\u3000\"Very amusing,\" said Nearly Headless Nick darkly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't mind Nick!\" shouted Sir Patrick's head from the floor. \"Still upset we won't let him join the Hunt! But I mean to say - look at the fellow -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I think,\" said Harry hurriedly, at a meaningful look from Nick, \"Nick's very - frightening and - er -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ha!\" yelled Sir Patrick's head. \"Bet he asked you to say that!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"If I could have everyone's attention, it's time for my speech!\" said Nearly Headless Nick loudly, striding toward the podium and climbing into an icy blue spotlight.\n\u3000\u3000\"My late lamented lords, ladies, and gentlemen, it is my great sorrow . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000But nobody heard much more. Sir Patrick and the rest of the Headless Hunt had just started a game of Head Hockey and the crowd were turning to watch. Nearly Headless Nick tried vainly to recapture his audience, but gave up as Sir Patrick's head went sailing past him to loud cheers.\n\u3000\u3000Harry was very cold by now, not to mention hungry.\n\u3000\u3000\"I can't stand much more of this,\" Ron muttered, his teeth chattering, as the orchestra ground back into action and the ghosts swept back onto the dance floor.\n\u3000\u3000\"Let's go,\" Harry agreed.\n\u3000\u3000They backed toward the door, nodding and beaming at anyone who looked at them, and a minute later were hurrying back up the passageway full of black candles.\n\u3000\u3000\"Pudding might not be finished yet,\" said Ron hopefully, leading the way toward the steps to the entrance hall.\n\u3000\u3000.137\n\u3000\u3000And then Harry heard it.\n\u3000\u3000\". . . rip . . . tear . . . kill . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000It was the same voice, the same cold, murderous voice he had heard in Lockhart's office.\n\u3000\u3000He stumbled to a halt, clutching at the stone wall, listening with all his might, looking around, squinting up and down the dimly lit passageway.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, what're you -?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It's that voice again - shut up a minute -\"\n\u3000\u3000\". . . soo hungry . . . for so long . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Listen!\" said Harry urgently, and Ron and Hermione froze, watching him.\n\u3000\u3000\". . . kill . . . time to kill . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000The voice was growing fainter. Harry was sure it was moving away - moving upward. A mixture of fear and excitement gripped him as he stared at the dark ceiling; how could it be moving upward? Was it a phantom, to whom stone ceilings didn't matter?\n\u3000\u3000\"This way,\" he shouted, and he began to run, up the stairs, into the entrance hall. It was no good hoping to hear anything here, the babble of talk from the Halloween feast was echoing out of the Great Hall. Harry sprinted up the marble staircase to the first floor, Ron and Hermione clattering behind him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, what're we -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"SHH!\"\n\u3000\u3000.138\n\u3000\u3000Harry strained his ears. Distantly, from the floor above, and growing fainter still, he heard the voice: \". . . I smell blood. . . . I SMELL BLOOD!\"\n\u3000\u3000His stomach lurched - \"It's going to kill someone!\" he shouted, and ignoring Ron's and Hermione's bewildered faces, he ran up the next flight of steps three at a time, trying to listen over his own pounding footsteps - Harry hurtled around the whole of the second floor, Ron and Hermione panting behind him, not stopping until they turned a corner into the last, deserted passage.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, what was that all about?\" said Ron, wiping sweat off his face. \"I couldn't hear anything. . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000But Hermione gave a sudden gasp, pointing down the corridor.\n\u3000\u3000\"Look!\"\n\u3000\u3000Something was shining on the wall ahead. They approached slowly, squinting through the darkness. Foot-high words had been daubed on the wall between two windows, shimmering in the light cast by the flaming torches. the chamber of secrets has been opened. enemies of the heir, beware.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's that thing - hanging underneath?\" said Ron, a slight quiver in his voice.\n\u3000\u3000As they edged nearer, Harry almost slipped - there was a large puddle of water on the floor; Ron and Hermione grabbed him, and they inched toward the message, eyes fixed on a dark shadow beneath it. All three of them realized what it was at once, and leapt backward with a splash..Mrs. Norris,\n\u3000\u3000the caretaker's cat, was hanging by her tail from the torch bracket. She was stiff as a board, her eyes wide and staring.\n\u3000\u3000For a few seconds, they didn't move. Then Ron said, \"Let's get out of here.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Shouldn't we try and help -\" Harry began awkwardly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Trust me,\" said Ron. \"We don't want to be found here.\"\n\u3000\u3000But it was too late. A rumble, as though of distant thunder, told them that the feast had just ended. From either end of the corridor where they stood came the sound of hundreds of feet climbing the stairs, and the loud, happy talk of well-fed people; next moment, students were crashing into the passage from both ends.\n\u3000\u3000The chatter, the bustle, the noise died suddenly as the people in front spotted the hanging cat. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood alone, in the middle of the corridor, as silence fell among the mass of students pressing forward to see the grisly sight.\n\u3000\u3000Then someone shouted through the quiet.\n\u3000\u3000\"Enemies of the Heir, beware! You'll be next, Mudbloods!\"\n\u3000\u3000It was Draco Malfoy. He had pushed to the front of the crowd, his cold eyes alive, his usually bloodless face flushed, as he grinned at the sight of the hanging, immobile cat.\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER NINE\n\u3000\u3000THE WRTITING ON THE WALL\n\u3000\u3000What's going on here? What's going on?\" Attracted no doubt by Malfoy's shout, Argus Filch came shouldering his way through the crowd. Then he saw Mrs. Norris and fell back, clutching his face in horror.\n\u3000\u3000\"My cat! My cat! What's happened to Mrs. Norris?\" he shrieked.\n\u3000\u3000And his popping eyes fell on Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"You!\"he screeched. \"You! You've murdered my cat! You've killed her! I'll kill you! I'll -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Argus!\"\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore had arrived on the scene, followed by a number of other teachers. In seconds, he had swept past Harry, Ron, and Hermione and detached Mrs. Norris from the torch bracket.\n\u3000\u3000\"Come with me, Argus,\" he said to Filch. \"You, too, Mr. Potter, Mr. Weasley, Miss Granger.\"\n\u3000\u3000Lockhart stepped forward eagerly.\n\u3000\u3000*140*\n\u3000\u3000\"My office is nearest, Headmaster - just upstairs - please feel free -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Thank you, Gilderoy,\" said Dumbledore.\n\u3000\u3000The silent crowd parted to let them pass. Lockhart, looking excited and important, hurried after Dumbledore; so did Professors McGonagall and Snape.\n\u3000\u3000As they entered Lockhart's darkened office there was a flurry of movement across the walls; Harry saw several of the Lockharts in the pictures dodging out of sight, their hair in rollers. The real Lockhart lit the candles on his desk and stood back. Dumbledore lay Mrs. Norris on the polished surface and began to examine her. Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged tense looks and sank into chairs outside the pool of candlelight, watching.\n\u3000\u3000The tip of Dumbledore's long, crooked nose was barely an inch from Mrs. Norris's fur. He was looking at her closely through his half-moon spectacles, his long fingers gently prodding and poking. Professor McGonagall was bent almost as close, her eyes narrowed. Snape loomed behind them, half in shadow, wearing a most peculiar expression: It was as though he was trying hard not to smile. And Lockhart was hovering around all of them, making suggestions.\n\u3000\u3000\"It was definitely a curse that killed her - probably the Transmogrifian Torture - I've seen it used many times, so unlucky I wasn't there, I know the very countercurse that would have saved her . .....\n\u3000\u3000Lockhart's comments were punctuated by Filch's dry, racking sobs. He was slumped in a chair by the desk, unable to look at Mrs. Norris, his face in his hands. Much as he detested Filch, Harry\n\u3000\u3000*141*\n\u3000\u3000couldn't help feeling a bit sorry for him, though not nearly as sorry as he felt for himself If Dumbledore believed Filch, he would be expelled for sure.\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore was now muttering strange words under his breath and tapping Mrs. Norris with his wand but nothing happened: She continued to look as though she had been recently stuffed.\n\u3000\u3000\". . . I remember something very similar happening in Ouagadogou,\" said Lockhart, \"a series of attacks, the full story's in my autobiography, I was able to provide the townsfolk with various amulets, which cleared the matter up at once ......\n\u3000\u3000The photographs of Lockhart on the walls were all nodding in agreement as he talked. One of them had forgotten to remove his hair net.\n\u3000\u3000At last Dumbledore straightened up.\n\u3000\u3000\"She's not dead, Argus,\" he said softly.\n\u3000\u3000Lockhart stopped abruptly in the middle of counting the number of murders he had prevented.\n\u3000\u3000\"Not dead?\" choked Filch, looking through his fingers at Mrs. Norris. \"But why's she all - all stiff and frozen?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"She has been Petrified,\" said Dumbledore (\"Ah! I thought so!\" said Lockhart). \"But how, I cannot say . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ask him!\" shrieked Filch, turning his blotched and tearstained face to Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"No second year could have done this,\" said Dumbledore firmly. \"it would take Dark Magic of the most advanced -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He did it, he did it!\" Filch spat, his pouchy face purpling. \"You saw what he wrote on the wall! He found - in my office - he knows I'm a - I'm a -\" Filch's face worked horribly. \"He knows I'm a Squib!\" he finished.\n\u3000\u3000142\n\u3000\u3000\"I never touched Mrs. Norris!\" Harry said loudly, uncomfortably aware of everyone looking at him, including all the Lockharts on the walls. \"And I don't even know what a Squib is.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Rubbish!\" snarled Filch. \"He saw my Kwikspell letter!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"If I might speak, Headmaster,\" said Snape from the shadows, and Harry's sense of forboding increased; he was sure nothing Snape had to say was going to do him any good.\n\u3000\u3000\"Potter and his friends may have simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time,\" he said, a slight sneer curling his mouth as though he doubted it. \"But we do have a set of suspicious circumstances here. Why was he in the upstairs corridor at all? Why wasn't he at the Halloween feast?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry, Ron and Hermione all launched into an explanation about the deathday party. \". . . there were hundreds of ghosts, theyll tell you we were there -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But why not join the feast afterward?\" said Snape, his black eyes glittering in the candlelight. \"Why go up to that corridor?\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron and Hermione looked at Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Because - because -\" Harry said, his heart thumping very fast; something told him it would sound very far-fetched if he told them he had been led there by a bodiless voice no one but he could hear, \"because we were tired and wanted to go to bed,\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000\"Without any supper?\" said Snape, a triumphant smile flickering across his gaunt face. \"I didn't think ghosts provided food fit for living people at their parties.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We weren't hungry,\" said Ron loudly as his stomach gave a huge rumble.\n\u3000\u3000Snape's nasty smile widened.\n\u3000\u3000*143*\n\u3000\u3000\"I suggest, Headmaster, that Potter is not being entirely truthful,\" he said. \"It might be a good idea if he were deprived of certain privileges until he is ready to tell us the whole story. I personally feel he should be taken off the Gryffindor Quidditch team until he is ready to be honest.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Really, Severus,\" said Professor McGonagall sharply, \"I see no reason to stop the boy playing Quidditch. This cat wasn't hit over the head with a broomstick. There is no evidence at all that Potter has done anything wrong.\"\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore was giving Harry a searching look. His twinkling light- blue gaze made Harry feel as though he were being X-rayed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Innocent until proven guilty, Severus,\" he said firmly.\n\u3000\u3000Snape looked furious. So did Filch.\n\u3000\u3000\"My cat has been Petrified!\" he shrieked, his eyes popping. \"I want to see some punishment!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We will be able to cure her, Argus,\" said Dumbledore patiently. \"Professer Sprout recently managed to procure some Mandrakes. As soon as they have reached their full size, I will have a potion made that will revive Mrs. Norris.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll make it,\" Lockhart butted in. \"I must have done it a hundred times. I could whip up a Mandrake Restorative Draught in my sleep -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Excuse me,\" said Snape icily. \"But I believe I am the Potions master at this school.\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a very awkward pause.\n\u3000\u3000\"You may go,\" Dumbledore said to Harry, Ron, and Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000They went, as quickly as they could without actually running. When they were a floor up from Lockhart's office, they turned into\n\u3000\u3000*144*\n\u3000\u3000an empty classroom and closed the door quietly behind them. Harry squinted at his friends' darkened faces.\n\u3000\u3000\"D'you think I should have told them about that voice I heard?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Ron, without hesitation. \"Hearing voices no one else can hear isn't a good sign, even in the wizarding world.\"\n\u3000\u3000Something in Ron's voice made Harry ask, \"You do believe me, don't you?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"'Course I do,\" said Ron quickly. \"But -you must admit it's weird ......\n\u3000\u3000\"I know it's weird,\" said Harry. \"The whole thing's weird. What was that writing on the wall about? The Cbamber Has Been Opened... What's that supposed to mean?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You know, it rings a sort of bell,\" said Ron slowly. \"I think someone told me a story about a secret chamber at Hogwarts once ... might've been Bill . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"And what on earth's a Squib?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000To his surprise, Ron stifled a snigger.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well - it's not funny really - but as it's Filch, he said. \"A Squib is someone who was born into a wizarding family but hasn't got any magic powers. Kind of the opposite of Muggle-born wizards, but Squibs are quite unusual. If Filch's trying to learn magic from a Kwikspell course, I reckon he must be a Squib. It would explain a lot. Like why he hates students so much.\" Ron gave a satisfied smile. \"He's bitter.\"\n\u3000\u3000A clock chimed somewhere.\n\u3000\u3000\"Midnight,\" said Harry. \"We'd better get to bed before Snape comes along and tries to frame us for something else.\"\n\u3000\u3000*145*\n\u3000\u3000For a few days, the school could talk of little else but the attack on Mrs. Norris. Filch kept it fresh in everyone's minds by pacing the spot where she had been attacked, as though he thought the attacker might come back. Harry had seen him scrubbing the message on the wall with Mrs. Skower's All-Purpose Magical Mess Remover, but to no effect; the words still gleamed as brightly as ever on the stone. When Filch wasn't guarding the scene of the crime, he was skulking red- eyed through the corridors, lunging out at unsuspecting students and trying to put them in detention for things like \"breathing loudly' and \"looking happy.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ginny Weasley seemed very disturbed by Mrs. Norris's fate. According to Ron, she was a great cat lover.\n\u3000\u3000\"But you haven't really got to know Mrs. Norris,\" Ron told her bracingly. \"Honestly, we're much better off without her.\" Ginny's lip trembled. \"Stuff like this doesn't often happen at Hogwarts,\" Ron assured her. \"They'll catch the maniac who did it and have him out of here in no time. I just hope he's got time to Petrify Filch before he's expelled. I'm only joking -\" Ron added hastily as Ginny blanched.\n\u3000\u3000The attack had also had an effect on Hermione. It was quite usual for Hermione to spend a lot of time reading, but she was now doing almost nothing else. Nor could Harry and Ron get much response from her when they asked what she was up to, and not until the following Wednesday did they find out.\n\u3000\u3000Harry had been held back in Potions, where Snape had made him stay behind to scrape tubeworms off the desks. After a hurried lunch, he went upstairs to meet Ron in the library, and saw Justin Finch- Fletchley, the Hufflepuff boy from Herbology, coming\n\u3000\u3000*146*\n\u3000\u3000toward him. Harry had just opened his mouth to say hello when Justin caught sight of him, turned abruptly, and sped off in the opposite direction.\n\u3000\u3000Harry found Ron at the back of the library, measuring his History of Magic homework. Professor Binns had asked for a threefoot-long composition on \"The Medieval Assembly of European\n\u3000\u3000Wizards.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't believe it, I'm still eight inches short\tsaid Ron fu\n\u3000\u3000riously, letting go of his parchment, which sprang back into a roll. \"And Hermione's done four feet seven inches and her writing's tiny. \"\n\u3000\u3000\"Where is she?\" asked Harry, grabbing the tape measure and unrolling his own homework.\n\u3000\u3000\"Somewhere over there,\" said Ron, pointing along the shelves. \"Looking for another book. I think she's trying to read the whole library before Christmas.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry told Ron about Justin Finch-Fletchley running away from him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dunno why you care. I thought he was a bit of an idiot,\" said Ron, scribbling away, making his writing as large as possible. \"All that junk about Lockhart being so great -\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione emerged from between the bookshelves. She looked irritable and at last seemed ready to talk to them.\n\u3000\u3000\"All the copies of Hogwarts, A History have been taken out,\" she said, sitting down next to Harry and Ron. \"And there's a two-week waiting list. I wish I hadn't left my copy at home, but I couldn't fit it in my trunk with all the Lockhart books.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Why do you want it?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000*141*\n\u3000\u3000\"The same reason everyone else wants it,\" said Hermione, \"to read up on the legend of the Chamber of Secrets.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What's that?\" said Harry quickly.\n\u3000\u3000\"That's just it. I can't remember,\" said Hermione, biting her lip. \"And I can't find the story anywhere else -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione, let me read your composition,\" said Ron desperately, checking his watch.\n\u3000\u3000\"No, I won't,\" said Hermione, suddenly severe. \"You've had ten days to finish it -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I only need another two inches, come on -\"\n\u3000\u3000The bell rang. Ron and Hermione led the way to History of Magic, bickering.\n\u3000\u3000History of Magic was the dullest subject on their schedule. Professor Binns, who taught it, was their only ghost teacher, and the most exciting thing that ever happened in his classes was his entering the room through the blackboard. Ancient and shriveled, many people said he hadn't noticed he was dead. He had simply got up to teach one day and left his body behind him in an armchair in front of the staff room fire; his routine had not varied in the slightest since.\n\u3000\u3000Today was as boring as ever. Professor Binns opened his notes and began to read in a flat drone like an old vacuum cleaner until nearly everyone in the class was in a deep stupor, occasionally coming to long enough to copy down a name or date, then falling asleep again. He had been speaking for half an hour when something happened that had never happened before. Hermione put up her hand.\n\u3000\u3000Professor Binns, glancing up in the middle of a deadly dull lec\n\u3000\u3000*148*\n\u3000\u3000ture on the International Warlock Convention of 1289, looked amazed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Miss - er -?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Granger, Professor. I was wondering if you could tell us anything about the Chamber of Secrets,\" said Hermione in a clear voice.\n\u3000\u3000Dean Thomas, who had been sitting with his mouth hanging open, gazing out of the window, jerked out of his trance; Lavender Brown's head came up off her arms and Neville Longbottom's elbow slipped off his desk.\n\u3000\u3000Professor Binns blinked.\n\u3000\u3000\"My subject is History of Magic,\" he said in his dry, wheezy voice. \"I deal with facts, Miss Granger, not myths and legends.\" He cleared his throat with a small noise like chalk s!-ping and continued, \"In September of that year, a subcommittee of Sardinian sorcerers\n\u3000\u3000\"\n\u3000\u3000He stuttered to a halt. Hermione's hand was waving in the air again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Miss Grant?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Please, sir, don't legends always have a basis in fact?\"\n\u3000\u3000Professor Binns was looking at her in such amazement, Harry was sure no student had ever interrupted him before, alive or dead.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well,\" said Professor Binns slowly, \"yes, one could argue that, I suppose.\" He peered at Hermione as though he had never seen a student properly before. \"However, the legend of which you speak is such a very sensational, even ludicrous tale -\"\n\u3000\u3000But the whole class was now hanging on Professor Binns's every word. He looked dimly at them all, every face turned to his. Harry\n\u3000\u3000*149*\n\u3000\u3000could tell he was completely thrown by such an unusual show of interest.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, very well,\" he said slowly. \"Let me see ... the Chamber of Secrets ...\n\u3000\u3000\"You all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago - the precise date is uncertain - by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age. The four school Houses are named after them: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. They built this castle together, far from prying Muggle eyes, for it was an age when magic was feared by common people, and witches and wizards suffered much persecution.\"\n\u3000\u3000He paused, gazed blearily around the room, and continued.\n\u3000\u3000\"For a few years, the founders worked in harmony together, seeking out youngsters who showed signs of magic and bringing them to the castle to be educated. But then disagreements sprang up between them. A rift began to grow between Slytherin and the others. Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed that magical learning should be kept within all-magic families. He disliked taking students of Muggle parentage, believing them to be untrustworthy. After a while, there was a serious argument on the subject between Slytherin and Gryffindor, and Slytherin left the school.\"\n\u3000\u3000Professor Binns paused again, pursing his lips, looking like a wrinkled old tortoise.\n\u3000\u3000\"Reliable historical sources tell us this much,\" he said. \"But these honest facts have been obscured by the fanciful legend of the Chamber of Secrets. The story goes that Slytherin had built a\n\u3000\u3000*150*\n\u3000\u3000hidden chamber in the castle, of which the other founders knew nothing.\n\u3000\u3000\"Slytherin, according to the legend, sealed the Chamber of Secrets so that none would be able to open it until his own true heir arrived at the school. The heir alone would be able to unseal the Chamber of Secrets, unleash the horror within, and use it to purge the school of all who were unworthy to study magic.\"\n\u3000\u3000There was silence as he finished telling the story, but it wasn't the usual, sleepy silence that filled Professor Binns's classes. There was unease in the air as everyone continued to watch him, hoping for more. Professor Binns looked faintly annoyed.\n\u3000\u3000\"The whole thing is arrant nonsense, of course,\" he said. \"Naturally, the school has been searched for evidence of such a chamber, many times, by the most learned witches and wizards. It does not exist. A tale told to frighten the gullible.\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione's hand was back in the air.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sir - what exactly do you mean by the `horror within' the Chamber?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That is believed to be some sort of monster, which the Heir of Slytherin alone can control,\" said Professor Binns in his dry, reedy voice.\n\u3000\u3000The class exchanged nervous looks.\n\u3000\u3000\"I tell you, the thing does not exist,\" said Professor Binns, shuffling his notes. \"There is no Chamber and no monster.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But, sir,\" said Seamus Finnigan, \"if the Chamber can only be opened by Slytherin's true heir, no one else would be able to find it, would they?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Nonsense, O'Flaherty,\" said Professor Binns in an aggravated\n\u3000\u3000*151*\n\u3000\u3000tone. \"If a long succession of Hogwarts headmasters and headmistresses haven't found the thing -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But, Professor,\" piped up Parvati Patil, \"you'd probably have to use Dark Magic to open it -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Just because a wizard doesn't use Dark Magic doesn't mean he can't, Miss Pennyfeather,\" snapped Professor Binns. \"I repeat, if the likes of Dumbledore -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But maybe you've got to be related to Slytherin, so Dumbledore couldn't -\" began Dean Thomas, but Professor Binns had had enough.\n\u3000\u3000\"That will do,\" he said sharply. \"It is a myth! It does not exist! There is not a shred of evidence that Slytherin ever built so much as a secret broom cupboard! I regret telling you such a foolish story! We will return, if you please, to history, to solid, believable, verifiable fact!\"\n\u3000\u3000And within five minutes, the class had sunk back into its usual torpor.\n\u3000\u3000\"I always knew Salazar Slytherin was a twisted old loony,\" Ron told Harry and Hermione as they fought their way through the teeming corridors at the end of the lesson to drop off their bags before dinner. \"But I never knew he started all this pure-blood stuff. I wouldn't be in his house if you paid me. Honestly, if the Sorting Hat had tried to put me in Slytherin, I'd've got the train straight back home ......\n\u3000\u3000Hermione nodded fervently, but Harry didn't say anything. His stomach had just dropped unpleasantly.\n\u3000\u3000Harry had never told Ron and Hermione that the Sorting Hat\n\u3000\u3000*152*\n\u3000\u3000had seriously considered putting him in Slytherin. He could remember, as though it were yesterday, the small voice that had spoken in his ear when he'd placed the hat on his head a year before: You could be great, you know, it's all here in your head, and Slytherin would help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that...\n\u3000\u3000But Harry, who had already heard of Slytherin House's reputa\n\u3000\u3000tion for turning out Dark wizards, had thought desperately, Not Slytherin! and the hat had said, Oh, well, if you're sure ... better be Gryffindor...\n\u3000\u3000As they were shunted along in the throng, Colin Creevy went past.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hiya, Harry!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hullo, Colin,\" said Harry automatically.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry - Harry - a boy in my class has been saying you're\n\u3000\u3000But Colin was so small he couldn~t fight against the tide of people bearing him toward the Great Hall; they heard him squeak, \"See you, Harry!\" and he was gone.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's a boy in his class saying about you?\" Hermione wondered.\n\u3000\u3000\"That I'm Slytherin's heir, I expect,\" said Harry, his stomach dropping another inch or so as he suddenly remembered the way Justin Finch- Fletchley had run away from him at lunchtime.\n\u3000\u3000\"People here'll believe anything,\" said Ron in disgust.\n\u3000\u3000The crowd thinned and they were able to climb the next staircase without difficulty.\n\u3000\u3000\"D'you really think there's a Chamber of Secrets?\" Ron asked Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't know,\" she said, frowning. \"Dumbledore couldn't cure\n\u3000\u3000* 1,5 % *\n\u3000\u3000Mrs. Norris, and that makes me think that whatever attacked her might not be - well - human.\"\n\u3000\u3000As she spoke, they turned a corner and found themselves at the end of the very corridor where the attack had happened. They stopped and looked. The scene was just as it had been that night, except that there was no stiff cat hanging from the torch bracket, and an empty chair stood against the wall bearing the message \"The Chamber of Secrets has been Opened.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That's where Filch has been keeping guard,\" Ron muttered.\n\u3000\u3000They looked at each other. The corridor was deserted.\n\u3000\u3000\"Can't hurt to have a poke around,\" said Harry, dropping his bag and getting to his hands and knees so that he could crawl along, searching for clues.\n\u3000\u3000\"Scorch marks!\" he said. \"Here - and here -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Come and look at this!\" said Hermione. \"This is funny . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry got up and crossed to the window next to the message on the wall. Hermione was pointing at the topmost pane, where around twenty spiders were scuttling, apparently fighting to get through a small crack. A long, silvery thread was dangling like a rope, as though they had all climbed it in their hurry to get outside.\n\u3000\u3000\"Have you ever seen spiders act like that?\" said Hermione wonderingly.\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Harry, \"have you, Ron? Ron?\"\n\u3000\u3000He looked over his shoulder. Ron was standing well back and seemed to be fighting the impulse to run.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's up?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"I - don't - like - spiders,\" said Ron tensely.\n\u3000\u3000\"I never knew that,\" said Hermione, looking at Ron in surprise. \"You've used spiders in Potions loads of times ......\n\u3000\u3000*154*\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't mind them dead,\" said Ron, who was carefully looking anywhere but at the window. \"I just don't like the way they move ....\n\u3000\u3000Hermione giggled.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's not funny,\" said Ron, fiercely. \"If you must know, when I was three, Fred turned my - my teddy bear into a great big fiIthy spider because I broke his toy broomstick .... You wouldn't like them either if you'd been holding your bear and suddenly it had too many legs and. . . \"\n\u3000\u3000He broke off, shuddering. Hermione was obviously still trying not to laugh. Feeling they had better get off the subject, Harry said, \"Remember all that water on the floor? Where did that come from? Someone's mopped it up.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It was about here,\" said Ron, recovering himself to walk a few paces past Filch's chair and pointing. \"Level with this door.\"\n\u3000\u3000He reached for the brass doorknob but suddenly withdrew his hand as though he'd been burned.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's the matter?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Can't go in there,\" said Ron gruffly. \"That's a girls' toilet.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, Ron, there won't be anyone in there,\" said Hermione, standing up and coming over. \"That's Moaning Myrtle's place. Come on, let's have a look.\"\n\u3000\u3000And ignoring the large OUT of ORDER sign, she opened the door.\n\u3000\u3000It was the gloomiest, most depressing bathroom Harry had ever set foot in. Under a large, cracked, and spotted mirror were a row of chipped sinks. The floor was damp and reflected the dull light given off by the stubs of a few candles, burning low in their holders; the wooden doors to the stalls were flaking and scratched and one of them was dangling off its hinges.\n\u3000\u3000* -L 5,5\n\u3000\u3000Hermione put her fingers to her lips and set off toward the end stall. When she reached it she said, \"Hello, Myrtle, how are you?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron went to look. Moaning Myrtle was floating above the tank of the toilet, picking a spot on her chin.\n\u3000\u3000\"This is a girls' bathroom,\" she said, eyeing Ron and Harry suspiciously. \"They're not girls.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" Hermione agreed. \"I just wanted to show them how er - nice it is in here.\"\n\u3000\u3000She waved vaguely at the dirty old mirror and the damp floor.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ask her if she saw anything,\" Harry mouthed at Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"What are you whispering?\" said Myrtle, staring at him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Nothing,\" said Harry quickly. \"We wanted to ask -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I wish people would stop talking behind my back!\" said Myrtle, in a voice choked with tears. \"I do have feelings, you know, even if I am dead -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Myrtle, no one wants to upset you,\" said Hermione. \"Harry only -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No one wants to upset me! That's a good one!\" howled Myrtle. \"My life was nothing but misery at this place and now people come along ruining my death!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We wanted to ask you if you've seen anything funny lately,\" said Hermione quickly. \"Because a cat was attacked right outside your front door on Halloween.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Did you see anyone near here that night?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"I wasn't paying attention,\" said Myrtle dramatically. \"Peeves upset me so much I came in here and tried to kill myself Then, of course, I remembered that I'm - that I'm \"\n\u3000\u3000\"Already dead,\" said Ron helpfully.\n\u3000\u3000* IL 56*\n\u3000\u3000Myrtle gave a tragic sob, rose up in the air, turned over, and dived headfirst into the toilet, splashing water all over them and vanishing from sight, although from the direction of her muffled sobs, she had come to rest somewhere in the U-bend.\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron stood with their mouths open, but Hermione shrugged wearily and said, \"Honestly, that was almost cheerful for Myrtle .... Come on, let's go.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry had barely closed the door on Myrtle's gurgling sobs when a loud voice made all three of them jump.\n\u3000\u3000\"RON!\"\n\u3000\u3000Percy Weasley had stopped dead at the head of the stairs, prefect badge agleam, an expression of complete shock on his face.\n\u3000\u3000\"That's a girls' bathroom!\" he gasped. \"What were you -?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Just having a look around,\" Ron shrugged. \"Clues, you know -\"\n\u3000\u3000Percy swelled in a manner that reminded Harry forcefully of Mrs. Weasley.\n\u3000\u3000\"Get - away - from - there -\" Perry said, striding toward them and starting to bustle them along, flapping his arms. \"Don't you care what this looks like? Coming back here while everyone's at dinner -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Why shouldn't we be here?\" said Ron hotly, stopping short and glaring at Percy. \"Listen, we never laid a finger on that cat!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That's what I told Ginny,\" said Percy fiercely, \"but she still seems to think you're going to be expelled, I've never seen her so upset, crying her eyes out, you might think of her, all the first years are thoroughly overexcited by this business -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You don't care about Ginny,\" said Ron, whose ears were now\n\u3000\u3000*157*\n\u3000\u3000reddening. \"You're just worried I'm going to mess up your chances of being Head Boy -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Five points from Gryffindor!\" Percy said tersely, fingering his prefect badge. \"And I hope it teaches you a lesson! No more detective work, or I'll write to Mum!\"\n\u3000\u3000And he strode off, the back of his neck as red as Ron's ears.\n\u3000\u3000Harry, Ron, and Hermione chose seats as far as possible from Percy in the common room that night. Ron was still in a very bad temper and kept blotting his Charms homework. When he reached absently for his wand to remove the smudges, it ignited the parchment. Fuming almost as much as his homework, Ron slammed The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2 shut. To Harry's surprise, Hermione followed suit.\n\u3000\u3000\"Who can it be, though?\" she said in a quiet voice, as though continuing a conversation they had just been having. \"Who'd want to frighten all the Squibs and Muggle-borns out of Hogwarts?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Let's think,\" said Ron in mock puzzlement. \"Who do we know who thinks Muggle-borns are scum?\"\n\u3000\u3000He looked at Hermione. Hermione looked back, unconvinced.\n\u3000\u3000\"If you're talking about Malfoy -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Of course I am!\" said Ron. \"You heard him - `You'll be next, Mudbloods!'- come on, you've only got to look at his foul rat face to know it's him -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?\" said Hermione skeptically.\n\u3000\u3000\"Look at his family,\" said Harry, closing his books, too. \"The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin; he's always boasting about it. They could easily be Slytherin's descendants. His father's definitely evil enough.\"\n\u3000\u3000*158*\n\u3000\u3000\"They couldve had the key to the Chamber of Secrets for centuries!\" said Ron. \"Handing it down, father to son ......\n\u3000\u3000\"Well,\" said Hermione cautiously, \"I suppose it's possible ......\n\u3000\u3000\"But how do we prove it?\" said Harry darkly.\n\u3000\u3000\"There might be a way,\" said Hermione slowly, dropping her voice still further with a quick glance across the room at Percy. \"Of course, it would be difficult. And dangerous, very dangerous. We'd be breaking about fifty school rules, I expect -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"If, in a month or so, you feel like explaining, you will let us know, won't you?\" said Ron irritably.\n\u3000\u3000\"All right,\" said Hermione coldly. \"What we'd need to do is to get inside the Slytherin common room and ask Malfoy a few questions without him realizing it's us.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But that's impossible,\" Harry said as Ron laughed.\n\u3000\u3000\"No, it's not,\" said Hermione. \"All we'd need would be some Polyjuice Potion.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What's that?\" said Ron and Harry together.\n\u3000\u3000\"Snape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"D'you think we've got nothing better to do in Potions than listen to Snape?\" muttered Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"It transforms you into somebody else. Think about it! We could change into three of the Slytherins. No one would know it was us. Malfoy would probably tell us anything. He's probably boasting about it in the Slytherin common room right now, if only we could hear him.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"This Polyjuice stuff sounds a bit dodgy to me,\" said Ron, frowning. \"What if we were stuck looking like three of the Slytherins forever?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It wears off after a while,\" said Hermione, waving her hand\n\u3000\u3000*159*\n\u3000\u3000impatiently. \"But getting hold of the recipe will be very difficult. Snape said it was in a book called Moste Potente Potions and it's bound to be in the Restricted Section of the library.\" There was only one way to get out a book from the Restricted Section: You needed a signed note of permission from a teacher. \"Hard to see why we'd want the book, really,\" said Ron, \"if we weren't going to try and make one of the potions.\" \"I think,\" said Hermione, \"that if we made it sound as though we were just interested in the theory, we might stand a chance ...... \"Oh, come on, no teacher's going to fall for that,\" said Ron. \"They'd have to be really thick . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER TEN\n\u3000\u3000THE ROGUE BLUDGER\n\u3000\u3000ince the disastrous episode of the pixies, Professor Lockhart had not brought live creatures to class. Instead, he read passages from his books to them, and sometimes reenacted some of the more dramatic bits. He usually picked Harry to help him with these reconstructions; so far, Harry had been forced to play a simple Transylvanian villager whom Lockhart had cured of a Babbling Curse, a yeti with a head cold, and a vampire who had been unable to eat anything except lettuce since Lockhart had dealt with him.\n\u3000\u3000Harry was hauled to the front of the class during their very next Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson, this time acting a werewolf If he hadn't had a very good reason for keeping Lockhart in a good mood, he would have refused to do it.\n\u3000\u3000\"Nice loud howl, Harry - exactly - and then, if you'll believe it, I pounced - like this - slammed him to the floor - thus with one hand, I managed to hold him down - with my other, I\n\u3000\u3000*161*\n\u3000\u3000put my wand to his throat -I then screwed up my remaining strength and performed the immensely complex Homorphus Charm - he let out a piteous moan - go on, Harry - higher than that - good - the fur vanished - the fangs shrank - and he turned back into a man. Simple, yet effective - and another village will remember me forever as the hero who delivered them from the monthly terror of werewolf attacks.\"\n\u3000\u3000The bell rang and Lockhart got to his feet.\n\u3000\u3000\"Homework - compose a poem about my defeat of the Wagga Wagga Werewolf! Signed copies of Magical Me to the author of the best one!\"\n\u3000\u3000The class began to leave. Harry returned to the back of the room, where Ron and Hermione were waiting.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ready?\" Harry muttered.\n\u3000\u3000\"Wait till everyone's gone,\" said Hermione nervously. \"All right . . . \"\n\u3000\u3000She approached Lockhart's desk, a piece of paper clutched tightly in her hand, Harry and Ron right behind her.\n\u3000\u3000\"Er - Professor Lockhart?\" Hermione stammered. \"I wanted to - to get this book out of the library. Just for background reading.\" She held out the piece of paper, her hand shaking slightly. \"But the thing is, it's in the Restricted Section of the library, so I need a teacher to sign for it - I'm sure it would help me understand what you say in Gadding with Ghouls about slow-acting venoms\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah, Gadding with Ghouls!\" said Lockhart, taking the note from Hermione and smiling widely at her. \"Possibly my very favorite book. You enjoyed it?\"\n\u3000\u3000-162\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, yes,\" said Hermione eagerly. \"So clever, the way you trapped that last one with the tea-strainer -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, I'm sure no one will mind me giving the best student of the year a little extra help,\" said Lockhart warmly, and he pulled out an enormous peacock quill. \"Yes, nice, isn't it?\" he said, misreading the revolted look on Ron's face. \"I usually save it for book-signings.\"\n\u3000\u3000He scrawled an enormous loopy signature on the note and handed it back to Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"So, Harry,\" said Lockhart, while Hermione folded the note with fumbling fingers and slipped it into her bag. \"Tomorrow's the first Quidditch match of the season, I believe? Gryffindor against Slytherin, is it not? I hear you're a useful player. I was a Seeker, too. I was asked to try for the National Squad, but preferred to dedicate my life to the eradication of the Dark Forces. Still, if ever you feel the need for a little private training, don't hesitate to ask. Always happy to pass on my expertise to less able players ......\n\u3000\u3000Harry made an indistinct noise in his throat and then hurried off after Ron and Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't believe it,\" he said as the three of them examined the signature on the note. \"He didn't even look at the book we wanted.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That's because he's a brainless git,\" said Ron. \"But who cares, we've got what we needed -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He is not a brainless git,\" said Hermione shrilly as they half ran toward the library.\n\u3000\u3000\"Just because he said you were the best student of the year -\"\n\u3000\u3000They dropped their voices as they entered the muffled stillness of the library. Madam Pince, the librarian, was a thin, irritable woman who looked like an underfed vulture.\n\u3000\u3000*163*\n\u3000\u3000\"Moste Potente Potions?\" she repeated suspiciously, trying to take the note from Hermione; but Hermione wouldn't let go.\n\u3000\u3000\"I was wondering if I could keep it,\" she said breathlessly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, come on,\" said Ron, wrenching it from her grasp and thrusting it at Madam Pince. \"We'll get you another autograph. Lockhart'll sign anything if it stands still long enough.\"\n\u3000\u3000Madam Pince held the note up to the light, as though determined to detect a forgery, but it passed the test. She stalked away between the lofty shelves and returned several minutes later carrying a large and moldy-looking book. Hermione put it carefully into her bag and they left, trying not to walk too quickly or look too guilty.\n\u3000\u3000Five minutes later, they were barricaded in Moaning Myrtle's out-of- order bathroom once again. Hermione had overridden Ron's objections by pointing out that it was the last place anyone in their right minds would go, so they were guaranteed some privacy. Moaning Myrtle was crying noisily in her stall, but they were ignoring her, and she them.\n\u3000\u3000Hermione opened Moste Potente Potions carefully, and the three of them bent over the damp-spotted pages. It was clear from a glance why it belonged in the Restricted Section. Some of the potions had effects almost too gruesome to think about, and there were some very unpleasant illustrations, which included a man who seemed to have been turned inside out and a witch sprouting several extra pairs of arms out of her head.\n\u3000\u3000\"Here it is,\" said Hermione excitedly as she found the page headed The Polyjuice Potion. It was decorated with drawings of people halfway through transforming into other people. Harry sin\n\u3000\u3000*164*\n\u3000\u3000cerely hoped the artist had imagined the looks of intense pain on their faces.\n\u3000\u3000\"This is the most complicated potion I've ever seen,\" said Hermione as they scanned the recipe. \"Lacewing flies, leeches, fluxweed, and knotgrass,\" she murmured, running her finger down the list of ingredients. \"Well, they're easy enough, they're in the student store- cupboard, we can help ourselves .... Oooh, look, powdered horn of a bicorn - don't know where we're going to get that - shredded skin of a boomslang -. that'll be tricky, too and of course a bit of whoever we want to change into.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Excuse me?\" said Ron sharply. \"What d'you mean, a bit of whoever we're changing into? I'm drinking nothing with Crabbe's toenails in it -\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione continued as though she hadn't heard him.\n\u3000\u3000\"We don't have to worry about that yet, though, because we add those bits last ......\n\u3000\u3000Ron turned, speechless, to Harry, who had another worry.\n\u3000\u3000\"D'you realize how much we're going to have to steal, Hermione? Shredded skin of a boomslang, that's definitely not in the students' cupboard. What're we going to do, break into Snape's private stores? I don't know if this is a good idea ......\n\u3000\u3000Hermione shut the book with a snap.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, if you two are going to chicken out, fine,\" she said. There were bright pink patches on her cheeks and her eyes were brighter than usual. \"I don't want to break rules, you know. I think threatening Muggle-borns is far worse than brewing up a difficult potion. But if you don't want to find out if it's Malfoy, I'll go straight to Madam Pince now and hand the book back in ='\n\u3000\u3000*165\n\u3000\u3000\"I never thought Id see the day when you'd be persuading us to break rules,\" said Ron. \"All right, we'll do it. But not toenails, okay?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"How long will it take to make, anyway?\" said Harry as Hermione, looking happier, opened the book again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, since the fluxweed has got to be picked at the full moon and the lacewings have got to be stewed for twenty-one days ... I'd say it'd be ready in about a month, if we can get all the ingredients.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"A month?\" said Ron. \"Malfoy could have attacked half the Muggle- borns in the school by then!\" But Hermione's eyes narrowed dangerously again, and he added swiftly, \"But it's the best plan we've got, so full steam ahead, I say.\"\n\u3000\u3000However, while Hermione was checking that the coast was clear for them to leave the bathroom, Ron muttered to Harry, \"It'll be a lot less hassle if you can just knock Malfoy off his broom tomorrow.\n\u3000\u3000Harry woke early on Saturday morning and lay for a while thinking about the coming Quidditch match. He was nervous, mainly at the thought of what Wood would say if Gryffindor lost, but also at the idea of facing a team mounted on the fastest racing brooms gold could buy. He had never wanted to beat Slytherin so badly. After half an hour of lying there with his insides churning, he got up, dressed, and went down to breakfast early, where he found the rest of the Gryffindor team huddled at the long, empty table, all looking uptight and not speaking much.\n\u3000\u3000As eleven o'clock approached, the whole school started to make its way down to the Quidditch stadium. It was a muggy sort of day\n\u3000\u3000*166*\n\u3000\u3000with a hint of thunder in the air. Ron and Hermione came hurrying over to wish Harry good luck as he entered the locker rooms. The team pulled on their scarlet Gryffindor robes, then sat down to listen to Wood's usual pre-match pep talk.\n\u3000\u3000\"Slytherin has better brooms than us,\" he began. \"No point denying it. But we've got better people on our brooms. We've trained harder than they have, we've been flying in all weathers -\" (\"Too true,\" muttered George Weasley. \"I haven't been properly dry since August\") \"- and we're going to make them rue the day they let that little bit of slime, Malfoy, buy his way onto their team.\"\n\u3000\u3000Chest heaving with emotion, Wood turned to Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"It'll be down to you, Harry, to show them that a Seeker has to have something more than a rich father. Get to that Snitch before Malfoy or die trying, Harry, because we've got to win today, we've got to.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"So no pressure, Harry\" said Fred, winking at him.\n\u3000\u3000As they walked out onto the pitch, a roar of noise greeted them; mainly cheers, because Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were anxious to see Slytherin beaten, but the Slytherins in the crowd made their boos and hisses heard, too. Madam Hooch, the Quidditch teacher, asked Flint and Wood to shake hands, which they did, giving each other threatening stares and gripping rather harder than was necessary.\n\u3000\u3000\"On my whistle,\" said Madam Hooch. \"Three ... two ... one. . .\n\u3000\u3000With a roar from the crowd to speed them upward, the fourteen players rose toward the leaden sky. Harry flew higher than any of them, squinting around for the Snitch.\n\u3000\u3000*167*\n\u3000\u3000\"All right there, Scarhead?\" yelled Malfoy, shooting underneath him as though to show off the speed of his broom.\n\u3000\u3000Harry had no time to reply. At that very moment, a heavy black Bludger came pelting toward him; he avoided it so narrowly that he felt it ruffle his hair as it passed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Close one, Harry!\" said George, streaking past him with his club in his hand, ready to knock the Bludger back toward a Slytherin. Harry saw George give the Bludger a powerful whack in the direction of Adrian Pucey, but the Bludger changed direction in midair and shot straight for Harry again.\n\u3000\u3000Harry dropped quickly to avoid it, and George managed to hit it hard toward Malfoy. Once again, the Bludger swerved like a boomerang and shot at Harry's head.\n\u3000\u3000Harry put on a burst of speed and zoomed toward the other end of the pitch. He could hear the Bludger whistling along behind him. What was going on? Bludgers never concentrated on one player like this; it was their job to try and unseat as many people as possible ....\n\u3000\u3000Fred Weasley was waiting for the Bludger at the other end. Harry ducked as Fred swung at the Bludger with all his might; the Bludger was knocked off course.\n\u3000\u3000\"Gotcha!\" Fred yelled happily, but he was wrong; as though it was magnetically attracted to Harry, the Bludger pelted after him once more and Harry was forced to fly off at full speed.\n\u3000\u3000It had started to rain; Harry felt heavy drops fall onto his face, splattering onto his glasses. He didn't have a clue what was going on in the rest of the game until he heard Lee Jordan, who was commentating, say, \"Slytherin lead, sixty points to zero ='\n\u3000\u3000*168*\n\u3000\u3000The Slytherins' superior brooms were clearly doing their jobs, and meanwhile the mad Bludger was doing all it could to knock Harry out of the air. Fred and George were now flying so close to him on either side that Harry could see nothing at all except their flailing arms and had no chance to look for the Snitch, let alone catch it.\n\u3000\u3000\"Someone's - tampered - with - this - Bludger -\" Fred grunted, swinging his bat with all his might at it as it launched a new attack on Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"We need time out,\" said George, trying to signal to Wood and stop the Bludger breaking Harry's nose at the same time.\n\u3000\u3000Wood had obviously got the message. Madam Hooch's whistle rang out and Harry, Fred, and George dived for the ground, still trying to avoid the mad Bludger.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's going on?\" said Wood as the Gryffindor team huddled together, while Slytherins in the crowd jeered. \"We're being flattened. Fred, George, where were you when that Bludger stopped Angelina scoring?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We were twenty feet above her, stopping the other Bludger from murdering Harry, Oliver,\" said George angrily. \"Someone's fixed it - it won't leave Harry alone. It hasn't gone for anyone else all game. The Slytherins must have done something to it.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But the Bludgers have been locked in Madam Hooch's office since our last practice, and there was nothing wrong with them then . . . . \" said Wood, anxiously.\n\u3000\u3000Madam Hooch was walking toward them. Over her shoulder, Harry could see the Slytherin team jeering and pointing in his direction.\n\u3000\u3000169\n\u3000\u3000\"Listen,\" said Harry as she came nearer and nearer, \"with you two flying around me all the time the only way I'm going to catch the Snitch is if it flies up my sleeve. Go back to the rest of the team and let me deal with the rogue one.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't be thick,\" said Fred. \"It'll take your head off.\"\n\u3000\u3000Wood was looking from Harry to the Weasleys.\n\u3000\u3000(I Oliver, this is insane,\" said Alicia Spinner angrily. \"You can't let Harry deal with that thing on his own. Let's ask for an inquiry -))\n\u3000\u3000\"If we stop now, we'll have to forfeit the match!\" said Harry. \"And we're not losing to Slytherin just because of a crazy Bludger! Come on, Oliver, tell them to leave me alone!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"This is all your fault,\" George said angrily to Wood. \" `Get the Snitch or die trying,' what a stupid thing to tell him -\"\n\u3000\u3000Madam Hooch had joined them.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ready to resume play?\" she asked Wood.\n\u3000\u3000Wood looked at the determined look on Harry's face.\n\u3000\u3000\"All right,\" he said. \"Fred, George, you heard Harry -leave him alone and let him deal with the Bludger on his own.\"\n\u3000\u3000The rain was falling more heavily now. On Madam Hooch's whistle, Harry kicked hard into the air and heard the telltale whoosh of the Bludger behind him. Higher and higher Harry climbed; he looped and swooped, spiraled, zigzagged, and rolled. Slightly dizzy, he nevertheless kept his eyes wide open, rain was speckling his glasses and ran up his nostrils as he hung upside down, avoiding another fierce dive from the Bludger. He could hear laughter from the crowd; he knew he must look very stupid, but the rogue Bludger was heavy and couldn't change direction as quickly as Harry could; he began a kind of roller-coaster ride around the\n\u3000\u3000*170*\n\u3000\u3000edges of the stadium, squinting through the silver sheets of rain to the Gryffindor goal posts, where Adrian Pucey was trying to get past Wood\n\u3000\u3000A whistling in Harry's ear told him the Bludger had just missed him again; he turned right over and sped in the opposite direction.\n\u3000\u3000\"Training for the ballet, Potter?\" yelled Malfoy as Harry was forced to do a stupid kind of twirl in midair to dodge the Bludger, and he fled, the Bludger trailing a few feet behind him; and then, glaring back at Malfoy in hatred, he saw it - the Golden Snitch. It was hovering inches above Malfoy's left ear - and Malfoy, busy laughing at Harry, hadn't seen it.\n\u3000\u3000For an agonizing moment, Harry hung in midair, not daring to speed toward Malfoy in case he looked up and saw the Snitch.\n\u3000\u3000WHAM.\n\u3000\u3000He had stayed still a second too long. The Bludger had hit him at last, smashed into his elbow, and Harry felt his arm break. Dimly, dazed by the searing pain in his arm, he slid sideways on his rain-drenched broom, one knee still crooked over it, his right arm dangling useless at his side - the Bludger came pelting back for a second attack, this time W-ming at his face - Harry swerved out of the way, one idea firmly lodged in his numb brain: get to Malfoy.\n\u3000\u3000Through a haze of rain and pain he dived for the shimmering, sneering face below him and saw its eyes widen with fear: Malfoy thought Harry was attacking him.\n\u3000\u3000\"What the -\" he gasped, careening out of Harry's way.\n\u3000\u3000Harry took his remaining hand off his broom and made a wild snatch; he felt his fingers close on the cold Snitch but was now only\n\u3000\u3000*171*\n\u3000\u3000gripping the broom with his legs, and there was a yell from the crowd below as he headed straight for the ground, trying hard not to pass out.\n\u3000\u3000With a splattering thud he hit the mud and rolled off his broom. His arm was hanging at a very strange angle; riddled with pain, he heard, as though from a distance, a good deal of whistling and shouting. He focused on the Snitch clutched in his good hand.\n\u3000\u3000\"Aha,\" he said vaguely. \"We've won.\"\n\u3000\u3000And he fainted.\n\u3000\u3000He came around, rain falling on his face, still lying on the field, with someone leaning over him. He saw a glitter of teeth.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, no, not you,\" he moaned.\n\u3000\u3000\"Doesn't know what he's saying,\" said Lockhart loudly to the anxious crowd of Gryffindors pressing around them. \"Not to worry, Harry. I'm about to fix your arm.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No!\"said Harry. \"I'll keep it like this, thanks ......\n\u3000\u3000He tried to sit up, but the pain was terrible. He heard a familiar clicking noise nearby.\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't want a photo of this, Colin,\" he said loudly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Lie back, Harry,\" said Lockhart soothingly. \"It's a simple charm I've used countless times -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Why can't I just go to the hospital wing?\" said Harry through clenched teeth.\n\u3000\u3000\"He should really, Professor,\" said a muddy Wood, who couldn't help grinning even though his Seeker was injured. \"Great capture, Harry, really spectacular, your best yet, Id say -\"\n\u3000\u3000Through the thicket of legs around him, Harry spotted Fred and\n\u3000\u3000*112*\n\u3000\u3000George Weasley, wrestling the rogue Bludger into a box. It was still putting up a terrific fight.\n\u3000\u3000\"Stand back,\" said Lockhart, who was rolling up his jade-green sleeves.\n\u3000\u3000\"No - don't -\" said Harry weakly, but Lockhart was twirling his wand and a second later had directed it straight at Harry's arm.\n\u3000\u3000A strange and unpleasant sensation started at Harry's shoulder and spread all the way down to his fingertips. It felt as though his arm was being deflated. He didn't dare look at what was happening. He had shut his eyes, his face turned away from his arm, but his worst fears were realized as the people above him gasped and Colin Creevey began clicking away madly. His arm didn't hurt anymore - nor did it feel remotely like an arm.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah,\" said Lockhart. \"Yes. Well, that can sometimes happen. But the point is, the bones are no longer broken. That's the thing to bear in mind. So, Harry, just toddle up to the hospital wing - ah, Mr. Weasley, Miss Granger, would you escort him? - and Madam Pomfrey will be able to - er - tidy you up a bit.\"\n\u3000\u3000As Harry got to his feet, he felt strangely lopsided. Taking a deep breath he looked down at his right side. What he saw nearly made him pass out again.\n\u3000\u3000Poking out of the end of his robes was what looked like a thick, flesh- colored rubber glove. He tried to move his fingers. Nothing happened.\n\u3000\u3000Lockhart hadn't mended Harry's bones. He had removed them.\n\u3000\u3000Madam Pomfrey wasn't at all pleased.\n\u3000\u3000\"You should have come straight to me!\" she raged, holding up\n\u3000\u3000*173*\n\u3000\u3000the sad, limp remainder of what, half an hour before, had been a working arm. \"I can mend bones in a second - but growing them back - \"\n\u3000\u3000\"You will be able to, won't you?\" said Harry desperately.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll be able to, certainly, but it will be painful,\" said Madam Pomfrey grimly, throwing Harry a pair of pajamas. \"You'll have to stay the night ......\n\u3000\u3000Hermione waited outside the curtain drawn around Harry's bed while Ron helped him into his pajamas. It took a while to stuff the rubbery, boneless arm into a sleeve.\n\u3000\u3000\"How can you stick up for Lockhart now, Hermione, eh?\" Ron called through the curtain as he pulled Harry's limp fingers through the cuff. \"If Harry had wanted deboning he would have asked.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Anyone can make a mistake,\" said Hermione. \"And it doesn't hurt anymore, does it, Harry?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Harry, getting into bed. \"But it doesn't do anything else either.\"\n\u3000\u3000As he swung himself onto the bed, his arm flapped pointlessly.\n\u3000\u3000Hermione and Madam Pomfrey came around the curtain. Madam Pomfrey was holding a large bottle of something labeled Skele-Gro.\n\u3000\u3000\"You're in for a rough night,\" she said, pouring out a steaming beakerful and handing it to him. \"Regrowing bones is a nasty business.\n\u3000\u3000So was taking the Skele-Gro. It burned Harry's mouth and throat as it went down, making him cough and splutter. Still tut-tutting about dangerous sports and inept teachers, Madam Pomfrey re\n\u3000\u3000*114*\n\u3000\u3000treated, leaving Ron and Hermione to help Harry gulp down some water. \"We won, though,\" said Ron, a grin breaking across his face. \"That was some catch you made. Malfoy's face ... he looked ready to kill ...... \"I want to know how he fixed that Bludger,\" said Hermione darkly. \"We can add that to the list of questions we'll ask him when we've taken the Polyjuice Potion,\" said Harry, sinking back onto his pillows. \"I hope it tastes better than this stuff .....\n\u3000\u3000\"If it's got bits of Slytherins in it? You've got to be joking,\" said Ron. The door of the hospital wing burst open at that moment. Filthy and soaking wet, the rest of the Gryffindor team had arrived to see Harry. \"Unbelievable flying, Harry,\" said George. \"I've just seen Mar cus Flint yelling at Malfoy. Something about having the Snitch on top of his head and not noticing. Malfoy didn't seem too happy.\" They had brought cakes, sweets, and bottles of pumpkin juice; they gathered around Harry's bed and were just getting started on what promised to be a good party when Madam Pomfrey came storming over, shouting, \"This boy needs rest, he's got thirty-three bones to regrow! Out! OUT!\" And Harry was left alone, with nothing to distract him from the stabbing pains in his limp arm.\n\u3000\u3000Hours and hours later, Harry woke quite suddenly in the pitch blackness and gave a small yelp of pain: His arm now felt full of\n\u3000\u3000large splinters. For a second, he thought that was what had woken him. Then, with a thrill of horror, he realized that someone was sponging his forehead in the dark.\n\u3000\u3000\"Get off!\" he said loudly, and then, \"Dobby!\"\n\u3000\u3000The house-elf's goggling tennis ball eyes were peering at Harry through the darkness. A single tear was running down his long, pointed nose.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry Potter came back to school,\" he whispered miserably. \"Dobby warned and warned Harry Potter. Ah sir, why didn't you heed Dobby? Why didn't Harry Potter go back home when he missed the train?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry heaved himself up on his pillows and pushed Dobby's sponge away.\n\u3000\u3000\"What're you doing here?\" he said. \"And how did you know I missed the train?\"\n\u3000\u3000Dobby's lip trembled and Harry was seized by a sudden suspicion.\n\u3000\u3000\"It was you!\" he said slowly. \"You stopped the barrier from letting us through!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Indeed yes, sir,\" said Dobby, nodding his head vigorously, ears flapping. \"Dobby hid and watched for Harry Potter and sealed the gateway and Dobby had to iron his hands afterward\" - he showed Harry ten long, bandaged fingers - \"but Dobby didn't care, sir, for he thought Harry Potter was safe, and never did Dobby dream that Harry Potter would get to school another way!\"\n\u3000\u3000He was rocking backward and forward, shaking his ugly head.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dobby was 'so shocked when he heard Harry Potter was back at Hogwarts, he let his master's dinner burn! Such a flogging Dobby never had, sir . .....\n\u3000\u3000*176*\n\u3000\u3000Harry slumped back onto his pillows.\n\u3000\u3000\"You nearly got Ron and me expelled,\" he said fiercely. \"You'd better get lost before my bones come back, Dobby, or I might strangle you.\"\n\u3000\u3000Dobby smiled weakly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dobby is used to death threats, sir. Dobby gets them five times a day at home.\"\n\u3000\u3000He blew his nose on a corner of the filthy pillowcase he wore, looking so pathetic that Harry felt his anger ebb away in spite of himself.\n\u3000\u3000\"Why d'you wear that thing, Dobby?\" he asked curiously.\n\u3000\u3000\"This, sir?\" said Dobby, plucking at the pillowcase. \"'Tis a mark of the house-elf's enslavement, sir. Dobby can only be freed if his masters present him with clothes, sir. The family is careful not to pass Dobby even a sock, sir, for then he would be free to leave their house forever.\"\n\u3000\u3000Dobby mopped his bulging eyes and said suddenly, \"Harry Potter must go home! Dobby thought his Bludger would be enough to make -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Your Bludger?\" said Harry, anger rising once more. \"What d'you mean, your Bludger? You made that Bludger try and kill me?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Not kill you, sir, never kill you!\" said Dobby, shocked. \"Dobby wants to save Harry Potter's life! Better sent home, grievously injured, than remain here sir! Dobby only wanted Harry Potter hurt enough to be sent home!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, is that all?\" said Harry angrily. \"I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you wanted me sent home in pieces?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah, if Harry Potter only knew!\" Dobby groaned, more tears dripping onto his ragged pillowcase. \"If he knew what he means\n\u3000\u3000 *177*\n\u3000\u3000to us, to the lowly, the enslaved, we dregs of the magical world! Dobby remembers how it was when He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was at the height of his powers, sir! We house-elfs were treated like vermin, sir! Of course, Dobby is still treated like that, sir,\" he admitted, drying his face on the pillowcase. \"But mostly, sir, life has improved for my kind since you triumphed over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Harry Potter survived, and the Dark Lord's power was broken, and it was a new dawn, sir, and Harry Potter shone like a beacon of hope for those of us who thought the Dark days would never end, sit... And now, at Hogwarts, terrible things are to happen, are perhaps happening already, and Dobby cannot let Harry Potter stay here now that history is to repeat itself, now that the Chamber of Secrets is open once more\n\u3000\u3000Dobby froze, horrorstruck, then grabbed Harry's water jug from his bedside table and cracked it over his own head, toppling out of sight. A second later, he crawled back onto the bed, cross-eyed, muttering, \"Bad Dobby, very bad Dobby. . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"So there is a Chamber of Secrets?\" Harry whispered. \"And did you say it's been opened before? Tell me, Dobby!\"\n\u3000\u3000He seized the elf's bony wrist as Dobby's hand inched toward the water jug. \"But I'm not Muggle-born - how can I be in danger from the Chamber?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah, sir, ask no more, ask no more of poor Dobby,\" stammered the elf, his eyes huge in the dark. \"Dark deeds are planned in this place, but Harry Potter must not be here when they happen - go home, Harry Potter, go home. Harry Potter must not meddle in this, sir, 'tis too dangerous -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Who is it, Dobby?\" Harry said, keeping a firm hold on Dobby's\n\u3000\u3000*178*\n\u3000\u3000wrist to stop him from hitting himself with the water jug again. \"Who's opened it? Who opened it last time?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Dobby can't, sir, Dobby can't, Dobby mustn't tell!\" squealed the elf. \"Go home, Harry Potter, go home!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm not going anywhere!\" said Harry fiercely. \"One of my best friends is Muggle-born; she'll be first in line if the Chamber really has been opened -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry Potter risks his own life for his friends!\" moaned Dobby in a kind of miserable ecstasy. \"So noble! So valiant! But he must save himself, he must, Harry Potter must not -\"\n\u3000\u3000Dobby suddenly froze, his bat ears quivering. Harry heard it, too. There were footsteps coming down the passageway outside.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dobby must go!\" breathed the elf, terrified. There was a loud crack, and Harry's fist was suddenly clenched on thin air. He slumped back into bed, his eyes on the dark doorway to the hospital wing as the footsteps drew nearer.\n\u3000\u3000Next moment, Dumbledore was backing into the dormitory, wearing a long woolly dressing gown and a nightcap. He was carrying one end of what looked like a statue. Professor McGonagall appeared a second later, carrying its feet. Together, they heaved it onto a bed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Get Madam Pomfrey,\" whispered Dumbledore, and Professor McGonagall hurried past the end of Harry's bed out of sight. Harry lay quite still, pretending to be asleep. He heard urgent voices, and then Professor McGonagall swept back into view, closely followed by Madam Pomfrey, who was pulling a cardigan on over her nightdress. He heard a sharp intake of breath.\n\u3000\u3000\"What happened?\" Madam Pomfrey whispered to Dumbledore, bending over the statue on the bed.\n\u3000\u3000*l79*\n\u3000\u3000\"Another attack,\" said Dumbledore. \"Minerva found him on the stairs.\n\u3000\u3000\"There was a bunch of grapes next to him,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"We think he was trying to sneak up here to visit Potter.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry's stomach gave a horrible lurch. Slowly and carefully, he raised himself a few inches so he could look at the statue on the bed. A ray of moonlight lay across its staring face.\n\u3000\u3000It was Colin Creevey. His eyes were wide and his hands were stuck up in front of him, holding his camera.\n\u3000\u3000\"Petrified?\" whispered Madam Pomfrey.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"But I shudder to think ... If Albus hadn't been on the way downstairs for hot chocolate - who knows what might have -\"\n\u3000\u3000The three of them stared down at Colin. Then Dumbledore leaned forward and wrenched the camera out of Colin's rigid grip.\n\u3000\u3000\"You don't think he managed to get a picture of his attacker?\" said Professor McGonagall eagerly.\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore didn't answer. He opened the back of the camera.\n\u3000\u3000\"Good gracious!\" said Madam Pomfrey.\n\u3000\u3000A jet of steam had hissed out of the camera. Harry, three beds away, caught the acrid smell of burnt plastic.\n\u3000\u3000\"Melted,\" said Madam Pomfrey wonderingly. \"All melted...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What does this mean, Albus?\" Professor McGonagall asked urgently.\n\u3000\u3000\"It means,\" said Dumbledore, \"that the Chamber of Secrets is indeed open again.\"\n\u3000\u3000Madam Pomfrey clapped a hand to her mouth. Professor McGonagall stared at Dumbledore.\n\u3000\u3000*180*\n\u3000\u3000\"But, Albus ... surely ... who?\" \"The question is not who,\" said Dumbledore, his eyes on Colin. \"The question is, how . . . .\" And from what Harry could see of Professor McGonagall's shad owy face, she didn't understand this any better than he did.\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER ELEVEN\n\u3000\u3000THE D-KJEL]ING C-L-IJIB\n\u3000\u3000Harry woke up on Sunday morning to find the dormitory blazing with winter sunlight and his arm reboned but very stiff. He sat up quickly and looked over at Colin's bed, but it had been blocked from view by the high curtains Harry had changed behind yesterday. Seeing that he was awake, Madam Pomfrey came bustling over with a breakfast tray and then began bending and stretching his arm and fingers.\n\u3000\u3000\"All in order,\" she said as he clumsily fed himself porridge lefthanded. \"When you've finished eating, you may leave.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry dressed as quickly as he could and hurried off to Gryffindor Tower, desperate to tell Ron and Hermione about Colin and Dobby, but they weren't there. Harry left to look for them, wondering where they could have got to and feeling slightly hurt that they weren't interested in whether he had his bones back or not.\n\u3000\u3000*182*\n\u3000\u3000As Harry passed the library, Percy Weasley strolled out of it, looking in far better spirits than last time they'd met.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, hello, Harry,\" he said. \"Excellent flying yesterday, really excellent. Gryffindor has just taken the lead for the House Cup you earned fifty points!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You haven't seen Ron or Hermione, have you?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"No, I haven't,\" said Percy, his smile fading. \"I hope Ron's not in another girls' toilet .....\n\u3000\u3000Harry forced a laugh, watched Percy walk out of sight, and then headed straight for Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. He couldn't see why Ron and Hermione would be in there again, but after making sure that neither Filch nor any prefects were around, he opened the door and heard their voices coming from a locked stall.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's me,\" he said, closing the door behind him. There was a clunk, a splash, and a gasp from within the stall and he saw Hermione's eye peering through the keyhole.\n\u3000\u3000`Harry!\" she said. \"You gave us such a fright - come in how's your arm?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Fine,\" said Harry, squeezing into the stall. An old cauldron was perched on the toilet, and a crackling from under the rim told Harry they had lit a fire beneath it. Conjuring up portable, waterproof fires was a speciality of Hermione's.\n\u3000\u3000\"We'd've come to meet you, but we decided to get started on the Polyjuice Potion,\" Ron explained as Harry, with difficulty, locked the stall again. \"We've decided this is the safest place to hide it.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry started to tell them about Colin, but Hermione interrupted.\n\u3000\u3000\"We already know - we heard Professor McGonagall telling\n\u3000\u3000Professor Flitwick this morning. That's why we decided we'd better get going -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"The sooner we get a confession out of Malfoy, the better,\" snarled Ron. \"D'you know what I think? He was in such a foul temper after the Quidditch match, he took it out on Colin.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"There's something else,\" said Harry, watching Hermione tearing bundles of knotgrass and throwing them into the potion. \"Dobby came to visit me in the middle of the night.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron and Hermione looked up, amazed. Harry told them everything Dobby had told him - or hadn't told him. Hermione and Ron listened with their mouths open.\n\u3000\u3000\"The Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?\" Hermione said.\n\u3000\u3000\"This settles it,\" said Ron in a triumphant voice. \"Lucius Malfoy must've opened the Chamber when he was at school here and now he's told dear old Draco how to do it. It's obvious. Wish Dobby'd told you what kind of monster's in there, though. I want to know how come nobody's noticed it sneaking around the school.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Maybe it can make itself invisible,\" said Hermione, prodding leeches to the bottom of the cauldron. \"Or maybe it can disguise itself - pretend to be a suit of armor or something - I've read about Chameleon Ghouls -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You read too much, Hermione,\" said Ron, pouring dead lacewings on top of the leeches. He crumpled up the empty lacewing bag and looked at Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"So Dobby stopped us from getting on the train and broke your\n\u3000\u3000arm\t\tHe shook his head. \"You know what, Harry? If he doesn't\n\u3000\u3000stop trying to save your life he's going to kill you.\"\n\u3000\u3000*184*\n\u3000\u3000The news that Colin Creevey had been attacked and was now lying as though dead in the hospital wing had spread through the entire school by Monday morning. The air was suddenly thick with rumor and suspicion. The first years were now moving around the castle in tight-knit groups, as though scared they would be attacked if they ventured forth alone.\n\u3000\u3000Ginny Weasley, who sat next to Colin Creevey in Charms, was distraught, but Harry felt that Fred and George were going the wrong way about cheering her up. They were taking turns covering themselves with fur or boils and jumping out at her from behind statues. They only stopped when Percy, apoplectic with rage, told them he was going to write to Mrs. Weasley and tell her Ginny was having nightmares.\n\u3000\u3000Meanwhile, hidden from the teachers, a roaring trade in talismans, amulets, and other protective devices was sweeping the school. Neville Longbottom bought a large, evil-smelling green onion, a pointed purple crystal, and a rotting newt tail before the other Gryffindor boys pointed out that he was in no danger; he was a pure- blood, and therefore unlikely to be attacked.\n\u3000\u3000\"They went for Filch first,\" Neville said, his round face fearful. \"And everyone knows I'm almost a Squib.\"\n\u3000\u3000In the second week of December Professor McGonagall came around as usual, collecting names of those who would be staying at school for Christmas. Harry, Ron, and Hermione signed her list; they had heard that Malfoy was staying, which struck them as very suspicious. The holidays would be the perfect time to use the Polyjuice Potion and try to worm a confession out of him.\n\u3000\u3000Unfortunately, the potion was only half finished. They still\n\u3000\u3000* 3-85*\n\u3000\u3000needed the bicorn horn and the boomslang skin, and the only place they were going to get them was from Snape's private stores. Harry privately felt he'd rather face Slytherin's legendary monster than let Snape catch him robbing his office.\n\u3000\u3000\"What we need,\" said Hermione briskly as Thursday afternoon's double Potions lesson loomed nearer, \"is a diversion. Then one of us can sneak into Snape's office and take what we need.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron looked at her nervously.\n\u3000\u3000\"I think Id better do the actual stealing,\" Hermione continued in a matter-of-fact tone. \"You two will be expelled if you get into any more trouble, and I've got a clean record. So all you need to do is cause enough mayhem to keep Snape busy for five minutes or so.\n\u3000\u3000Harry smiled feebly. Deliberately causing mayhem in Snape's Potions class was about as safe as poking a sleeping dragon in the eye.\n\u3000\u3000Potions lessons took place in one of the large dungeons. Thursday afternoon's lesson proceeded in the usual way. Twenty cauldrons stood steaming between the wooden desks, on which stood brass scales and jars of ingredients. Snape prowled through the fumes, making waspish remarks about the Gryffindors' work while the Slytherins sniggered appreciatively. Draco Malfoy, who was Snape's favorite student, kept flicking puffer-fish eyes at Ron and Harry, who knew that if they retaliated they would get detention faster than you could say \"Unfair.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry's Swelling Solution was far too runny, but he had his mind on more important things. He was waiting for Hermione's signal, and he hardly listened as Snape paused to sneer at his watery\n\u3000\u3000*186*\n\u3000\u3000potion. When Snape turned and walked off to bully Neville, Hermione caught Harry's eye and nodded.\n\u3000\u3000Harry ducked swiftly down behind his cauldron, pulled one of Fred's Filibuster fireworks out of his pocket, and gave it a quick prod with his wand. The firework began to fizz and sputter. Knowing he had only seconds, Harry straightened up, took aim, and lobbed it into the air; it landed right on target in Goyle's cauldron.\n\u3000\u3000Goyle's potion exploded, showering the whole class. People shrieked as splashes of the Swelling Solution hit them. Malfoy got a faceful and his nose began to swell like a balloon; Goyle blundered around, his hands over his eyes, which had expanded to the size of a dinner plate - Snape was trying to restore calm and find out what had happened. Through the confusion, Harry saw Hermione slip quietly into Snape's office.\n\u3000\u3000\"Silence! SILENCE!\" Snape roared. \"Anyone who has been splashed, come here for a Deflating Draft - when I find out who did this -\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry tried not to laugh as he watched Malfoy hurry forward, his head drooping with the weight of a nose like a small melon. As half the class lumbered up to Snape's desk, some weighted down with arms like clubs, others unable to talk through gigantic puffedup lips, Harry saw Hermione slide back into the dungeon, the front of her robes bulging.\n\u3000\u3000When everyone had taken a swig of antidote and the various swellings had subsided, Snape swept over to Goyle's cauldron and scooped out the twisted black remains of the firework. There was a sudden hush.\n\u3000\u3000*187*\n\u3000\u3000\"If I ever find out who threw this,\" Snape whispered, \"I shall make sure that person is expelled.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry arranged his face into what he hoped was a puzzled expression. Snape was looking right at him, and the bell that rang ten minutes later could not have been more welcome.\n\u3000\u3000\"He knew it was me,\" Harry told Ron and Hermione as they hurried back to Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. \"I could tell.\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione threw the new ingredients into the cauldron and began to stir feverishly.\n\u3000\u3000\"It'll be ready in two weeks,\" she said happily.\n\u3000\u3000\"Snape can't prove it was you,\" said Ron reassuringly to Harry. \"What can he do?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Knowing Snape, something foul,\" said Harry as the potion frothed and bubbled.\n\u3000\u3000A week later, Harry, Ron, and Hermione were walking across the entrance hall when they saw a small knot of people gathered around the notice board, reading a piece of parchment that had just been pinned up. Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas beckoned them over, looking excited.\n\u3000\u3000\"They're starting a Dueling Club!\" said Seamus. \"First meeting tonight! I wouldn't mind dueling lessons; they might come in handy one of these days ......\n\u3000\u3000\"What, you reckon Slytherin's monster can duel?\" said Ron, but he, too, read the sign with interest.\n\u3000\u3000\"Could be useful,\" he said to Harry and Hermione as they went into dinner. \"Shall we go?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Hermione were all for it, so at eight o'clock that\n\u3000\u3000*188*\n\u3000\u3000evening they hurried back to the Great Hall. The long dining tables had vanished and a golden stage had appeared along one wall, lit by thousands of candles floating overhead. The ceiling was velvety black once more and most of the school seemed to be packed beneath it, all carrying their wands and looking excited.\n\u3000\u3000\"I wonder who'll be teaching us?\" said Hermione as they edged into the chattering crowd. \"Someone told me Flitwick was a dueling champion when he was young - maybe it'll be him.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"As long as it's not -\" Harry began, but he ended on a groan: Gilderoy Lockhart was walking onto the stage, resplendent in robes of deep plum and accompanied by none other than Snape, wearing his usual black.\n\u3000\u3000Lockhart waved an arm for silence and called ' \"Gather round, gather round! Can everyone see me? Can you all hear me? Excellent!\n\u3000\u3000\"Now, Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this little dueling club, to train you all in case you ever need to defend yourselves as I myself have done on countless occasions - for full details, see my published works.\n\u3000\u3000\"Let me introduce my assistant, Professor Snape,\" said Lockhart, flashing a wide smile. \"He tells me he knows a tiny little bit about dueling himself and has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration before we begin. Now, I don't want any of you youngsters to worry - you'll still have your Potions master when I'm through with him, never fear!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Wouldn't it be good if they finished each other off?\" Ron muttered in Harry's ear.\n\u3000\u3000Snape's upper lip was curling. Harry wondered why Lockhart\n\u3000\u3000*189*\n\u3000\u3000was still smiling; if Snape had been looking at him like that he'd have been running as fast as he could in the opposite direction.\n\u3000\u3000Lockhart and Snape turned to face each other and bowed; at least, Lockhart did, with much twirling of his hands, whereas Snape jerked his head irritably. Then they raised their wands like swords in front of them.\n\u3000\u3000\"As you see, we are holding our wands in the accepted combative position,\" Lockhart told the silent crowd. \"On the count of three, we will cast our first spells. Neither of us will be aiming to kill, of course.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I wouldn't bet on that,\" Harry murmured, watching Snape baring his teeth.\n\u3000\u3000\"One - two - three -\"\n\u3000\u3000Both of them swung their wands above their heads and pointed them at their opponent; Snape cried: \"Expelliarmus!\" There was a dazzling flash of scarlet light and Lockhart was blasted off his feet: He flew backward off the stage, smashed into the wall, and slid down it to sprawl on the floor.\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy and some of the other Slytherins cheered. Hermione was dancing on tiptoes. \"Do you think he's all right?\" she squealed through her fingers.\n\u3000\u3000\"Who cares?\" said Harry and Ron together.\n\u3000\u3000Lockhart was getting unsteadily to his feet. His hat had fallen off and his wavy hair was standing on end.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, there you have it!\" he said, tottering back onto the platform. \"That was a Disarming Charm - as you see, I've lost my wand - ah, thank you, Miss Brown - yes, an excellent idea to show them that, Professor Snape, but if you don't mind my saying\n\u3000\u3000*190*\n\u3000\u3000so, it was very obvious what you were about to do. If I had wanted to stop you it would have been only too easy - however, I felt it would be instructive to let them see . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000Snape was looking murderous. Possibly Lockhart had noticed, because he said, \"Enough demonstrating! I'm going to come amongst you now and put you all into pairs. Professor Snape, if you'd like to help me -\"\n\u3000\u3000They moved through the crowd, matching up partners. Lockhart teamed Neville with Justin Finch-Fletchley, but Snape reached Harry and Ron first.\n\u3000\u3000\"Time to split up the dream team, I think,\" he sneered. \"Weasley, you can partner Finnigan. Potter -\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry moved automatically toward Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't think so,\" said Snape, smiling coldly. \"Mr. Malfoy, come over here. Let's see what you make of the famous Potter. And you, Miss Granger - you can partner Miss Bulstrode.\"\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy strutted over, smirking. Behind him walked a Slytherin girl who reminded Harry of a picture he'd seen in Holidays with Hags. She was large and square and her heavy jaw jutted aggressively. Hermione gave her a weak smile that she did not return.\n\u3000\u3000\"Face your partners!\" called Lockhart, back on the platform. \"And bow!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Malfoy barely inclined their heads, not taking their eyes off each other.\n\u3000\u3000\"Wands at the ready!\" shouted Lockhart. \"When I count to three, cast your charms to disarm your opponents - only to disarm them - we don't want any accidents - one ... two ... three -\"\n\u3000\u3000*191*\n\u3000\u3000Harry swung his wand high, but Malfoy had already started on \"two\": His spell hit Harry so hard he felt as though he'd been hit over the head with a saucepan. He stumbled, but everything still seemed to be working, and wasting no more time, Harry pointed his wand straight at Malfoy and shouted, \"Rictusempra!\"\n\u3000\u3000A jet of silver light hit Malfoy in the stomach and he doubled up, wheezing.\n\u3000\u3000\"I said disarm only!\" Lockhart shouted in alarm over the heads of the battling crowd, as Malfoy sank to his knees; Harry had hit him with a Tickling Charm, and he could barely move for laughing. Harry hung back, with a vague feeling it would be unsporting to bewitch Malfoy while he was on the floor, but this was a mistake; gasping for breath, Malfoy pointed his wand at Harry's knees, choked, \"Tarantallegra!\" and the next second Harry's legs began to jerk around out of his control in a kind of quickstep.\n\u3000\u3000\"Stop! Stop!\" screamed Lockhart, but Snape took charge.\n\u3000\u3000\"Finite Incantatem!\" he shouted; Harry's feet stopped dancing, Malfoy stopped laughing, and they were able to look up.\n\u3000\u3000A haze of greenish smoke was hovering over the scene. Both Neville and Justin were lying on the floor, panting; Ron was holding up an ashen-faced Seamus, apologizing for whatever his broken wand had done; but Hermione and Millicent Bulstrode were still moving; Millicent had Hermione in a headlock and Hermione was whimpering in pain; both their wands lay forgotten on the floor. Harry leapt forward and pulled Millicent off. It was difficult: She was a lot bigger than he was.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dear, dear,\" said Lockhart, skittering through the crowd, looking at the aftermath of the duels. \"Up you go, Macmillan ....\n\u3000\u3000*192*\n\u3000\u3000Careful there, Miss Fawcett .... Pinch it hard, it'll stop bleeding in a second, Boot\n\u3000\u3000\"I think Id better teach you how to block unfriendly spells,\" said Lockhart, standing flustered in the midst of the hall. He glanced at Snape, whose black eyes glinted, and looked quickly away. \"Let's have a volunteer pair - Longbottom and Finch-Fletchley, how about you -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"A bad idea, Professor Lockhart,\" said Snape, gliding over like a large and malevolent bat. \"Longbottom causes devastation with the simplest spells. We'll be sending what's left of Finch-Fletchley up to the hospital wing in a matchbox.\" Neville's round, pink face went pinker. \"How about Malfoy and Potter?\" said Snape with a twisted smile.\n\u3000\u3000\"Excellent idea!\" said Lockhart, gesturing Harry and Malfoy into the middle of the hall as the crowd backed away to give them room.\n\u3000\u3000\"Now, Harry,\" said Lockhart. \"When Draco points his wand at you, you do this.\"\n\u3000\u3000He raised his own wand, attempted a complicated sort of wiggling action, and dropped it. Snape smirked as Lockhart quickly picked it up, saying, \"Whoops -my wand is a little overexcited -\"\n\u3000\u3000Snape moved closer to Malfoy, bent down, and whispered something in his ear. Malfoy smirked, too. Harry looked up nervously at Lockhart and said, \"Professor, could you show me that blocking thing again?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Scared?\" muttered Malfoy, so that Lockhart couldn't hear him.\n\u3000\u3000\"You wish,\" said Harry out of the corner of his mouth.\n\u3000\u3000Lockhart cuffed Harry merrily on the shoulder. \"Just do what I did, Harry!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What, drop my wand?\"\n\u3000\u3000But Lockhart wasn't listening.\n\u3000\u3000\"Three - two - one - go!\" he shouted.\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy raised his wand quickly and bellowed, \"Serpensortia!\"\n\u3000\u3000The end of his wand exploded. Harry watched, aghast, as a long black snake shot out of it, fell heavily onto the floor between them, and raised itself, ready to strike. There were screams as the crowd backed swiftly away, clearing the floor.\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't move, Potter,\" said Snape lazily, clearly enjoying the sight of Harry standing motionless, eye to eye with the angry snake. \"I'll get rid of it ......\n\u3000\u3000\"Allow me!\" shouted Lockhart. He brandished his wand at the snake and there was a loud bang; the snake, instead of vanishing, flew ten feet into the air and fell back to the floor with a loud smack. Enraged, hissing furiously, it slithered straight toward Justin Finch-Fletchley and raised itself again, fangs exposed, poised to strike.\n\u3000\u3000Harry wasn't sure what made him do it. He wasn't even aware of deciding to do it. All he knew was that his legs were carrying him forward as though he was on casters and that he had shouted stupidly at the snake, \"Leave him alone!\" And miraculously - inexplicably - the snake slumped to the floor, docile as a thick, black garden hose, its eyes now on Harry. Harry felt the fear drain out of him. He knew the snake wouldn't attack anyone now, though how he knew it, he couldn't have explained.\n\u3000\u3000He looked up at Justin, grinning, expecting to see Justin looking\n\u3000\u3000*194*\n\u3000\u3000relieved, or puzzled, or even grateful - but certainly not angry and scared.\n\u3000\u3000\"What do you think you're playing at?\" he shouted, and before Harry could say anything, Justin had turned and stormed out of the hall.\n\u3000\u3000Snape stepped forward, waved his wand, and the snake vanished in a small puff of black smoke. Snape, too, was looking at Harry in an unexpected way: It was a shrewd and calculating look, and Harry didn't like it. He was also dimly aware of an ominous muttering all around the walls. Then he felt a tugging on the back of his robes.\n\u3000\u3000\"Come on,\" said Rods voice in his ear. \"Move - come on -\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron steered him out of the hall, Hermione hurrying alongside them. As they went through the doors, the people on either side drew away as though they were frightened of catching something. Harry didn't have a clue what was going on, and neither Ron nor Hermione explained anything until they had dragged him all the way up to the empty Gryffindor common room. Then Ron pushed Harry into an armchair and said, \"You're a Parselmouth. Why didn't you tell us?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm a what?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000`A Parselmouth!\" said Ron. \"You can talk to snakes!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I know,\" said Harry. \"I mean, that's only the second time I've ever done it. I accidentally set a boa constrictor on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once - long story - but it was telling me it had never seen Brazil and I sort of set it free without meaning to that was before I knew I was a wizard -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"A boa constrictor told you it had never seen Brazil?\" Ron repeated faintly.\n\u3000\u3000*195*\n\u3000\u3000\"So?\" said Harry. \"I bet loads of people here can do it.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, no they can't,\" said Ron. \"It's not a very common gift. Harry, this is bad.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What's bad?\" said Harry, starting to feel quite angry. \"What's wrong with everyone? Listen, if I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, that's what you said to it?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What d'you mean? You were there - you heard me -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I heard you speaking Parseltongue,\" said Ron. \"Snake language. You could have been saying anything - no wonder Justin panicked, you sounded like you were egging the snake on or something - it was creepy, you know -\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry gaped at him.\n\u3000\u3000\"I spoke a different language? But - I didn't realize - how can I speak a language without knowing I can speak it?\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron shook his head. Both he and Hermione were looking as though someone had died. Harry couldn't see what was so terrible.\n\u3000\u3000\"D'you want to tell me what's wrong with stopping a massive snake biting off Justin's head?\" he said. \"What does it matter how I did it as long as Justin doesn't have to join the Headless Hunt?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It matters,\" said Hermione, speaking at last in a hushed voice, \"because being able to talk to snakes was what Salazar Slytherin was famous for. That's why the symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry's mouth fell open.\n\u3000\u3000\"Exactly,\" said Ron. \"And now the whole school's going to think you're his great-great-great-great-grandson or something -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But I'm not,\" said Harry, with a panic he couldn't quite explain.\n\u3000\u3000\"You'll find that hard to prove,\" said Hermione. \"He lived about a thousand years ago; for all we know, you could be.\"\n\u3000\u3000* IL96 *\n\u3000\u3000Harry lay awake for hours that night. Through a gap in the curtains around his four-poster he watched snow starting to drift past the tower window and wondered . . .\n\u3000\u3000Could he be a descendant of Salazar Slithering? He didn't know anything about his father's family, after all. The Dursleys had always forbidden questions about his wizarding relatives.\n\u3000\u3000Quietly, Harry tried to say something in Parseltongue. The words wouldn't come. It seemed he had to be face-to-face with a snake to do it.\n\u3000\u3000But I'm in Gryffindor, Harry thought. The Sorting Hat wouldn't have put me in here if I had Slytherin blood...\n\u3000\u3000Ah, said a nasty little voice in his brain, but the Sorting Hat wanted to put you in Slytherin, don't you remember?\n\u3000\u3000Harry turned over. He'd see Justin the next day in Herbology and he'd explain that he'd been calling the snake off, not egging it on, which (he thought angrily, pummeling his pillow) any fool should have realized.\n\u3000\u3000By next morning, however, the snow that had begun in the night had turned into a blizzard so thick that the last Herbology lesson of the term was canceled: Professor Sprout wanted to fit socks and scarves on the Mandrakes, a tricky operation she would entrust to no one else, now that it was so important for the Mandrakes to grow quickly and revive Mrs. Norris and Colin Creevey.\n\u3000\u3000Harry fretted about this next to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, while Ron and Hermione used their time off to play a game of wizard chess.\n\u3000\u3000\"For heaven's sake, Harry,\" said Hermione, exasperated, as one\n\u3000\u3000*197*\n\u3000\u3000of Ron's bishops wrestled her knight off his horse and dragged him off the board. \"Go and find Justin if it's so important to you.\"\n\u3000\u3000So Harry got up and left through the portrait hole, wondering where Justin might be.\n\u3000\u3000The castle was darker than it usually was in daytime because of the thick, swirling gray snow at every window. Shivering, Harry walked past classrooms where lessons were taking place, catching snatches of what was happening within. Professor McGonagall was shouting at someone who, by the sound of it, had turned his friend into a badger. Resisting the urge to take a look, Harry walked on by, thinking that Justin might be using his free time to catch up on some work, and deciding to check the library first.\n\u3000\u3000A group of the Hufliepuffs who should have been in Herbology were indeed sitting at the back of the library, but they didn't seem to be working. Between the long lines of high bookshelves, Harry could see that their heads were close together and they were having what looked like an absorbing conversation. He couldn't see whether Justin was among them. He was walking toward them when something of what they were saying met his ears, and he paused to listen, hidden in the Invisibility section.\n\u3000\u3000\"So anyway,\" a stout boy was saying, \"I told Justin to hide up in our dormitory. I mean to say, if Potter's marked him down as his next victim, it's best if he keeps a low profile for a while. Of course, Justin's been waiting for something like this to happen ever since he let slip to Potter he was Muggle-born. Justin actually told him he'd been down for Eton. That's not the kind of thing you bandy about with Slytherin's heir on the loose, is it?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You definitely think it is Potter, then, Ernie?\" said a girl with blonde pigtails anxiously.\n\u3000\u3000198\n\u3000\u3000\"Hannah,\" said the stout boy solemnly, \"he's a Parselmouth. Everyone knows that's the mark of a Dark wizard. Have you ever heard of a decent one who could talk to snakes? They called Slytherin himself Serpent-tongue.\"\n\u3000\u3000There was some heavy murmuring at this, and Ernie went on, \"Remember what was written on the wall? Enemies of the Heir, Beware. Potter had some sort of run-in with Filch. Next thing we know, Flich's cat's attacked. That first year, Creevey, was annoying Potter at the Quidditch match, taking pictures of him while he was lying in the mud. Next thing we know - Creevey's been attacked.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He always seems so nice, though,\" said Hannah uncertainly, \"and, well, he's the one who made You-Know-Who disappear. He can't be all bad, can he?\"\n\u3000\u3000Ernie lowered his voice mysteriously, the Hufflepuffs bent closer, and Harry edged nearer so that he could catch Ernie's words.\n\u3000\u3000\"No one knows how he survived that attack by You-Know-Who. I mean to say, he was only a baby when it happened. He should have been blasted into smithereens. Only a really powerful Dark wizard could have survived a curse like that.\" He dropped his voice until it was barely more than a whisper, and said, \"That's probably why You- Know-Who wanted to kill him in the first place. Didn't want another Dark Lord competing with him. I wonder what other powers Potter's been hiding?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry couldn't take anymore. Clearing his throat loudly, he stepped out from behind the bookshelves. If he hadn't been feeling so angry, he would have found the sight that greeted him funny: Every one of the Hufflepuffs looked as though they had been Petrified by the sight of him, and the color was draining out of Ernie's face.\n\u3000\u3000*199*\n\u3000\u3000\"Hello,\" said Harry. \"I'm looking for Justin Finch-Fletchley.\"\n\u3000\u3000The Hufepuffs' worst fears had clearly been confirmed. They all looked fearfully at Ernie.\n\u3000\u3000\"What do you want with him?\" said Ernie in a quavering voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"I wanted to tell him what really happened with that snake at the Dueling Club,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000Ernie bit his white lips and then, taking a deep breath, said, \"We were all there. We saw what happened.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Then you noticed that after I spoke to it, the snake backed off?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"All I saw,\" said Ernie stubbornly, though he was trembling as he spoke, \"was you speaking Parseltongue and chasing the snake toward Justin. \"\n\u3000\u3000\"I didn't chase it at him!\" Harry said, his voice shaking with anger. \"It didn't even touch him!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It was a very near miss,\" said Ernie. \"And in case you're getting ideas,\" he added hastily, \"I might tell you that you can trace my family back through nine generations of witches and warlocks and my blood's as pure as anyone's, so -\"\n\u3000\u3000- cc I don't care what sort of blood you've got!\" said Harry fiercely. \"Why would I want to attack Muggle-borns?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I've heard you hate those Muggles you live with,\" said Ernie swiftly.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's not possible to live with the Dursleys and not hate them,\" said Harry. \"Id like to see you try it.\"\n\u3000\u3000He turned on his heel and stormed out of the library, earning himself a reproving glare from Madam Pince, who was polishing the gilded cover of a large spellbook.\n\u3000\u3000*200*\n\u3000\u3000Harry blundered up the corridor, barely noticing where he was going, he was in such a fury. The result was that he walked into something very large and solid, which knocked him backward onto the floor.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, hello, Hagrid,\" Harry said, looking up.\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid's face was entirely hidden by a woolly, snow-covered balaclava, but it couldn't possibly be anyone else, as he filled most of the corridor in his moleskin overcoat. A dead rooster was hanging from one of his massive, gloved hands.\n\u3000\u3000\"All righ', Harry?\" he said, pulling up the balaclava so he could speak. \"Why aren't yeh in class?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Canceled,\" said Harry, getting up. \"What're you doing in here?\"\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid held up the limp rooster.\n\u3000\u3000\"Second one killed this term,\" he explained. \"It's either foxes or a Blood-Suckin Bugbear, an' I need the Headmaster's permission ter put a charm around the hen coop.\"\n\u3000\u3000He peered more closely at Harry from under his thick, snowflecked eyebrows.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeh sure yeh're all righ'? Yeh look all hot an' bothered -\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry couldn't bring himself to repeat what Ernie and the rest of the Hufflepuffs had been saying about him.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's nothing,\" he said. \"Id better get going, Hagrid, it's Transfiguration next and I've got to pick up my books.\"\n\u3000\u3000He walked off, his mind still full of what Ernie had said about him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Justin's been waiting for something like this to happen ever since he let slip to Potter he was Muggle-born .....\n\u3000\u3000* 2 0 IL *\n\u3000\u3000Harry stamped up the stairs and turned along another corridor, which was particularly dark; the torches had been extinguished by a strong, icy draft that was blowing through a loose windowpane. He was halfway down the passage when he tripped headlong over something lying on the floor.\n\u3000\u3000He turned to squint at what he'd fallen over and felt as though his stomach had dissolved.\n\u3000\u3000Justin Finch-Fletchley was lying on the floor, rigid and cold, a look of shock frozen on his face, his eyes staring blankly at the ceiling. And that wasn't all. Next to him was another figure, the strangest sight Harry had ever seen.\n\u3000\u3000It was Nearly Headless Nick, no longer pearly-white and transparent, but black and smoky, floating immobile and horizontal, six inches off the floor. His head was half off and his face wore an expression of shock identical to Justin's.\n\u3000\u3000Harry got to his feet, his breathing fast and shallow, his heart doing a kind of drumroll against his ribs. He looked wildly up and down the deserted corridor and saw a line of spiders scuttling as fast as they could away from the bodies. The only sounds were the muffled voices of teachers from the classes on either side.\n\u3000\u3000He could run, and no one would ever know he had been there. But he couldn't just leave them lying here .... He had to get help .... Would anyone believe he hadn't had anything to do with this?\n\u3000\u3000As he stood there, panicking, a door right next to him opened with a bang. Peeves the Poltergeist came shooting out.\n\u3000\u3000\"Why, it's potty wee Potter!\" cackled Peeves, knocking Harry's glasses askew as he bounced past him. \"What's Potter up to? Why's Potter lurking -\"\n\u3000\u3000*202*\n\u3000\u3000Peeves stopped, halfway through a midair somersault. Upside down, he spotted Justin and Nearly Headless Nick. He flipped the right way up, filled his lungs and, before Harry could stop him, screamed, \"ATTACK! ATTACK! ANOTHER ATTACK! NO MORTAL OR GHOST IS SAFE! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES! ATTAAAACK!\"\n\u3000\u3000Crash - crash - crash - door after door flew open along the corridor and people flooded out. For several long minutes, there was a scene of such confusion that Justin was in danger of being squashed and people kept standing in Nearly Headless Nick. Harry found himself pinned against the wall as the teachers shouted for quiet. Professor McGonagall came running, followed by her own class, one of whom still had black-and-white-striped hair. She used her wand to set off aloud bang, which restored silence, and ordered everyone back into their classes. No sooner had the scene cleared somewhat than Ernie the Hufflepuff arrived, panting, on the scene.\n\u3000\u3000\"Caught in the act!\" Ernie yelled, his face stark white, pointing his finger dramatically at Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"That will do, Macmillan!\" said Professor McGonagall sharply.\n\u3000\u3000Peeves was bobbing overhead, now grinning wickedly, surveying the scene; Peeves always loved chaos. As the teachers bent over Justin and Nearly Headless Nick, examining them, Peeves broke into song:\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, Potter, you rotter, oh, what have you done, You're killing off' students, you think it's good fun -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That's enough Peeves!\" barked Professor McGonagall, and Peeves zoomed away backward, with his tongue out at Harry.\n\u3000\u3000*203*\n\u3000\u3000Justin was carried up to the hospital wing by Professor Flitwick and Professor Sinistra of the Astronomy department, but nobody seemed to know what to do for Nearly Headless Nick. In the end, Professor McGonagall conjured a large fan out of thin air, which she gave to Ernie with instructions to waft Nearly Headless Nick up the stairs. This Ernie did, fanning Nick along like a silent black hovercraft. This left Harry and Professor McGonagall alone together.\n\u3000\u3000\"This way, Potter,\" she said.\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor,\" said Harry at once, \"I swear I didn't -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"This is out of my hands, Potter,\" said Professor McGonagall curtly.\n\u3000\u3000They marched in silence around a corner and she stopped before a large and extremely ugly stone gargoyle.\n\u3000\u3000\"Lemon drop!\" she said. This was evidently a password, because the gargoyle sprang suddenly to life and hopped aside as the wall behind him split in two. Even full of dread for what was coming, Harry couldn't fail to be amazed. Behind the wall was a spiral staircase that was moving smoothly upward, like an escalator. As he and Professor McGonagall stepped onto it, Harry heard the wall thud closed behind them. They rose upward in circles, higher and higher, until at last, slightly dizzy, Harry saw a gleaming oak door ahead, with a brass knocker in the shape of a griffin.\n\u3000\u3000He knew now where he was being taken. This must be where Dumbledore lived.\n\u3000\u3000*204*\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER\tTWELVE\n\u3000\u3000THE POLYJUICE POTION\n\u3000\u3000hey stepped off the stone staircase at the top, and Professor McGonagall rapped on the door. It opened silently and they entered. Professor McGonagall told Harry to wait and left him there, alone.\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked around. One thing was certain: of all the teachers' offices Harry had visited so far this year, Dumbledore's was by far the most interesting. If he hadn't been scared out of his wits that he was about to be thrown out of school, he would have been very pleased to have a chance to look around it.\n\u3000\u3000It was a large and beautiful circular room, full of funny little noises. A number of curious silver instruments stood on spindlelegged tables, whirring and emitting little puffs of smoke. The walls were covered with portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses, all of whom were snoozing gently in their frames. There was also an enormous, claw-footed desk, and, sitting on a shelf behind it, a shabby, tattered wizard's hat - the Sorting Hat.\n\u3000\u3000*205*\n\u3000\u3000Harry hesitated. He cast a wary eye around the sleeping witches and wizards on the walls. Surely it couldn't hurt if he took the hat down and tried it on again? Just to see ... just to make sure it had put him in the right House\n\u3000\u3000He walked quietly around the desk, lifted the hat from its shelf, and lowered it slowly onto his head. It was much too large and slipped down over his eyes, just as it had done the last time he'd put it on. Harry stared at the black inside of the hat, waiting. Then a small voice said in his ear, \"Bee in your bonnet, Harry Potter?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Er, yes,\" Harry muttered. \"Er - sorry to bother you - I wanted to ask - \"\n\u3000\u3000\"You've been wondering whether I put you in the right House,\" said the hat smartly. \"Yes ... you were particularly difficult to place. But I stand by what I said before\" - Harry's heart leapt - \"you would have done well in Slytherin -\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry's stomach plummeted. He grabbed the point of the hat and pulled it off. It hung limply in his hand, grubby and faded. Harry pushed it back onto its shelf, feeling sick.\n\u3000\u3000\"You're wrong,\" he said aloud to the still and silent hat. It didn't move. Harry backed away, watching it. Then a strange, gagging noise behind him made him wheel around.\n\u3000\u3000He wasn't alone after all. Standing on a golden perch behind the door was a decrepit-looking bird that resembled a half-plucked turkey. Harry stared at it and the bird looked balefully back, making its gagging noise again. Harry thought it looked very ill. Its eyes were dull and, even as Harry watched, a couple more feathers fell out of its tail.\n\u3000\u3000Harry was just thinking that all he needed was for Dumbledore's\n\u3000\u3000pet bird to die while he was alone in the office with it, when the bird burst into flames.\n\u3000\u3000Harry yelled in shock and backed away into the desk. He looked feverishly around in case there was a glass of water somewhere but couldn't see one; the bird, meanwhile, had become a fireball; it gave one loud shriek and next second there was nothing but a smouldering pile of ash on the floor.\n\u3000\u3000The office door opened. Dumbledore came in, looking very somber.\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor,\" Harry gasped. \"Your bird - I couldn't do anything - he just caught fire -\"\n\u3000\u3000To Harry's astonishment, Dumbledore smiled.\n\u3000\u3000\"About time, too,\" he said. \"He's been looking dreadful for days; I've been telling him to get a move on.\"\n\u3000\u3000He chuckled at the stunned look on Harry's face.\n\u3000\u3000\"Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry. Phoenixes burst into flame when it is time for them to die and are reborn from the ashes. Watch him . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked down in time to see a tiny, wrinkled, newborn bird poke its head out of the ashes. It was quite as ugly as the old one.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's a shame you had to see him on a Burning Day,\" said Dumbledore, seating himself behind his desk. \"He's really very handsome most of the time, wonderful red and gold plumage. Fascinating creatures, phoenixes. They can carry immensely heavy loads, their tears have healing powers, and they make highly faithful pets.\"\n\u3000\u3000In the shock of Fawkes catching fire, Harry had forgotten what he was there for, but it all came back to him as Dumbledore settled\n\u3000\u3000himself in the high chair behind the desk and fixed Harry with his penetrating, light-blue stare.\n\u3000\u3000Before Dumbledore could speak another word, however, the door of the office flew open with an almighty bang and Hagrid burst in, a wild look in his eyes, his balaclava perched on top of his shaggy black head and the dead rooster still swinging from his hand.\n\u3000\u3000\"It wasn' Harry, Professor Dumbledore!\" said Hagrid urgently. \"I was talkin' ter him seconds before that kid was found, he never had time, sir - \"\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore tried to say something, but Hagrid went ranting on, waving the rooster around in his agitation, sending feathers everywhere.\n\u3000\u3000\"- it can't've bin him, I'll swear it in front o' the Ministry o' Magic if I have to -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hagrid, I -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"- yeh've got the wrong boy, sir, I know Harry never ='\n\u3000\u3000\"Hagrid!\" said Dumbledore loudly. \"I do not think that Harry attacked those people.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh,\" said Hagrid, the rooster falling limply at his side. \"Right. I'll wait outside then, Headmaster.\"\n\u3000\u3000And he stomped out looking embarrassed.\n\u3000\u3000\"You don't think it was me, Professor?\" Harry repeated hopefully as Dumbledore brushed rooster feathers off his desk.\n\u3000\u3000\"No, Harry, I don't,\" said Dumbledore, though his face was somber again. \"But I still want to talk to you.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry waited nervously while Dumbledore considered him, the tips of his long fingers together.\n\u3000\u3000*208*\n\u3000\u3000\"I must ask you, Harry, whether there is anything you'd like to tell me,\" he said gently. \"Anything at all.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't know what to say. He thought of Malfoy shouting, \"You'll be next, Mudbloods!\" and of the Polyjuice Potion simmering away in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. Then he thought of the disembodied voice he had heard twice and remembered what Ron had said: \"Hearing voices no one else can hear isn't a good sign, even in the wizarding world.\" He thought, too, about what everyone was saying about him, and his growing dread that he was somehow connected with Salazar Slytherin ....\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Harry. \"There isn't anything, Professor . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000The double attack on Justin and Nearly Headless Nick turned what had hitherto been nervousness into real panic. Curiously, it was Nearly Headless Nick's fate that seemed to worry people most. What could possibly do that to a ghost? people asked each other; what terrible power could harm someone who was already dead? There was almost a stampede to book seats on the Hogwarts Express so that students could go home for Christmas.\n\u3000\u3000\"At this rate, we'll be the only ones left,\" Ron told Harry and Hermione. \"Us, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle. What a jolly holiday it's going to be.\"\n\u3000\u3000Crabbe and Goyle, who always did whatever Malfoy did, had signed up to stay over the holidays, too. But Harry was glad that most people were leaving. He was tired of people skirting around him in the corridors, as though he was about to sprout fangs or spit poison; tired of all the muttering, pointing, and hissing as he passed.\n\u3000\u3000*209*\n\u3000\u3000Fred and George, however, found all this very funny. They went out of their way to march ahead of Harry down the corridors, shouting, \"Make way for the Heir of Slytherin, seriously evil wizard coming through ......\n\u3000\u3000Percy was deeply disapproving of this behavior.\n\u3000\u3000\"It is not a laughing matter,\" he said coldly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, get out of the way, Percy,\" said Fred. \"Harry's in a hurry.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, he's off to the Chamber of Secrets for a cup of tea with his fanged servant,\" said George, chortling.\n\u3000\u3000Ginny didn't find it amusing either.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, don't,\" she wailed every time Fred asked Harry loudly who he was planning to attack next, or when George pretended to ward Harry off with a large clove of garlic when they met.\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't mind; it made him feel better that Fred and George, at least, thought the idea of his being Slytherin's heir was quite ludicrous. But their antics seemed to be aggravating Draco Malfoy, who looked increasingly sour each time he saw them at it.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's because he's bursting to say it's really him,\" said Ron knowingly. \"You know how he hates anyone beating him at anything, and you're getting all the credit for his dirty work.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Not for long,\" said Hermione in a satisfied tone. \"The Polyjuice Potion's nearly ready. We'll be getting the truth out of him any day now.\"\n\u3000\u3000At last the term ended, and a silence deep as the snow on the grounds descended on the castle. Harry found it peaceful, rather than gloomy, and enjoyed the fact that he, Hermione, and the Weasleys had the run of Gryffindor Tower, which meant they could\n\u3000\u3000*210*\n\u3000\u3000play Exploding Snap loudly without bothering anyone, and practice dueling in private. Fred, George, and Ginny had chosen to stay at school rather than visit Bill in Egypt with Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. Percy, who disapproved of what he termed their childish behavior, didn't spend much time in the Gryffindor common room. He had already told them pompously that he was only staying over Christmas because it was his duty as a prefect to support the teachers during this troubled time.\n\u3000\u3000Christmas morning dawned, cold and white. Harry and Ron, the only ones left in their dormitory, were woken very early by Hermione, who burst in, fully dressed and carrying presents for them both.\n\u3000\u3000\"Wake up,\" she said loudly, pulling back the curtains at the window.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione - you're not supposed to be in here -\" said Ron, shielding his eyes against the light.\n\u3000\u3000\"Merry Christmas to you, too,\" said Hermione, throwing him his present. \"I've been up for nearly an hour, adding more lacewings to the potion. It's ready.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry sat up, suddenly wide awake.\n\u3000\u3000\"Are you sure?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Positive,\" said Hermione, shifting Scabbers the rat so that she could sit down on the end of Ron's four-poster. \"If we're going to do it, I say it should be tonight.\"\n\u3000\u3000At that moment, Hedwig swooped into the room, carrying a very small package in her beak.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hello,\" said Harry happily as she landed on his bed. \"Are you speaking to me again?\"\n\u3000\u3000211\n\u3000\u3000She nibbled his ear in an affectionate sort of way, which was a far better present than the one that she had brought him, which turned out to be from the Dursleys. They had sent Harry a toothpick and a note telling him to find out whether he'd be able to stay at Hogwarts for the summer vacation, too.\n\u3000\u3000The rest of Harry's Christmas presents were far more satisfactory. Hagrid had sent him a large tin of treacle fudge, which Harry decided to soften by the fire before eating; Ron had given him a book called Flying with the Cannons, a book of interesting facts about his favorite Quidditch team, and Hermione had bought him a luxury eagle-feather quill. Harry opened the last present to find a new, hand-knitted sweater from Mrs. Weasley and a large plum cake. He read her card with a fresh surge of guilt, thinking about Mr. Weasley's car (which hadn't been seen since its crash with the Whomping Willow), and the bout of rule-breaking he and Ron were planning next.\n\u3000\u3000No one, not even someone dreading taking Polyjuice Potion later, could fail to enjoy Christmas dinner at Hogwarts.\n\u3000\u3000The Great Hall looked magnificent. Not only were there a dozen frost-covered Christmas trees and thick streamers of holly and mistletoe crisscrossing the ceiling, but enchanted snow was falling, warm and dry, from the ceiling. Dumbledore led them in a few of his favorite carols, Hagrid booming more and more loudly with every goblet of eggnog he consumed. Percy, who hadn't noticed that Fred had bewitched his prefect badge so that it now read \"Pinhead,\" kept asking them all what they were sniggering at. Harry didn't even care that Draco Malfoy was making loud, snide remarks\n\u3000\u3000* 2:L2 *\n\u3000\u3000about his new sweater from the Slytherin table. With a bit of luck, Malfoy would be getting his comeuppance in a few hours' time.\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron had barely finished their third helpings of Christmas pudding when Hermione ushered them out of the hall to finalize their plans for the evening.\n\u3000\u3000\"We still need a bit of the people you're changing into,\" said Hermione matter-of-facdy, as though she were sending them to the supermarket for laundry detergent. \"And obviously, it'll be best if you can get something of Crabbe's and Goyle's; they're Malfoys best friends, he'll tell them anything. And we also need to make sure the real Crabbe and Goyle can't burst in on us while we're interrogating him.\n\u3000\u3000\"I've got it all worked out,\" she went on smoothly, ignoring Harry's and Ron's stupefied faces. She held up two plump chocolate cakes. \"I've filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught. All you have to do is make sure Crabbe and Goyle find them. You know how greedy they are, they're bound to eat them. Once they're asleep, pull out a few of their hairs and hide them in a broom closet.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron looked incredulously at each other.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione, I don't think -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That could go seriously wrong -\"\n\u3000\u3000But Hermione had a steely glint in her eye not unlike the one Professor McGonagall sometimes had.\n\u3000\u3000\"The potion will be useless without Crabbe's and Goyle's hair,\" she said sternly. \"You do want to investigate Malfoy, don't you?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, all right, all right,\" said Harry. \"But what about you? Whose hair are you ripping out?\"\n\u3000\u3000*213*\n\u3000\u3000\"I've already got mine!\" said Hermione brightly, pulling a tiny bottle out of her pocket and showing them the single hair inside it. \"Remember Millicent Bulstrode wrestling with me at the Dueling Club? She left this on my robes when she was trying to strangle me! And she's gone home for Christmas - so I'll just have to tell the Slytherins I've decided to come back.\"\n\u3000\u3000When Hermione had bustled off to check on the Polyjuice Potion again, Ron turned to Harry with a doom-laden expression.\n\u3000\u3000\"Have you ever heard of a plan where so many things could go wrong?\"\n\u3000\u3000But to Harry's and Ron's utter amazement, stage one of the operation went just as smoothly as Hermione had said. They lurked in the deserted entrance hall after Christmas tea, waiting for Crabbe and Goyle who had remained alone at the Slytherin table, shoveling down fourth helpings of trifle. Harry had perched the chocolate cakes on the end of the banisters. When they spotted Crabbe and Goyle coming out of the Great Hall, Harry and Ron hid quickly behind a suit of armor next to the front door.\n\u3000\u3000\"How thick can you get?\" Ron whispered ecstatically as Crabbe gleefully pointed out the cakes to Goyle and grabbed them. Grinning stupidly, they stuffed the cakes whole into their large mouths. For a moment, both of them chewed greedily, looks of triumph on their faces. Then, without the smallest change of expression, they both keeled over backward onto the floor.\n\u3000\u3000By far the hardest part was hiding them in the closet across the hall. Once they were safely stowed among the buckets and mops, Harry yanked out a couple of the bristles that covered Goyle's fore\n\u3000\u3000* _2 14 *\n\u3000\u3000head and Ron pulled out several of Crabbe's hairs. They also stole their shoes, because their own were far too small for Crabbe- and Goyle-size feet. Then, still stunned at what they had just done, they sprinted up to Moaning Myrtle's bathroom.\n\u3000\u3000They could hardly see for the thick black smoke issuing from the stall in which Hermione was stirring the cauldron. Pulling their robes up over their faces, Harry and Ron knocked softly on the door.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione?\"\n\u3000\u3000They heard the scrape of the lock and Hermione emerged, shiny- faced and looking anxious. Behind her they heard the gloop gloop of the bubbling, glutinous potion. Three glass tumblers stood ready on the toilet seat.\n\u3000\u3000\"Did you get them?\" Hermione asked breathlessly.\n\u3000\u3000Harry showed her Goyle's hair.\n\u3000\u3000\"Good. And I sneaked these spare robes out of the laundry,\" Hermione said, holding up a small sack. \"You'll need bigger sizes once you're Crabbe and Goyle.\"\n\u3000\u3000The three of them stared into the cauldron. Close up, the potion looked like thick, dark mud, bubbling sluggishly.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm sure I've done everything right,\" said Hermione, nervously rereading the splotched page of Moste Potente Potions. \"It looks like the book says it should ... once we've drunk it, we'll have exactly an hour before we change back into ourselves.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Now what?\" Ron whispered.\n\u3000\u3000\"We separate it into three glasses and add the hairs.\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione ladled large dollops of the potion into each of the glasses. Then, her hand trembling, she shook Millicent Bulstrode's hair out of its bottle into the first glass.\n\u3000\u3000*215*\n\u3000\u3000The potion hissed loudly like a boiling kettle and frothed madly. A second later, it had turned a sick sort of yellow.\n\u3000\u3000\"Urgh - essence of Millicent Bulstrode,\" said Ron, eyeing it with loathing. \"Bet it tastes disgusting.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Add yours, then,\" said Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000Harry dropped Goyle's hair into the middle glass and Ron put Crabbe's into the last one. Both glasses hissed and frothed: Goyle's turned the khaki color of a booger, Crabbe's a dark, murky brown.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hang on,\" said Harry as Ron and Hermione reached for their glasses. \"We'd better not all drink them in here .... Once we turn into Crabbe and Goyle we won't fit. And Millicent Bulstrode's no pixie.\n\u3000\u3000\"Good thinking,\" said Ron, unlocking the door. \"We'll take separate stalls.\"\n\u3000\u3000Careful not to spill a drop of his Polyjuice Potion, Harry slipped into the middle stall.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ready?\" he called.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ready,\" came Ron's and Hermione's voices.\n\u3000\u3000\"One - two - three -\"\n\u3000\u3000Pinching his nose, Harry drank the potion down in two large gulps. It tasted like overcooked cabbage.\n\u3000\u3000Immediately, his insides started writhing as though he'd just swallowed live snakes - doubled up, he wondered whether he was going to be sick - then a burning sensation spread rapidly from his stomach to the very ends of his fingers and toes - next, bringing him gasping to all fours, came a horrible melting feeling, as the skin all over his body bubbled like hot wax - and before his eyes, his hands began to grow, the fingers thickened, the nails broadened,\n\u3000\u3000* 2116 *\n\u3000\u3000the knuckles were bulging like bolts -his shoulders stretched painfully and a prickling on his forehead told him that hair was creeping down toward his eyebrows - his robes ripped as his chest expanded like a barrel bursting its hoops - his feet were agony in shoes four sizes too small\n\u3000\u3000As suddenly as it had started, everything stopped. Harry lay facedown on the stone-cold floor, listening to Myrtle gurgling morosely in the end toilet. With difficulty, he kicked off his shoes and stood up. So this was what it felt like, being Goyle. His large hand trembling, he pulled off his old robes, which were hanging a foot above his ankles, pulled on the spare ones, and laced up Goyle's boatlike shoes. He reached up to brush his hair out of his eyes and met only the short growth of wiry bristles, low on his forehead. Then he realized that his glasses were clouding his eyes because Goyle obviously didn't need them - he took them off and called, \"Are you two okay?\" Goyle's low rasp of a voice issued from his mouth.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah,\" came the deep grunt of Crabbe from his right.\n\u3000\u3000Harry unlocked his door and stepped in front of the cracked mirror. Goyle stared back at him out of dull, deepset eyes. Harry scratched his ear. So did Goyle.\n\u3000\u3000Ron's door opened. They stared at each other. Except that he looked pale and shocked, Ron was indistinguishable from Crabbe, from the pudding-bowl haircut to the long, gorilla arms.\n\u3000\u3000\"This is unbelievable,\" said Ron, approaching the mirror and prodding Crabbe's flat nose. \"Unbelievable. \"\n\u3000\u3000\"We'd better get going,\" said Harry, loosening the watch that was cutting into Goyle's thick wrist. \"We've still got to find out\n\u3000\u3000* 217*\n\u3000\u3000where the Slytherin common room is. I only hope we can find someone to follow. . .\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron, who had been gazing at Harry, said, \"You don't know how bizarre it is to see Goyle thinking.\" He banged on Hermione's door. \"C'mon, we need to go -\"\n\u3000\u3000A high-pitched voice answered him.\n\u3000\u3000\"I - I don't think I'm going to come after all. You go on without me.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione, we know Millicent Bulstrode's ugly, no one's going to know it's you -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No - really - I don't think I'll come. You two hurry up, you re wasting time\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked at Ron, bewildered.\n\u3000\u3000\"That looks more like Goyle,\" said Ron. \"That's how he looks every time a teacher asks him a question.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione, are you okay?\" said Harry through the door.\n\u3000\u3000\"Fine - I'm fine - go on -\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked at his watch. Five of their precious sixty minutes had already passed.\n\u3000\u3000\"We'll meet you back here, all right?\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron opened the door of the bathroom carefully, checked that the coast was clear, and set off.\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't swing your arms like that,\" Harry muttered to Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Eh?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Crabbe holds them sort of stiff . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"How's this?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, that's better . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000They went down the marble staircase. All they needed now was\n\u3000\u3000*218*\n\u3000\u3000a Slytherin that they could follow to the Slytherin common room, but there was nobody around.\n\u3000\u3000\"Any ideas?\" muttered Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"The Slytherins always come up to breakfast from over there,\" said Ron, nodding at the entrance to the dungeons. The words had barely left his mouth when a girl with long, curly hair emerged from the entrance.\n\u3000\u3000\"Excuse me,\" said Ron, hurrying up to her. \"We've forgotten the way to our common room.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I beg your pardon?\" said the girl stiffly. \"Our common room? I'm a Ravenclaw.\"\n\u3000\u3000She walked away, looking suspiciously back at them.\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron hurried down the stone steps into the darkness, their footsteps echoing particularly loudly as Crabbe's and Goyle's huge feet hit the floor, feeling that this wasn't going to be as easy as they had hoped.\n\u3000\u3000The labyrinthine passages were deserted. They walked deeper and deeper under the school, constantly checking their watches to see how much time they had left. After a quarter of an hour, just when they were getting desperate, they heard a sudden movement ahead.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ha!\" said Ron excitedly. \"There's one of them now!\"\n\u3000\u3000The figure was emerging from a side room. As they hurried nearer, however, their hearts sank. It wasn't a Slytherin, it was Percy.\n\u3000\u3000\"What're you doing down here?\" said Ron in surprise.\n\u3000\u3000Percy looked affronted.\n\u3000\u3000\"That,\" he said stiffly, \"is none of your business. It's Crabbe, isn't it?\"\n\u3000\u30002 19\n\u3000\u3000\"Wh - oh, yeah,\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, get off to your dormitories,\" said Percy sternly. \"It's not safe to go wandering around dark corridors these days.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You are,\" Ron pointed out.\n\u3000\u3000\"I,\" said Percy, drawing himself up, \"am a prefect. Nothing's about to attack me.\"\n\u3000\u3000A voice suddenly echoed behind Harry and Ron. Draco Malfoy was strolling toward them, and for the first time in his life, Harry was pleased to see him.\n\u3000\u3000\"There you are,\" he drawled, looking at them. \"Have you two been pigging out in the Great Hall all this time? I've been looking for you; I want to show you something really funny.\"\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy glanced witheringly at Percy.\n\u3000\u3000\"And what're you doing down here, Weasley?\" he sneered.\n\u3000\u3000Percy looked outraged.\n\u3000\u3000\"You want to show a bit more respect to a school prefect!\" he said. \"I don't like your attitude!\"\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy sneered and motioned for Harry and Ron to follow him. Harry almost said something apologetic to Percy but caught himself just in time. He and Ron hurried after Malfoy, who said as they turned into the next passage, \"That Peter Weasley -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Percy,\" Ron corrected him automatically.\n\u3000\u3000\"Whatever,\" said Malfoy. \"I've noticed him sneaking around a lot lately. And I bet I know what he's up to. He thinks he's going to catch Slytherin's heir single-handed.\"\n\u3000\u3000He gave a short, derisive laugh. Harry and Ron exchanged excited looks.\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy paused by a stretch of bare, damp stone wall.\n\u3000\u3000* 220 *\n\u3000\u3000\"What's the new password again?\" he said to Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Er -\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, yeah -pure-blood!\" said Malfoy, not listening, and a stone door concealed in the wall slid open. Malfoy marched through it, and Harry and Ron followed him.\n\u3000\u3000The Slytherin common room was a long, low underground room with rough stone walls and ceiling from which round, greenish lamps were hanging on chains. A fire was crackling under an elaborately carved mantelpiece ahead of them, and several Slytherins were silhouetted around it in high-backed chairs.\n\u3000\u3000\"Wait here,\" said Malfoy to Harry and Ron, motioning them to a pair of empty chairs set back from the fire. \"I'll go and get it my father's just sent it to me -\"\n\u3000\u3000Wondering what Malfoy was going to show them, Harry and Ron sat down, doing their best to look at home.\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy came back a minute later, holding what looked like a newspaper clipping. He thrust it under Ron's nose.\n\u3000\u3000\"That'll give you a laugh,\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000Harry saw Ron's eyes widen in shock. He read the clipping quickly, gave a very forced laugh, and handed it to Harry.\n\u3000\u3000It had been clipped out of the Daily Prophet, and it said:\n\u3000\u3000INQUIRY AT THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC\n\u3000\u3000Arthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office, was today fined fifty Galleons for bewitching a Muggle car.\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Lucius Malfoy, a governor of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where the\n\u3000\u3000221\n\u3000\u3000enchanted car crashed earlier this year, called today for Mr. Weasley's resignation.\n\u3000\u3000\"Weasley has brought the Ministry into disrepute,\" Mr. Malfoy told our reporter. \"He is clearly unfit to draw up our laws and his ridiculous Muggle Protection Act should be scrapped immediately.\"\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Weasley was unavailable for comment, although his wife told reporters to clear off or she'd set the family ghoul on them.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well?\" said Malfoy impatiently as Harry handed the clipping back to him. \"Don't you think it's funny?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ha, ha,\" said Harry bleakly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Arthur Weasley loves Muggles so much he should snap his wand in half and go and join them,\" said Malfoy scornfully. \"You'd never know the Weasleys were pure-bloods, the way they behave.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron's - or rather, Crabbe's - face was contorted with fury.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's up with you, Crabbe?\" snapped Malfoy.\n\u3000\u3000\"Stomachache,\" Ron grunted.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, go up to the hospital wing and give all those Mudbloods a kick from me,\" said Malfoy, snickering. \"You know, I'm surprised the Daily Prophet hasn't reported all these attacks yet,\" he went on thoughtfully. \"I suppose Dumbledore's trying to hush it all up. He'll be sacked if it doesn't stop soon. Father's always said old Dumbledore's the worst thing that's ever happened to this place. He loves Muggle-borns. A decent headmaster would never've let slime like that Creevey in.\"\n\u3000\u3000*222*\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy started taking pictures with an imaginary camera and did a cruel but accurate impression of Colin: \"`Potter, can I have your picture, Potter? Can I have your autograph? Can I lick your shoes, please, Potter?\"'\n\u3000\u3000He dropped his hands and looked at Harry and Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's the matter with you two?\"\n\u3000\u3000Far too late, Harry and Ron forced themselves to laugh, but Malfoy seemed satisfied; perhaps Crabbe and Goyle were always slow on the uptake.\n\u3000\u3000\"Saint Potter, the Mudbloods' friend,\" said Malfoy slowly. \"He's another one with no proper wizard feeling, or he wouldn't go around with that jumped up Granger Mudblood. And people think he's Slytherin's heir!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron waited with bated breath: Malfoy was surely seconds away from telling them it was him - but then\n\u3000\u3000\"I wish I knew who it is,\" said Malfoy petulantly. \"I could help them.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron's jaw dropped so that Crabbe looked even more clueless than usual. Fortunately, Malfoy didn't notice, and Harry, thinking fast, said, \"You must have some idea who's behind it all ......\n\u3000\u3000\"You know I haven't, Goyle, how many times do I have to tell you?\" snapped Malfoy. \"And Father won't tell me anything about the last time the Chamber was opened either. Of course, it was fifty years ago, so it was before his time, but he knows all about it, and he says that it was all kept quiet and it'll look suspicious if I know too much about it. But I know one thing - last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died. So I bet it's a matter of time before one of them's killed this time .... I hope it's Granger,\" he said with relish.\n\u3000\u3000Ron was clenching Crabbe's gigantic fists. Feeling that it would be a bit of a giveaway if Ron punched Malfoy, Harry shot him a warning look and said, \"D'you know if the person who opened the Chamber last time was caught?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, yeah ... whoever it was was expelled,\" said Malfoy. \"They're probably still in Azkaban.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Azkaban?\" said Harry, puzzled.\n\u3000\u3000\"Azkaban - the wizard prison, Goyle,\" said Malfoy, looking at him in disbelief \"Honestly, if you were any slower, you'd be going backward.\"\n\u3000\u3000He shifted restlessly in his chair and said, \"Father says to keep my head down and let the Heir of Slytherin get on with it. He says the school needs ridding of all the Mudblood filth, but not to get mixed up in it. Of course, he's got a lot on his plate at the moment. You know the Ministry of Magic raided our manor last week?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry tried to force Goyle's dull face into a look of concern.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah. . .\" said Malfoy. \"Luckily, they didn't find much. Father's got some very valuable Dark Arts stuff. But luckily, we've got our own secret chamber under the drawing-room floor -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ho!\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy looked at him. So did Harry. Ron blushed. Even his hair was turning red. His nose was also slowly lengthening - their hour was up, Ron was turning back into himself, and from the look of horror he was suddenly giving Harry, he must be, too.\n\u3000\u3000They both jumped to their feet.\n\u3000\u3000 \"Medicine for my stomach,\" Ron grunted, and without further ado they sprinted the length of the Slytherin common room, hurled themselves at the stone wall, and dashed up the passage, hoping against hope that Malfoy hadn't noticed anything. Harry\n\u3000\u3000 224\n\u3000\u3000could feel his feet slipping around in Goyle's huge shoes and had to hoist up his robes as he shrank; they crashed up the steps into the dark entrance hall, which was full of a muffled pounding coming from the closet where they'd locked Crabbe and Goyle. Leaving their shoes outside the closet door, they sprinted in their socks up the marble staircase toward Moaning Myrtle's bathroom.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, it wasn't a complete waste of time,\" Ron panted, closing the bathroom door behind them. \"I know we still haven't found out who's doing the attacks, but I'm going to write to Dad tomorrow and tell him to check under the Malfoys' drawing room.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry checked his face in the cracked mirror. He was back to normal. He put his glasses on as Ron hammered on the door of Hermione's stall.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione, come out, we've got loads to tell you -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Go away!\" Hermione squeaked.\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron looked at each other.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's the matter?\" said Ron. \"You must be back to normal by now, we are\n\u3000\u3000But Moaning Myrtle glided suddenly through the stall door. Harry had never seen her looking so happy.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ooooooh, wait till you see,\" she said. \"It's awful-\"\n\u3000\u3000They heard the lock slide back and Hermione emerged, sobbing, her robes pulled up over her head.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's up?\" said Ron uncertainly. \"Have you still got Millicent's nose or something?\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione let her robes fall and Ron backed into the sink.\n\u3000\u3000Her face was covered in black fur. Her eyes had turned yellow and there were long, pointed ears poking through her hair.\n\u3000\u3000\"It was a c-cat hair!\" she howled. \"M-Millicent Bulstrode\n\u3000\u3000*225*\n\u3000\u3000m-must have a cat! And the p-potion isn't supposed to be used for animal transformations!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Uh-oh,\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"You'll be teased something dreadful,\" said Myrtle happily.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's okay, Hermione,\" said Harry quickly. \"We'll take you up to the hospital wing. Madam Pomfrey never asks too many questions ......\n\u3000\u3000It took a long time to persuade Hermione to leave the bathroom. Moaning Myrtle sped them on their way with a hearty guffaw. \"Wait till everyone finds out you've got a tail!\"\n\u3000\u3000ermione remained in the hospital wing for several weeks. There was a flurry of rumor about her disappearance when the rest of the school arrived back from their Christmas holidays, because of course everyone thought that she had been attacked. So many students filed past the hospital wing trying to catch a glimpse of her that Madam Pomfrey took out her curtains again and placed them around Hermione's bed, to spare her the shame of being seen with a furry face.\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron went to visit her every evening. When the new term started, they brought her each day's homework.\n\u3000\u3000\"If Id sprouted whiskers, Id take a break from work,\" said Ron, tipping a stack of books onto Hermione's bedside table one evening.\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't be silly, Ron, I've got to keep up,\" said Hermione briskly. Her spirits were greatly improved by the fact that all the hair had\n\u3000\u3000* \"21 *\n\u3000\u3000gone from her face and her eyes were turning slowly back to brown. \"I don't suppose you've got any new leads?\" she added in a whisper, so that Madam Pomfrey couldn't hear her.\n\u3000\u3000\"Nothing,\" said Harry gloomily.\n\u3000\u3000\"I was so sure it was Malfoy,\" said Ron, for about the hundredth time.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's that?\" asked Harry, pointing to something gold sticking out from under Hermione's pillow.\n\u3000\u3000\"Just a get well card,\" said Hermione hastily, trying to poke it out of sight, but Ron was too quick for her. He pulled it out, flicked it open, and read aloud:\n\u3000\u3000\"To Miss Granger, wishing you a speedy recovery, from your concerned teacher, Professor Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League, and five-time winner of Witch Weekly's Most- Charming-Smile Award. \"\n\u3000\u3000Ron looked up at Hermione, disgusted.\n\u3000\u3000\"You sleep with this under your pillow?\"\n\u3000\u3000But Hermione was spared answering by Madam Pomfrey sweeping over with her evening dose of medicine.\n\u3000\u3000\"Is Lockhart the smarmiest bloke you've ever met, or what?\" Ron said to Harry as they left the infirmary and started up the stairs toward Gryffindor Tower. Snape had given them so much homework, Harry thought he was likely to be in the sixth year before he finished it. Ron was just saying he wished he had asked Hermione how many rat tails you were supposed to add to a HairRaising Potion when an angry outburst from the floor above reached their ears.\n\u3000\u3000\"That's Filch,\" Harry muttered as they hurried up the stairs and paused, out of sight, listening hard.\n\u3000\u3000* 228*\n\u3000\u3000\"You don't think someone else's been attacked?\" said Ron tensely.\n\u3000\u3000They stood still, their heads inclined toward Flich's voice, which sounded quite hysterical.\n\u3000\u3000`= even more work for me! Mopping all night, like I haven't got enough to do! No, this is the final straw, I'm going to Dumbledore -\"\n\u3000\u3000His footsteps receded along the out-of-sight corridor and they heard a distant door slam.\n\u3000\u3000They poked their heads around the corner. Filch had clearly been manning his usual lookout post: They were once again on the spot where Mrs. Norris had been attacked. They saw at a glance what Filch had been shouting about. A great flood of water stretched over half the corridor, and it looked as though it was still seeping from under the door of Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. Now that Filch had stopped shouting, they could hear Myrtle's wails echoing off the bathroom walls.\n\u3000\u3000\"Now what's up with her?\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Let's go and see,\" said Harry, and holding their robes over their ankles they stepped through the great wash of water to the door bearing its OUT OF ORDER sign, ignored it as always, and entered.\n\u3000\u3000Moaning Myrtle was crying, if possible, louder and harder than ever before. She seemed to be hiding down her usual toilet. It was dark in the bathroom because the candles had been extinguished in the great rush of water that had left both walls and floor soaking wet.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's up, Myrtle?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Who's that?\" glugged Myrtle miserably. \"Come to throw something else at me?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry waded across to her stall and said, \"Why would I throw something at you?\"\n\u3000\u3000*229*\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't ask me,\" Myrtle shouted, emerging with a wave of yet more water, which splashed onto the already sopping floor. \"Here I am, minding my own business, and someone thinks it's funny to throw a book at me ......\n\u3000\u3000\"But it can't hurt you if someone throws something at you,\" said Harry, reasonably. \"I mean, it'd just go right through you, wouldn't it?\"\n\u3000\u3000He had said the wrong thing. Myrtle puffed herself up and shrieked, \"Let's all throw books at Myrtle, because she can't feel it! Ten points if you can get it through her stomach! Fifty points if it goes through her head! Well, ha, ha, ha! What a lovely game, I don't think!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Who threw it at you, anyway?\" asked Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't know... I was just sitting in the U-bend, thinking about death, and it fell right through the top of my head,\" said Myrtle, glaring at them. \"It's over there, it got washed out ......\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron looked under the sink where Myrtle was pointing. A small, thin book lay there. It had a shabby black cover and was as wet as everything else in the bathroom. Harry stepped forward to pick it up, but Ron suddenly flung out an arm to hold him back.\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Are you crazy?\" said Ron. \"It could be dangerous.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Dangerous?\"said Harry, laughing. \"Come off it, how could it be dangerous?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You'd be surprised,\" said Ron, who was looking apprehensively at the book. \"Some of the books the Ministry's confiscated Dad's told me - there was one that burned your eyes out. And\n\u3000\u3000*2%0*\n\u3000\u3000everyone who read Sonnets of a Sorcerer spoke in limericks for the rest of their lives. And some old witch in Bath had a book that you could never stop reading! You just had to wander around with your nose in it, trying to do everything one-handed. And -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"All right, I've got the point,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000The little book lay on the floor, nondescript and soggy.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, we won't find out unless we look at it,\" he said, and he ducked around Ron and picked it up off the floor.\n\u3000\u3000Harry saw at once that it was a diary, and the faded year on the cover told him it was fifty years old. He opened it eagerly. On the first page he could just make out the name \"T M. Riddle\" in smudged ink.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hang on,\" said Ron, who had approached cautiously and was looking over Harry's shoulder. \"I know that name .... T. M. Riddle got an award for special services to the school fifty years ago.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"How on earth d'you know that?\" said Harry in amazement.\n\u3000\u3000\"Because Filch made me polish his shield about fifty times in detention,\" said Ron resentfully. \"That was the one I burped slugs all over. If you'd wiped slime off a name for an hour, you'd remember it, too.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry peeled the wet pages apart. They were completely blank. There wasn't the faintest trace of writing on any of them, not even Auntie Mabel's birthday, or dentist, half-past three.\n\u3000\u3000\"He never wrote in it,\" said Harry, disappointed.\n\u3000\u3000\"I wonder why someone wanted to flush it away?\" said Ron curiously.\n\u3000\u3000Harry turned to the back cover of the book and saw the printed name of a variety store on Vauxhall Road, London.\n\u3000\u3000*231 *\n\u3000\u3000\"He must've been Muggle-born,\" said Harry thoughtfufly. \"To have bought a diary from Vauxhall Road ......\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, it's not much use to you,\" said Ron. He dropped his voice. \"Fifty points if you can get it through Myrtle's nose.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry, however, pocketed it.\n\u3000\u3000Hermione left the hospital wing, de-whiskered, tail-less, and furfree, at the beginning of February. On her first evening back in Gryffindor Tower, Harry showed her T. M. Riddle's diary and told her the story of how they had found it.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oooh, it might have hidden powers,\" said Hermione enthusiastically, taking the diary and looking at it closely.\n\u3000\u3000\"If it has, it's hiding them very well,\" said Ron. \"Maybe it's shy. I don't know why you don't chuck it, Harry.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I wish I knew why someone did try to chuck it,\" said Harry. \"I wouldn't mind knowing how Riddle got an award for special services to Hogwarts either.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Could've been anything,\" said Ron. \"Maybe he got thirty O.WL.s or saved a teacher from the giant squid. Maybe he murdered Myrtle; that would've done everyone a favor .....\n\u3000\u3000But Harry could tell from the arrested look on Hermione's face that she was thinking what he was thinking.\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" said Ron, looking from one to the other.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, the Chamber of Secrets was opened fifty years ago, wasn't it?\" he said. \"That's what Malfoy said.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah. . .\" said Ron slowly.\n\u3000\u3000\"And this diary is fifty years old,\" said Hermione, tapping it excitedly.\n\u3000\u3000*232*\n\u3000\u3000a so?\n\u3000\u3000.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, Ron, wake up,\" snapped Hermione. \"We know the person who opened the Chamber last time was expelled fifty years ago. We know T. M. Riddle got an award for special services to the school fifty years ago. Well, what if Riddle got his special award for catching the Heir of Slytherin? His diary would probably tell us everything - where the Chamber is, and how to open it, and what sort of creature lives in it - the person who's behind the attacks this time wouldn't want that lying around, would they?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That's a brilliant theory, Hermione,\" said Ron, \"with just one tiny little flaw. There's nothing written in his diary.\"\n\u3000\u3000But Hermione was pulling her wand out of her bag.\n\u3000\u3000\"It might be invisible ink!\" she whispered.\n\u3000\u3000She tapped the diary three times and said, \"Aparecium!\"\n\u3000\u3000Nothing happened. Undaunted, Hermione shoved her hand back into her bag and pulled out what appeared to be a bright red eraser.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's a Revealer, I got it in Diagon Alley,\" she said.\n\u3000\u3000She rubbed hard on January first. Nothing happened.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm telling you, there's nothing to find in there,\" said Ron. \"Riddle just got a diary for Christmas and couldn't be bothered filling it in.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry couldn't explain, even to himself, why he didn't just throw Riddle's diary away. The fact was that even though he knew the diary was blank, he kept absentmindedly picking it up and turning the pages, as though it were a story he wanted to finish. And while Harry was sure he had never heard the name T. M. Riddle before, it still seemed to mean something to him, almost as though\n\u3000\u3000* 233 *\n\u3000\u3000Riddle was a friend he'd had when he was very small, and had halfforgotten. But this was absurd. He'd never had friends before Hogwarts, Dudley had made sure of that.\n\u3000\u3000Nevertheless, Harry was determined to find out more about Riddle, so next day at break, he headed for the trophy room to examine Riddle's special award, accompanied by an interested Hermione and a thoroughly unconvinced Ron, who told them he'd seen enough of the trophy room to last him a lifetime.\n\u3000\u3000Riddle's burnished gold shield was tucked away in a corner cabinet. It didn't carry details of why it had been given to him (\"Good thing, too, or it'd be even bigger and Id still be polishing it,\" said Ron). However, they did find Riddle's name on an old Medal for Magical Merit, and on a list of old Head Boys.\n\u3000\u3000\"He sounds like Percy,\" said Ron, wrinkling his nose in disgust. \"Prefect, Head Boy ... probably top of every class -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You say that like it's a bad thing,\" said Hermione in a slightly hurt voice.\n\u3000\u3000The sun had now begun to shine weakly on Hogwarts again. Inside the castle, the mood had grown more hopeful. There had been no more attacks since those on Justin and Nearly Headless Nick, and Madam Pomfrey was pleased to report that the Mandrakes were becoming moody and secretive, meaning that they were fast leaving childhood.\n\u3000\u3000\"The moment their acne clears up, they'll be ready for repotting again,\" Harry heard her telling Filch kindly one afternoon. \"And after that, it won't be long until we're cutting them up and stewing them. You'll have Mrs. Norris back in no time.\"\n\u3000\u3000* 243 *\n\u3000\u3000Perhaps the Heir of Slytherin had lost his or her nerve, thought Harry. It must be getting riskier and riskier to open the Chamber of Secrets, with the school so alert and suspicious. Perhaps the monster, whatever it was, was even now settling itself down to hibernate for another fifty years ....\n\u3000\u3000Ernie Macmillan of Hufflepuff didn't take this cheerful view. He was still convinced that Harry was the guilty one, that he had \"given himself away\" at the Dueling Club. Peeves wasn't helping matters; he kept popping up in the crowded corridors singing \"Oh, Potter, you rotter . . .\" now with a dance routine to match.\n\u3000\u3000Gilderoy Lockhart seemed to think he himself had made the attacks stop. Harry overheard him telling Professor McGonagall so while the Gryffindors were lining up for Transfiguration.\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't think there'll be any more trouble, Minerva,\" he said, tapping his nose knowingly and winking. \"I think the Chamber has been locked for good this time. The culprit must have known it was only a matter of time before I caught him. Rather sensible to stop now, before I came down hard on him.\n\u3000\u3000\"You know, what the school needs now is a morale-booster. Wash away the memories of last term! I won't say any more just now, but I think I know just the thing . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000He tapped his nose again and strode off.\n\u3000\u3000Lockhart's idea of a morale-booster became clear at breakfast time on February fourteenth. Harry hadn't had much sleep because of a late- running Quidditch practice the night before, and he hurried down to the Great Hall, slightly late. He thought, for a moment, that he'd walked through the wrong doors.\n\u3000\u3000The walls were all covered with large, lurid pink flowers. Worse\n\u3000\u3000* 235*\n\u3000\u3000still, heart-shaped confetti was falling from the pale blue ceiling. Harry went over to the Gryffindor table, where Ron was sitting looking sickened, and Hermione seemed to have been overcome with giggles.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's going on?\" Harry asked them, sitting down and wiping confetti off his bacon.\n\u3000\u3000Ron pointed to the teachers' table, apparently too disgusted to speak. Lockhart, wearing lurid pink robes to match the decorations, was waving for silence. The teachers on either side of him were looking stony-faced. From where he sat, Harry could see a muscle going in Professor McGonagall's cheek. Snape looked as though someone had just fed him a large beaker of Skele-Gro.\n\u3000\u3000\"Happy Valentine's Day!\" Lockhart shouted. \"And may I thank the forty-six people who have so far sent me cards! Yes, I have taken the liberty of arranging this little surprise for you all - and it doesn't end here!\"\n\u3000\u3000Lockhart clapped his hands and through the doors to the entrance hall marched a dozen surly-looking dwarfs. Not just any dwarfs, however. Lockhart had them all wearing golden wings and carrying harps.\n\u3000\u3000\"My friendly, card-carrying cupids!\" beamed Lockhart. \"They will be roving around the school today delivering your valentines! And the fun doesn't stop here! I'm sure my colleagues will want to enter into the spirit of the occasion! Why not ask Professor Snape to show you how to whip up a Love Potion! And while you're at it, Professor Flitwick knows more about Entrancing Enchantments than any wizard I've ever met, the sly old dog!\"\n\u3000\u3000Professor Flitwick buried his face in his hands. Snape was look\n\u3000\u3000* 236\n\u3000\u3000ing as though the first person to ask him for a Love Potion would be force-fed poison.\n\u3000\u3000\"Please, Hermione, tell me you weren't one of the forty-six, 51 said Ron as they left the Great Hall for their first lesson. Hermione suddenly became very interested in searching her bag for her schedule and didn't answer.\n\u3000\u3000All day long, the dwarfs kept barging into their classes to deliver valentines, to the annoyance of the teachers, and late that afternoon as the Gryffindors were walking upstairs for Charms, one of the dwarfs caught up with Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oy, you! 'Arty Potter!\" shouted a particularly grim-looking dwarf, elbowing people out of the way to get to Harry.\n\u3000\u3000Hot all over at the thought of being given a valentine in front of a line of first years, which happened to include Ginny Weasley, Harry tried to escape. The dwarf, however, cut his way through the crowd by kicking people's shins, and reached him before he'd gone two paces.\n\u3000\u3000\"I've got a musical message to deliver to 'Arry Potter in person,\" he said, twanging his harp in a threatening sort of way.\n\u3000\u3000\"Not here,\" Harry hissed, trying to escape.\n\u3000\u3000\"Stay still!\" grunted the dwarf, grabbing hold of Harry's bag and pulling him back.\n\u3000\u3000\"Let me go!\" Harry snarled, tugging.\n\u3000\u3000With a loud ripping noise, his bag split in two. His books, wand, parchment, and quill spilled onto the floor and his ink bottle smashed over everything.\n\u3000\u3000Harry scrambled around, trying to pick it all up before the dwarf started singing, causing something of a holdup in the corridor.\n\u3000\u3000*237*\n\u3000\u3000\"What's going on here?\" came the cold, drawling voice of Draco Malfoy. Harry started stuffing everything feverishly into his ripped bag, desperate to get away before Malfoy could hear his musical valentine.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's all this commotion?\" said another familiar voice as Percy Weasley arrived.\n\u3000\u3000Losing his head, Harry tried to make a run for it, but the dwarf seized him around the knees and brought him crashing to the floor.\n\u3000\u3000\"Right,\" he said, sitting on Harry's ankles. \"Here is your singing valentine:\n\u3000\u3000His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad,\n\u3000\u3000His hair is as dark as a blackboard. I wish he was mine, he's really divine, The hero who conquered the Dark Lord\n\u3000\u3000Harry would have given all the gold in Gringotts to evaporate on the spot. Trying valiantly to laugh along with everyone else, he got up, his feet numb from the weight of the dwarf, as Percy Weasley did his best to disperse the crowd, some of whom were crying with mirth.\n\u3000\u3000\"Off you go, off you go, the bell rang five minutes ago, off to class, now,\" he said, shooing some of the younger students away. \"And you, Malfoy-\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry, glancing over, saw Malfoy stoop and snatch up something. Leering, he showed it to Crabbe and Goyle, and Harry realized that he'd got Riddle's diary.\n\u3000\u3000\"Give that back,\" said Harry quietly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Wonder what Potter's written in this?\" said Malfoy, who obvi\n\u3000\u3000* 238\n\u3000\u3000ously hadn't noticed the year on the cover and thought he had Harry's own diary. A hush fell over the onlookers. Ginny was staring from the diary to Harry, looking terrified.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hand it over, Malfoy,\" said Percy sternly.\n\u3000\u3000\"When I've had a look,\" said Malfoy, waving the diary tauntingly at Harry.\n\u3000\u3000Percy said, \"As a school prefect -\" but Harry had lost his temper. He pulled out his wand and shouted, \"Expelliarmus!\" and just as Snape had disarmed Lockhart, so Malfoy found the diary shooting out of his hand into the air. Ron, grinning broadly, caught it.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry!\" said Percy loudly. \"No magic in the corridors. I'll have to report this, you know!\"\n\u3000\u3000But Harry didn't care, he was one-up on Malfoy, and that was worth five points from Gryffindor any day. Malfoy was looking furious, and as Ginny passed him to enter her classroom, he yelled spitefully after her, \"I don't think Potter liked your valentine much!\"\n\u3000\u3000Ginny covered her face with her hands and ran into class. Snarling, Ron pulled out his wand, too, but Harry pulled him away. Ron didn't need to spend the whole of Charms belching slugs.\n\u3000\u3000It wasn't until they had reached Professor Flitwick's class that Harry noticed something rather odd about Riddle's diary. All his other books were drenched in scarlet ink. The diary, however, was as clean as it had been before the ink bottle had smashed all over it. He tried to point this out to Ron, but Ron was having trouble with his wand again; large purple bubbles were blossoming out of the end, and he wasn't much interested in anything else.\n\u3000\u3000Harry went to bed before anyone else in his dormitory that night. This was partly because he didn't think he could stand Fred and George singing, \"His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad\" one more time, and partly because he wanted to examine Riddle's diary again, and knew that Ron thought he was wasting his time.\n\u3000\u3000Harry sat on his four-poster and flicked through the blank pages, not one of which had a trace of scarlet ink on it. Then he pulled a new bottle out of his bedside cabinet, dipped his quill into it, and dropped a blot onto the first page of the diary.\n\u3000\u3000The ink shone brightly on the paper for a second and then, as though it was being sucked into the page, vanished. Excited, Harry loaded up his quill a second time and wrote, \"My name is Harry Potter.\"\n\u3000\u3000The words shone momentarily on the page and they, too, sank without trace. Then, at last, something happened.\n\u3000\u3000Oozing back out of the page, in his very own ink, came words Harry had never written.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hello, Harry Potter. My name is Tom Riddle. How did you come by my diary?\"\n\u3000\u3000These words, too, faded away, but not before Harry had started to scribble back.\n\u3000\u3000\"Someone tried to flush it down a toilet.\"\n\u3000\u3000He waited eagerly for Riddle's reply.\n\u3000\u3000\"Lucky that I recorded my memories in some more lasting way than ink. But I always knew that there would be those who would not want this diary read. \"\n\u3000\u3000\"What do you mean?\" Harry scrawled, blotting the page in his excitement.\n\u3000\u3000*240*\n\u3000\u3000`I mean that this diary holds memories of terrible things. Things that were covered up. Things that happened at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. \"\n\u3000\u3000\"That's where I am now,\" Harry wrote quickly. \"I'm at Hogwarts, and horrible stuff's been happening. Do you know anything about the Chamber of Secrets?\"\n\u3000\u3000His heart was hammering. Riddle's reply came quickly, his writing becoming untidier, as though he was hurrying to tell all he knew.\n\u3000\u3000\"Of course I know about the Chamber of Secrets. In my day, they told us it was a legend, that it did not exist. But this was a lie. In my fifth year, the Chamber was opened and the monster attacked several students, finally killing one. I caught the person whod opened the Chamber and he was expelled. But the Headmaster, Professor Dippet, ashamed that such a thing had happened at Hogwarts, forbade me to tell the truth. A story was given out that thegirl had died in a freak accident. They gave me a nice, shiny, engraved trophy for my trouble and warned me to keep my mouth shut. But I knew it could happen again. The monster lived on, and the one who had the power to release it was not imprisoned. \"\n\u3000\u3000Harry nearly upset his ink bottle in his hurry to write back.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's happening again now. There have been three attacks and no one seems to know who's behind them. Who was it last time?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I can show you, if you like, \"came Riddle's reply. \"You don't have\n\u3000\u3000to take my word for it. I can take you inside my memory of the night when I caught him. \"\n\u3000\u3000Harry hesitated, his quill suspended over the diary. What did Riddle mean? How could he be taken inside somebody else's memory? He glanced nervously at the door to the dormitory, which was\n\u3000\u3000 *241*\n\u3000\u3000growing dark. When he looked back at the diary, he saw fresh words forming.\n\u3000\u3000\"Let me show you. \"\n\u3000\u3000Harry paused for a fraction of a second and then wrote two letters.\n\u3000\u3000(40K.55\n\u3000\u3000The pages of the diary began to blow as though caught in a high wind, stopping halfway through the month of June. Mouth hanging open, Harry saw that the little square for June thirteenth seemed to have turned into a miniscule television screen. His hands trembling slightly, he raised the book to press his eye against the little window, and before he knew what was happening, he was tilting forward; the window was widening, he felt his body leave his bed, and he was pitched headfirst through the opening in the page, into a whirl of color and shadow.\n\u3000\u3000He felt his feet hit solid ground, and stood, shaking, as the blurred shapes around him came suddenly into focus.\n\u3000\u3000He knew immediately where he was. This circular room with the sleeping portraits was Dumbledore's office - but it wasn't Dumbledore who was sitting behind the desk. A wizened, fraillooking wizard, bald except for a few wisps of white hair, was reading a letter by candlelight. Harry had never seen this man before.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm sorry,\" he said shakily. \"I didn't mean to butt in -\"\n\u3000\u3000But the wizard didn't look up. He continued to read, frowning slightly. Harry drew nearer to his desk and stammered, \"Er - I'll just go, shall I?\"\n\u3000\u3000Still the wizard ignored him. He didn't seem even to have heard him. Thinking that the wizard might be deaf, Harry raised his voice.\n\u3000\u3000*242*\n\u3000\u3000\"Sorry I disturbed you. I'll go now,\" he half-shouted.\n\u3000\u3000The wizard folded up the letter with a sigh, stood up, walked past Harry without glancing at him, and went to draw the curtains at his window.\n\u3000\u3000The sky outside the window was ruby-red; it seemed to be sunset. The wizard went back to the desk, sat down, and twiddled his thumbs, watching the door.\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked around the office. No Fawkes the phoenix - no whirring silver contraptions. This was Hogwarts as Riddle had known it, meaning that this unknown wizard was Headmaster, not Dumbledore, and he, Harry, was little more than a phantom, completely invisible to the people of fifty years ago.\n\u3000\u3000There was a knock on the office door.\n\u3000\u3000\"Enter,\" said the old wizard in a feeble voice.\n\u3000\u3000A boy of about sixteen entered, taking off his pointed hat. A silver prefect's badge was glinting on his chest. He was much taller than Harry, but he, too, had jet-black hair.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah, Riddle,\" said the Headmaster.\n\u3000\u3000\"You wanted to see me, Professor Dippet?\" said Riddle. He looked nervous.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sit down,\" said Dippet. \"I've just been reading the letter you sent me.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh,\" said Riddle. He sat down, gripping his hands together very tightly.\n\u3000\u3000\"My dear boy,\" said Dipper kindly, \"I cannot possibly let you stay at school over the summer. Surely you want to go home for the holidays?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Riddle at once. \"Id much rather stay at Hogwarts than go back to that - to that -\"\n\u3000\u3000* 243*\n\u3000\u3000\"You live in a Muggle orphanage during the holidays, I believe?\" said Dippet curiously.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes, sir,\" said Riddle, reddening slightly.\n\u3000\u3000\"You are Muggle-born?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Half-blood, sir,\" said Riddle. \"Muggle father, witch mother.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"And are both your parents -?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"My mother died just after I was born, sir. They told me at the orphanage she lived just long enough to name me - Tom after my father, Marvolo after my grandfather.\"\n\u3000\u3000Dipper clucked his tongue sympathetically.\n\u3000\u3000\"The thing is, Tom,\" he sighed, \"Special arrangements might have been made for you, but in the current circumstances . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You mean all these attacks, sir?\" said Riddle, and Harry's heart leapt, and he moved closer, scared of missing anything.\n\u3000\u3000\"Precisely,\" said the headmaster. \"My dear boy, you must see how foolish it would be of me to allow you to remain at the castle when term ends. Particularly in light of the recent tragedy ... the death of that poor little girl .... You will be safer by far at your orphanage. As a matter of fact, the Ministry of Magic is even now talking about closing the school. We are no nearer locating the er - source of all this unpleasantness . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000Riddle's eyes had widened.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sir - if the person was caught - if it all stopped -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What do you mean?\" said Dippet with a squeak in his voice, sitting up in his chair. \"Riddle, do you mean you know something about these attacks?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No, sir,\" said Riddle quickly.\n\u3000\u3000But Harry was sure it was the same sort of \"no\" that he himself had given Dumbledore.\n\u3000\u3000*244*\n\u3000\u3000Dippet sank back, looking faintly disappointed.\n\u3000\u3000\"You may go, Tom ......\n\u3000\u3000Riddle slid off his chair and slouched out of the room. Harry followed him.\n\u3000\u3000Down the moving spiral staircase they went, emerging next to the gargoyle in the darkening corridor. Riddle stopped, and so did Harry, watching him. Harry could tell that Riddle was doing some serious thinking. He was biting his lip, his forehead furrowed.\n\u3000\u3000Then, as though he had suddenly reached a decision, he hurried off, Harry gliding noiselessly behind him. They didn't see another person until they reached the entrance hall, when a tall wizard with long, sweeping auburn hair and a beard called to Riddle from the marble staircase.\n\u3000\u3000\"What are you doing, wandering around this late, Tom?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry gaped at the wizard. He was none other than a fifty-year- younger Dumbledore.\n\u3000\u3000\"I had to see the headmaster, sir,\" said Riddle.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, hurry off to bed,\" said Dumbledore, giving Riddle exactly the kind of penetrating stare Harry knew so well. \"Best not to roam the corridors these days. Not since . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000He sighed heavily, bade Riddle good night, and strode off. Riddle watched him walk out of sight and then, moving quickly, headed straight down the stone steps to the dungeons, with Harry in hot pursuit.\n\u3000\u3000But to Harry's disappointment, Riddle led him not into a hidden passageway or a secret tunnel but to the very dungeon in which Harry had Potions with Snape. The torches hadn't been lit, and when Riddle pushed the door almost closed, Harry could only just\n\u3000\u3000*2 45 *\n\u3000\u3000see him, standing stock-still by the door, watching the passage outside.\n\u3000\u3000It felt to Harry that they were there for at least an hour. All he could see was the figure of Riddle at the door, staring through the crack, waiting like a statue. And just when Harry had stopped feeling expectant and tense and started wishing he could return to the present, he heard something move beyond the door.\n\u3000\u3000Someone was creeping along the passage. He heard whoever it was pass the dungeon where he and Riddle were hidden. Riddle, quiet as a shadow, edged through the door and followed, Harry tiptoeing behind him, forgetting that he couldn't be heard.\n\u3000\u3000For perhaps five minutes they followed the footsteps, until Riddle stopped suddenly, his head inclined in the direction of new noises. Harry heard a door creak open, and then someone speaking in a hoarse whisper.\n\u3000\u3000\"C'mon ... gotta get yeh outta here .... C'mon now ... in the box. . .\"\n\u3000\u3000There was something familiar about that voice ....\n\u3000\u3000Riddle suddenly jumped around the corner. Harry stepped out behind him. He could see the dark outline of a huge boy who was crouching in front of an open door, a very large box next to it.\n\u3000\u3000\"Evening, Rubeus,\" said Riddle sharply.\n\u3000\u3000The boy slammed the door shut and stood up.\n\u3000\u3000\"What yer doin' down here, Tom?\"\n\u3000\u3000Riddle stepped closer.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's all over,\" he said. \"I'm going to have to turn you in, Rubeus. They're talking about closing Hogwarts if the attacks don't stop.\"\n\u3000\u30004 6\n\u3000\u3000\"N\" at d'yeh -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't think you meant to kill anyone. But monsters don't make good pets. I suppose you just let it out for exercise and -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It never killed no one!\" said the large boy, backing against the closed door. From behind him, Harry could hear a funny rustling and clicking.\n\u3000\u3000\"Come on, Rubeus,\" said Riddle, moving yet closer. \"The dead girl's parents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do is make sure that the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered ......\n\u3000\u3000\"It wasn't him!\" roared the boy, his voice echoing in the dark passage. \"He wouldn'! He never!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Stand aside,\" said Riddle, drawing out his wand.\n\u3000\u3000His spell lit the corridor with a sudden flaming light. The door behind the large boy flew open with such force it knocked him into the wall opposite. And out of it came something that made Harry let out a long, piercing scream unheard by anyone\n\u3000\u3000A vast, low-slung, hairy body and a tangle of black legs; a gleam of many eyes and a pair of razor-sharp pincers - Riddle raised his wand again, but he was too late. The thing bowled him over as it scuttled away, tearing up the corridor and out of sight. Riddle scrambled to his feet, looking after it; he raised his wand, but the huge boy leapt on him, seized his wand, and threw him back down, yelling, \"NO000000!\"\n\u3000\u3000The scene whirled, the darkness became complete; Harry felt himself falling and, with a crash, he landed spread-eagled on his four-poster in the Gryffindor dormitory, Riddle's diary lying open on his stomach.\n\u3000\u3000*24 7*\n\u3000\u3000Before he had had time to regain his breath, the dormitory door opened and Ron came in.\n\u3000\u3000\"There you are,\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000Harry sat up. He was sweating and shaking.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's up?\" said Ron, looking at him with concern.\n\u3000\u3000\"It was Hagrid, Ron. Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty years ago.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry, Ron, and Hermione had always known that Hagrid had an unfortunate liking for large and monstrous creatures. During their first year at Hogwarts he had tried to raise a dragon in his little wooden house, and it would be a long time before they forgot the giant, three- headed dog he'd christened \"Fluffy.\" And if, as a boy, Hagrid had heard that a monster was hidden somewhere in the castle, Harry was sure he'd have gone to any lengths for a glimpse of it. He'd probably thought it was a shame that the monster had been cooped up so long, and thought it deserved the chance to stretch its many legs; Harry could just imagine the thirteen-year-old Hagrid trying to fit a leash and collar on it. But he was equally certain that Hagrid would never have meant to kill anybody.\n\u3000\u3000Harry half wished he hadn't found out how to work Riddle's diary. Again and again Ron and Hermione made him recount what\n\u3000\u3000he'd seen, until he was heartily sick of telling them and sick of the long, circular conversations that followed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Riddle might have got the wrong person,\" said Hermione. \"Maybe it was some other monster that was attacking people . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"How many monsters d'you think this place can hold?\" Ron asked dully.\n\u3000\u3000\"We always knew Hagrid had been expelled,\" said Harry miserably. \"And the attacks must've stopped after Hagrid was kicked out. Otherwise, Riddle wouldn't have got his award.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron tried a different tack.\n\u3000\u3000\"Riddle does sound like Percy - who asked him to squeal on Hagrid, anyway?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But the monster had killed someone, Ron,\" said Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"And Riddle was going to go back to some Muggle orphanage if they closed Hogwarts,\" said Harry. \"I don't blame him for wanting to stay here ......\n\u3000\u3000\"You met Hagrid down Knockturn Alley, didn't you, Harry?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He was buying a Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent,\" said Harry quickly.\n\u3000\u3000The three of them fell silent. After a long pause, Hermione voiced the knottiest question of all in a hesitant voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"Do you think we should go and ask Hagrid about it all?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That'd be a cheerful visit,\" said Ron. \"'Hello, Hagrid. Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?\"'\n\u3000\u3000In the end, they decided that they would not say anything to Hagrid unless there was another attack, and as more and more days went by with no whisper from the disembodied voice, they became\n\u3000\u3000hopeful that they would never need to talk to him about why he had been expelled. It was now nearly four months since Justin and Nearly Headless Nick had been Petrified, and nearly everybody seemed to think that the attacker, whoever it was, had retired for good. Peeves had finally got bored of his \"Oh, Potter, you rotter\" song, Ernie Macmillan asked Harry quite politely to pass a bucket of leaping toadstools in Herbology one day, and in March several of the Mandrakes threw a loud and raucous party in greenhouse three. This made Professor Sprout very happy.\n\u3000\u3000\"The moment they start trying to move into each other's pots, we'll know they're fully mature,\" she told Harry. \"Then we'll be able to revive those poor people in the hospital wing.\"\n\u3000\u3000The second years were given something new to think about during their Easter holidays. The time had come to choose their subjects for the third year, a matter that Hermione, at least, took very seriously.\n\u3000\u3000\"it could affect our whole future,\" she told Harry and Ron as they pored over lists of new subjects, marking them with checks.\n\u3000\u3000\"I just want to give up Potions,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"We can't,\" said Ron gloomily. \"We keep all our old subjects, or I'd've ditched Defense Against the Dark Arts.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But that's very important!\" said Hermione, shocked.\n\u3000\u3000\"Not the way Lockhart teaches it,\" said Ron. \"I haven't learned anything from him except not to set pixies loose.\"\n\u3000\u3000Neville Longbottom had been sent letters from all the witches and wizards in his family, all giving him different advice on what to choose. Confused and worried, he sat reading the subject lists with\n\u3000\u3000his tongue poking out, asking people whether they thought Arithmancy sounded more difficult than the study of Ancient Runes. Dean Thomas, who, like Harry, had grown up with Muggles, ended up closing his eyes and jabbing his wand at the list, then picking the subjects it landed on. Hermione took nobody's advice but signed up for everything.\n\u3000\u3000Harry smiled grimly to himself at the thought of what Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia would say if he tried to discuss his career in wizardry with them. Not that he didn't get any guidance: Percy Weasley was eager to share his experience.\n\u3000\u3000\"Depends where you want to go, Harry,\" he said. \"It's never too early to think about the future, so Id recommend Divination. People say Muggle Studies is a soft option, but I personally think wizards should have a thorough understanding of the non-magical community, particularly if they're thinking of working in close contact with them - look at my father, he has to deal with Muggle business all the time. My brother Charlie was always more of an outdoor type, so he went for Care of Magical Creatures. Play to your strengths, Harry.\"\n\u3000\u3000But the only thing Harry felt he was really good at was Quidditch. In the end, he chose the same new subjects as Ron, feeling that if he was lousy at them, at least he'd have someone friendly to help him.\n\u3000\u3000Gryffindor's next Quidditch match would be against Hufflepuff. Wood was insisting on team practices every night after dinner, so that Harry barely had time for anything but Quidditch and homework. However, the training sessions were getting better, or at least\n\u3000\u3000drier, and the evening before Saturday's match he went up to his dormitory to drop off his broomstick feeling Gryffindor's chances for the Quidditch cup had never been better.\n\u3000\u3000But his cheerful mood didn't last long. At the top of the stairs to the dormitory, he met Neville Longbottom, who was looking frantic.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry - I don't know who did it - I just found -\"\n\u3000\u3000Watching Harry fearfully, Neville pushed open the door.\n\u3000\u3000The contents of Harry's trunk had been thrown everywhere. His cloak lay ripped on the floor. The bedclothes had been pulled off his four-poster and the drawer had been pulled out of his bedside cabinet, the contents strewn over the mattress.\n\u3000\u3000Harry walked over to the bed, open-mouthed, treading on a few loose pages of Travels with Trolls. As he and Neville pulled the blankets back onto his bed, Ron, Dean, and Seamus came in. Dean swore loudly.\n\u3000\u3000\"What happened, Harry?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No idea,\" said Harry. But Ron was examining Harry's robes. All the pockets were hanging out.\n\u3000\u3000\"Someone's been looking for something,\" said Ron. \"Is there anything missing?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry started to pick up all his things and throw them into his trunk. It was only as he threw the last of the Lockhart books back into it that he realized what wasn't there.\n\u3000\u3000\"Riddle's diary's gone,\" he said in an undertone to Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry jerked his head toward the dormitory door and Ron followed him out. They hurried down to the Gryffindor common\n\u3000\u3000room, which was half-empty, and joined Hermione, who was sitting alone, reading a book called Ancient Runes Made Easy.\n\u3000\u3000Hermione looked aghast at the news.\n\u3000\u3000\"But - only a Gryffindor could have stolen - nobody else knows our password -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Exactly,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000They woke the next day to brilliant sunshine and a light, refreshing breeze.\n\u3000\u3000\"Perfect Quidditch conditions!\" said Wood enthusiastically at the Gryffindor table, loading the team's plates with scrambled eggs. \"Harry, buck up there, you need a decent breakfast.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry had been staring down the packed Gryffindor table, wondering if the new owner of Riddle's diary was right in front of his eyes. Hermione had been urging him to report the robbery, but Harry didn't like the idea. He'd have to tell a teacher all about the diary, and how many people knew why Hagrid had been expelled fifty years ago? He didn't want to be the one who brought it all up again.\n\u3000\u3000As he left the Great Hall with Ron and Hermione to go and collect his Quidditch things, another very serious worry was added to Harry's growing list. He had just set foot on the marble staircase when he heard it yet again\n\u3000\u3000\"Kill this time ... let me rip ... tear. . .\"\n\u3000\u3000He shouted aloud and Ron and Hermione both jumped away from him in alarm.\n\u3000\u3000\"The voice!\" said Harry, -looking over his shoulder. \"I just heard it again - didn't you?\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron shook his head, wide-eyed. Hermione, however, clapped a hand to her forehead.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry - I think I've just understood something! I've got to go to the library!\"\n\u3000\u3000And she sprinted away, up the stairs.\n\u3000\u3000\"What does she understand?\" said Harry distractedly, still looking around, trying to tell where the voice had come from.\n\u3000\u3000\"Loads more than I do,\" said Ron, shaking his head.\n\u3000\u3000\"But why's she got to go to the library?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Because that's what Hermione does,\" said Ron, shrugging. \"When in doubt, go to the library.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry stood, irresolute, trying to catch the voice again, but people were now emerging from the Great Hall behind him, talking loudly, exiting through the front doors on their way to the Quidditch pitch.\n\u3000\u3000\"You'd better get moving,\" said Ron. \"It's nearly eleven - the match - \"\n\u3000\u3000Harry raced up to Gryffindor Tower, collected his Nimbus Two Thousand, and joined the large crowd swarming across the grounds, but his mind was still in the castle along with the bodiless voice, and as he pulled on his scarlet robes in the locker. room, his only comfort was that everyone was now outside to watch the game.\n\u3000\u3000The teams walked onto the field to tumultuous applause. Oliver Wood took off for a warm-up flight around the goal posts; Madam Hooch released the balls. The Hufflepuffs, who played in canary yellow, were standing in a huddle, having a last-minute discussion of tactics.\n\u3000\u3000Harry was just mounting his broom when Professor McGonagall came half marching, half running across the pitch, carrying an enormous purple megaphone.\n\u3000\u3000Harry's heart dropped like a stone.\n\u3000\u3000\"This match has been cancelled,\" Professor McGonagall called through the megaphone, addressing the packed stadium. There were boos and shouts. Oliver Wood, looking devastated, landed and ran toward Professor McGonagall without getting off his broomstick.\n\u3000\u3000\"But, Professor!\" he shouted. \"We've got to play - the cup\n\u3000\u3000Gryffindor -\"\n\u3000\u3000Professor McGonagall ignored him and continued to shout through her megaphone:\n\u3000\u3000\"All students are to make their way back to the House common rooms, where their Heads of Houses will give them further information. As quickly as you can, please!\"\n\u3000\u3000Then she lowered the megaphone and beckoned Harry over to her.\n\u3000\u3000\"Potter, I think you'd better come with me ......\n\u3000\u3000Wondering how she could possibly suspect him this time, Harry saw Ron detach himself from the complaining crowd; he came running up to them as they set off toward the castle. To Harry's surprise, Professor McGonagall didn't object.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes, perhaps you'd better come, too, Weasley .....\n\u3000\u3000Some of the students swarming around them were grumbling about the match being canceled; others looked worried. Harry and Ron followed Professor McGonagall back into the school and up the marble staircase. But they weren't taken to anybody's office this time.\n\u3000\u3000\"This will be a bit of a shock,\" said Professor McGonagall in a surprisingly gentle voice as they approached the infirmary. \"There has been another attack ... another double attack.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry's insides did a horrible somersault. Professor McGonagall pushed the door open and he and Ron entered. .\n\u3000\u3000Madam Pomfrey was bending over a fifth-year girl with long, curly hair. Harry recognized her as the Ravenclaw they'd accidentally asked for directions to the Slytherin common room. And on the bed next to her was\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione!\" Ron groaned.\n\u3000\u3000Hermione lay utterly still, her eyes open and glassy.\n\u3000\u3000\"They were found near the library,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"I don't suppose either of you can explain this? It was on the floor next to them ......\n\u3000\u3000She was holding up a small, circular mirror.\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron shook their heads, both staring at Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"I will escort you back to Gryffindor Tower,\" said Professor McGonagall heavily. \"I need to address the students in any case.\n\u3000\u3000\"All students will return to their House common rooms by six o'clock in the evening. No student is to leave the dormitories after that time. You will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher. No student is to use the bathroom unaccompanied by a teacher. All further Quidditch training and matches are to be postponed. There will be no more evening activities.\"\n\u3000\u3000The Gryffindors packed inside the common room listened to Professor McGonagall in silence. She rolled up the parchment\n\u3000\u3000from which she had been reading and said in a somewhat choked voice, \"I need hardly add that I have rarely been so distressed. It is likely that the school will be closed unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught. I would urge anyone who thinks they might know anything about them to come forward.\"\n\u3000\u3000She climbed somewhat awkwardly out of the portrait hole, and the Gryffindors began talking immediately.\n\u3000\u3000\"That's two Gryffindors down, not counting a Gryffindor ghost, one Ravenclaw, and one Hufflepuff, \" said the Weasley twins' friend Lee Jordan, counting on his fingers. \"Haven't any of the teachers noticed that the Slytherins are all safe? Isn't it obvious all this stuff's coming from Slytherin? The Heir of Slytherin, the monster of Slytherin - why don't they just chuck all the Slytherins out?\" he roared, to nods and scattered applause.\n\u3000\u3000Percy Weasley was sitting in a chair behind Lee, but for once he didn't seem keen to make his views heard. He was looking pale and stunned.\n\u3000\u3000\"Percy's in shock,\" George told Harry quietly. \"That Ravenclaw girl - Penelope Clearwater - she's a prefect. I don't think he thought the monster would dare attack a prefect.\"\n\u3000\u3000But Harry was only half-listening. He didn't seem to be able to get rid of the picture of Hermione, lying on the hospital bed as though carved out of stone. And if the culprit wasn't caught soon, he was looking at a lifetime back with the Dursleys. Tom Riddle had turned Hagrid in because he was faced with the prospect of a Muggle orphanage if the school closed. Harry now knew exactly how he had felt.\n\u3000\u3000\"What're we going to do?\" said Ron quietly in Harry's ear. \"D'you think they suspect Hagrid?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We've got to go and talk to him,\" said Harry, making up his mind. \"I can't believe it's him this time, but if he set the monster loose last time he'll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets, and that's a start.\" \"But McGonagall said we've got to stay in our tower unless we're in class -\" \"I think,\" said Harry, more quietly still, \"it's time to get my dad's old cloak out again.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry had inherited) ust one thing from his father: a long and sil very Invisibility Cloak. It was their only chance of sneaking out of the school to visit Hagrid without anyone knowing about it. They went to bed at the usual time, waited until Neville, Dean, and Sea mus had stopped discussing the Chamber of Secrets and finally fallen asleep, then got up, dressed again, and threw the cloak over themselves. The journey through the dark and deserted castle corridors wasn't enjoyable. Harry, who had wandered the castle at night sev eral times before, had never seen it so crowded after sunset. Teach ers, prefects, and ghosts were marching the corridors in pairs, staring around for any unusual activity. Their Invisibility Cloak didn't stop them making any noise, and there was a particularly tense moment when Ron stubbed his toe only yards from the spot where Snape stood standing guard. Thankfully, Snape sneezed at almost exactly the moment Ron swore. It was with relief that they reached the oak front doors and eased them open. It was a clear, starry night. They hurried toward the lit windows of Hagrid's house and pulled off the cloak only when they were right outside his front door.\n\u3000\u3000Seconds after they had knocked, Hagrid flung it open. They found themselves face-to-face with him aiming a crossbow at them. Fang the boarhound barked loudly behind him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh,\" he said, lowering the weapon and staring at them. \"What're you two doin' here?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What's that for?\" said Harry, pointing at the crossbow as they stepped inside.\n\u3000\u3000\"Nothin' - nothin' - \" Hagrid muttered. \"I've bin expectin' doesn' matter - Sit down - I'll make tea -\"\n\u3000\u3000He hardly seemed to know what he was doing. He nearly extinguished the fire, spilling water from the kettle on it, and then smashed the teapot with a nervous jerk of his massive hand.\n\u3000\u3000\"Are you okay, Hagrid?\" said Harry. \"Did you hear about Hermione?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, I heard, all righ',\" said Hagrid, a slight break in his voice.\n\u3000\u3000He kept glancing nervously at the windows. He poured them both large mugs of boiling water (he had forgotten to add tea bags) and was just putting a slab of fruitcake on a plate when there was a loud knock on the door.\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid dropped the fruitcake. Harry and Ron exchanged panicstricken looks, then threw the Invisibility Cloak back over themselves and retreated into a corner. Hagrid checked that they were hidden, seized his crossbow, and flung open his door once more.\n\u3000\u3000\"Good evening, Hagrid.\"\n\u3000\u3000It was Dumbledore. He entered, looking deadly serious, and was followed by a second, very odd-looking man.\n\u3000\u3000The stranger had rumpled gray hair and an anxious expression, and was wearing a strange mixture of clothes: a pinstriped suit, a\n\u3000\u3000scarlet tie, a long black cloak, and pointed purple boots. Under his arm he carried a lime-green bowler.\n\u3000\u3000\"That's Dad's boss!\" Ron breathed. \"Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry elbowed Ron hard to make him shut up.\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid had gone pale and sweaty. He dropped into one of his chairs and looked from Dumbledore to Cornelius Fudge.\n\u3000\u3000\"Bad business, Hagrid,\" said Fudge in rather clipped tones. \"Very bad business. Had to come. Four attacks on Muggle-borns. Things've gone far enough. Ministry's got to act.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I never,\" said Hagrid, looking imploringly at Dumbledore. \"You know I never, Professor Dumbledore, sir -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confidence,\" said Dumbledore, frowning at Fudge.\n\u3000\u3000\"Look, Albus,\" said Fudge, uncomfortably. \"Hagrid's record's against him. Ministry's got to do something - the school governors have been in touch -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yet again, Cornelius, I tell you that taking Hagrid away will not help in the slightest,\" said Dumbledore. His blue eyes were full of a fire Harry had never seen before.\n\u3000\u3000\"Look at it from my point of view,\" said Fudge, fidgeting with his bowler. \"I'm under a lot of pressure. Got to be seen to be doing something. If it turns out it wasn't Hagrid, he'll be back and no more said. But I've got to take him. Got to. Wouldn't be doing my duty -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Take me?\" said Hagrid, who was trembling. \"Take me where?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"For a short stretch only,\" said Fudge, not meeting Hagrid's eyes. \"Not a punishment, Hagrid, more a precaution. If someone else is caught, you'll be let out with a full apology -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Not Azkaban?\" croaked Hagrid.\n\u3000\u3000Before Fudge could answer, there was another loud rap on the door.\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore answered it. It was Harry's turn for an elbow in the ribs; he'd let out an audible gasp.\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Lucius Malfoy strode into Hagrid's hut, swathed in a long black traveling cloak, smiling a cold and satisfied smile. Fang started to growl.\n\u3000\u3000\"Already here, Fudge,\" he said approvingly. \"Good, good. . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What're you doin' here?\" said Hagrid furiously. \"Get outta my house!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"My dear man, please believe me, I have no pleasure at all in being inside your - er - d'you call this a house?\" said Lucius Malfoy, sneering as he looked around the small cabin. \"I simply called at the school and was told that the headmaster was here.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"And what exactly did you want with me, Lucius?\" said Dumbledore. He spoke politely, but the fire was still blazing in his blue eyes.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dreadful thing, Dumbledore,\" said Malfoy lazily, taking out a long roll of parchment, \"but the governors feel it's time for you to step aside. This is an Order of Suspension - you'll find all twelve signatures on it. I'm afraid we feel you're losing your touch. How many attacks have there been now? Two more this afternoon, wasn't it? At this rate, there'll be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts, and we all know what an awful loss that would be to the school.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, now, see here, Lucius,\" said Fudge, looking alarmed, \"Dumbledore suspended - no, no - last thing we want just now\n\u3000\u3000262\n\u3000\u3000\"The appointment - or suspension - of the headmaster is a matter for the governors, Fudge,\" said Mr. Malfoy smoothly. \"And as Dumbledore has failed to stop these attacks -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"See here, Malfoy, if Dumbledore can't stop them,\" said Fudge, whose upper lip was sweating now, \"I mean to say, who can?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That remains to be seen,\" said Mr. Malfoy with a nasty smile. \"But as all twelve of us have voted -\"\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid leapt to his feet, his shaggy black head grazing the ceiling.\n\u3000\u3000'An' how many did yeh have ter threaten an' blackmail before they agreed, Malfoy, eh?\" he roared.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dear, dear, you know, that temper of yours will lead you into trouble one of these days, Hagrid,\" said Mr. Malfoy. \"I would advise you not to shout at the Azkaban guards like that. They won't like it at all.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeh can' take Dumbledore!\" yelled Hagrid, making Fang the boarhound cower and whimper in his basket. \"Take him away, an' the Muggle-borns won' stand a chance! There'll be killin' next!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Calm yourself, Hagrid,\" said Dumbledore sharply. He looked at Lucius Malfoy.\n\u3000\u3000\"If the governors want my removal, Lucius, I shall of course step aside -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But -\" stuttered Fudge.\n\u3000\u3000\"No!\"growled Hagrid.\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore had not taken his bright blue eyes off Lucius Malfoy's cold gray ones.\n\u3000\u3000\"However,\" said Dumbledore, speaking very slowly and clearly so that none of them could miss a word, \"you will find that I will\n\u3000\u3000* 26$*\n\u3000\u3000ummer was creeping over the grounds around the castle; sky and lake alike turned periwinkle blue and flowers large as cabbages burst into bloom in the greenhouses. But with no Hagrid visible from the castle windows, striding the grounds with Fang at his heels, the scene didn't look right to Harry; no better, in fact, than the inside of the castle, where things were so horribly wrong.\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron had tried to visit Hermione, but visitors were now barred from the hospital wing.\n\u3000\u3000\"We're taking no more chances,\" Madam Pomfrey told them severely through a crack in the infirmary door. \"No, I'm sorry, there's every chance the attacker might come back to finish these people off . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000With Dumbledore gone, fear had spread as never before, so that the sun warming the castle walls outside seemed to stop at the mullioned windows. There was barely a face to be seen in the school\n\u3000\u3000* 265*\n\u3000\u3000that didn't look worried and tense, and any laughter that rang through the corridors sounded shrill and unnatural and was quickly stifled.\n\u3000\u3000Harry constantly repeated Dumbledore's final words to himself \"I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me... Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.\" But what good were these words? Who exactly were they supposed to ask for help, when everyone was just as confused and scared as they were?\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid's hint about the spiders was far easier to understand the trouble was, there didn't seem to be a single spider left in the castle to follow. Harry looked everywhere he went, helped (rather reluctantly) by Ron. They were hampered, of course, by the fact that they weren't allowed to wander off on their own but had to move around the castle in a pack with the other Gryffindors. Most of their fellow students seemed glad that they were being shepherded from class to class by teachers, but Harry found it very irksome.\n\u3000\u3000One person, however, seemed to be thoroughly enjoying the atmosphere of terror and suspicion. Draco Malfoy was strutting around the school as though he had just been appointed Head Boy. Harry didn't realize what he was so pleased about until the Potions lesson about two weeks after Dumbledore and Hagrid had left, when, sitting right behind Malfoy, Harry overheard him gloating to Crabbe and Goyle.\n\u3000\u3000\"I always thought Father might be the one who got rid of Dumbledore,\" he said, not troubling to keep his voice down. \"I told you he thinks Dumbledore's the worst headmaster the school's ever\n\u3000\u3000*266*\n\u3000\u3000had. Maybe we'll get a decent headmaster now. Someone who won't want the Chamber of Secrets closed. McGonagall won't last long, she's only filling in ......\n\u3000\u3000Snape swept past Harry, making no comment about Hermione's empty seat and cauldron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sir,\" said Malfoy loudly. \"Sir, why don't you apply for the headmaster's job?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Now, now, Malfoy,\" said Snape, though he couldn't suppress a thin- lipped smile. \"Professor Dumbledore has only been suspended by the governors. I daresay he'll be back with us soon enough.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, right,\" said Malfoy, smirking. \"I expect you'd have Father's vote, sir, if you wanted to apply for the job - I'll tell Father you're the best teacher here, sir -\"\n\u3000\u3000Snape smirked as he swept off around the dungeon, fortunately not spotting Seamus Finnigan, who was pretending to vomit into his cauldron.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm quite surprised the Mudbloods haven't all packed their bags by now,\" Malfoy went on. \"Bet you five Galleons the next one dies. Pity it wasn't Granger -\"\n\u3000\u3000The bell rang at that moment, which was lucky; at Malfoy's last words, Ron had leapt off his stool, and in the scramble to collect bags and books, his attempts to reach Malfoy went unnoticed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Let me at him,\" Ron growled as Harry and Dean hung onto his arms. \"I don't care, I don't need my wand, I'm going to kill him with my bare hands -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hurry up, I've got to take you all to Herbology,\" barked Snape over the class's heads, and off they marched, with Harry, Ron, and Dean bringing up the rear, Ron still trying to get loose. It was only\n\u3000\u3000* 261*\n\u3000\u3000safe to let go of him when Snape had seen them out of the castle and they were making their way across the vegetable patch toward the greenhouses.\n\u3000\u3000The Herbology class was very subdued; there were now two missing from their number, Justin and Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000Professor Sprout set them all to work pruning the Abyssinian Shrivelfigs. Harry went to tip an armful of withered stalks onto the compost heap and found himself face-to-face with Ernie Macmillan. Ernie took a deep breath and said, very formally, \"I just want to say, Harry, that I'm sorry I ever suspected you. I know you'd never attack Hermione Granger, and I apologize for all the stuff I said. We're all in the same boat now, and, well -\"\n\u3000\u3000He held out a pudgy hand, and Harry shook it.\n\u3000\u3000Ernie and his friend Hannah came to work at the same Shrivelfig as Harry and Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"That Draco Malfoy character,\" said Ernie, breaking off dead twigs, \"he seems very pleased about all this, doesn't he? D'you know, I think he might be Slytherin's heir.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That's clever of you,\" said Ron, who didn't seem to have forgiven Ernie as readily as Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Do you think it's Malfoy, Harry?\" Ernie asked.\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Harry, so firmly that Ernie and Hannah stared.\n\u3000\u3000A second later, Harry spotted something.\n\u3000\u3000Several large spiders were scuttling over the ground on the other side of the glass, moving in an unnaturally straight line as though taking the shortest route to a prearranged meeting. Harry hit Ron over the hand with his pruning shears.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ouch! What're you -\"\n\u3000\u3000268\n\u3000\u3000Harry pointed out the spiders, following their progress with his eyes screwed up against the sun.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, yeah,\" said Ron, trying, and failing, to look pleased. \"But we can't follow them now -\"\n\u3000\u3000Ernie and Hannah were listening curiously.\n\u3000\u3000Harry's eyes narrowed as he focused on the spiders. If they pursued their fixed course, there could be no doubt about where they would end up.\n\u3000\u3000\"Looks like they're heading for the Forbidden Forest . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000And Ron looked even unhappier about that.\n\u3000\u3000At the end of the lesson Professor Sprout escorted the class to their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson. Harry and Ron lagged behind the others so they could talk out of earshot.\n\u3000\u3000\"We'll have to use the Invisibility Cloak again,\" Harry told Ron. \"We can take Fang with us. He's used to going into the forest with Hagrid, he might be some help.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Right,\" said Ron, who was twirling his wand nervously in his fingers. \"Er - aren't there - aren't there supposed to be werewolves in the forest?\" he added as they took their usual places at the back of Lockhart's classroom.\n\u3000\u3000Preferring not to answer that question, Harry said, \"There are good things in there, too. The centaurs are all right, and the unicorns ...\n\u3000\u3000Ron had never been into the Forbidden Forest before. Harry had entered it only once and had hoped never to do so again.\n\u3000\u3000Lockhart bounded into the room and the class stared at him. Every other teacher in the place was looking grimmer than usual, but Lockhart appeared nothing short of buoyant.\n\u3000\u30002 69\n\u3000\u3000\"Come now,\" he cried, beaming around him. \"Why all these long faces?\"\n\u3000\u3000People swapped exasperated looks, but nobody answered.\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't you people realize,\" said Lockhart, speaking slowly, as though they were all a bit dim, \"the danger has passed! The culprit has been taken away -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Says who?\" said Dean Thomas loudly.\n\u3000\u3000\"My dear young man, the Minister of Magic wouldn't have taken Hagrid if he hadn't been one hundred percent sure that he was guilty,\" said Lockhart, in the tone of someone explaining that one and one made two.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, yes he would,\" said Ron, even more loudly than Dean.\n\u3000\u3000\"I flatter myself I know a touch more about Hagrid's arrest than you do, Mr. Weasley,\" said Lockhart in a self-satisfied tone.\n\u3000\u3000Ron started to say that he didn't think so, somehow, but stopped in midsentence when Harry kicked him hard under the desk.\n\u3000\u3000\"We weren't there, remember?\" Harry muttered.\n\u3000\u3000But Lockhart's disgusting cheeriness, his hints that he had always thought Hagrid was no good, his confidence that the whole business was now at an end, irritated Harry so much that he yearned to throw Gadding with Ghouls right in Lockhart's stupid face. Instead he contented himself with scrawling a note to Ron: Let's do it tonight.\n\u3000\u3000Ron read the message, swallowed hard, and looked sideways at the empty seat usually filled by Hermione. The sight seemed to stiffen his resolve, and he nodded.\n\u3000\u3000The Gryffindor common room was always very crowded these days, because from six o'clock onward the Gryffindors had no -\n\u3000\u3000*270*\n\u3000\u3000where else to go. They also had plenty to talk about, with the result that the common room often didn't empty until past midnight.\n\u3000\u3000Harry went to get the Invisibility Cloak out of his trunk right after dinner, and spent the evening sitting on it, waiting for the room to clear. Fred and George challenged Harry and Ron to a few games of Exploding Snap, and Ginny sat watching them, very subdued in Hermione's usual chair. Harry and Ron kept losing on purpose, trying to finish the games quickly, but even so, it was well past midnight when Fred, George, and Ginny finally went to bed.\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron waited for the distant sounds of two dormitory doors closing before seizing the cloak, throwing it over themselves, and climbing through the portrait hole.\n\u3000\u3000It was another difficult journey through the castle, dodging all the teachers. At last they reached the entrance hall, slid back the lock on the oak front doors, squeezed between them, trying to stop any creaking, and stepped out into the moonlit grounds.\n\u3000\u3000\"'Course,\" said Ron abruptly as they strode across the black grass, \"we might get to the forest and find there's nothing to follow. Those spiders might not've been going there at all. I know it looked like they were moving in that sort of general direction, but. . .\"\n\u3000\u3000His voice trailed away hopefully.\n\u3000\u3000They reached Hagrid's house, sad and sorry-looking with its blank windows. When Harry pushed the door open, Fang went mad with joy at the sight of them. Worried he might wake everyone at the castle with his deep, booming barks, they hastily fed him treacle fudge from a tin on the mantelpiece, which glued his teeth together.\n\u3000\u3000Harry left the Invisibility Cloak on Hagrid's table. There would be no need for it in the pitch-dark forest.\n\u3000\u3000* 21:L *\n\u3000\u3000\"C'mon, Fang, we're going for a walk,\" said Harry, patting his leg, and Fang bounded happily out of the house behind them, dashed to the edge of the forest, and lifted his leg against a large sycamore tree.\n\u3000\u3000Harry took out his wand, murmured, \"Lumos!\" and a tiny light appeared at the end of it, just enough to let them watch the path for signs of spiders.\n\u3000\u3000\"Good thinking,\" said Ron. \"Id light mine, too, but you know - it'd probably blow up or something ......\n\u3000\u3000Harry tapped Ron on the shoulder, pointing at the grass. Two solitary spiders were hurrying away from the wandlight into the shade of the trees.\n\u3000\u3000\"Okay,\" Ron sighed as though resigned to the worst, \"I'm ready. Let's go.\"\n\u3000\u3000So, with Fang scampering around them, sniffing tree roots and leaves, they entered the forest. By the glow of Harry's wand, they followed the steady trickle of spiders moving along the path. They walked behind them for about twenty minutes, not speaking, listening hard for noises other than breaking twigs and rustling leaves. Then, when the trees had become thicker than ever, so that the stars overhead were no longer visible, and Harry's wand shone alone in the sea of dark, they saw their spider guides leaving the path.\n\u3000\u3000Harry paused, trying to see where the spiders were going, but everything outside his little sphere of *light was pitch-black. He had never been this deep into the forest before. He could vividly remember Hagrid advising him not to leave the forest path last time he'd been in here. But Hagrid was miles away now, probably sitting in a cell in Azkaban, and he had also said to follow the spiders.\n\u3000\u3000* 2-V2 *\n\u3000\u3000Something wet touched Harry's hand and he jumped backward, crushing Rods foot, but it was only Fang's nose.\n\u3000\u3000\"What d'you reckon?\" Harry said to Ron, whose eyes he could just make out, reflecting the light from his wand.\n\u3000\u3000\"We've come this far,\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000So they followed the darting shadows of the spiders into the trees. They couldn't move very quickly now; there were tree roots and stumps in their way, barely visible in the near blackness. Harry could feel Fang's hot breath on his hand. More than once, they had to stop, so that Harry could crouch down and find the spiders in the wandlight.\n\u3000\u3000They walked for what seemed like at least half an hour, their robes snagging on low-slung branches and brambles. After a while, they noticed that the ground seemed to be sloping downward, though the trees were as thick as ever.\n\u3000\u3000Then Fang suddenly let loose a great, echoing bark, making both Harry and Ron jump out of their skins.\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" said Ron loudly, looking around into the pitch-dark, and gripping Harry's elbow very hard.\n\u3000\u3000\"There's something moving over there,\" Harry breathed. \"Listen ... sounds like something big ......\n\u3000\u3000They listened. Some distance to their right, the something big was snapping branches as it carved a path through the trees.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, no,\" said Ron. \"Oh, no, oh, no, oh -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Shut up,\" said Harry frantically. \"It'll hear you.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hear me?\" said Ron in an unnaturally high voice. \"It's already heard Fang!\"\n\u3000\u3000The darkness seemed to be pressing on their eyeballs as they\n\u3000\u3000* 273*\n\u3000\u3000stood, terrified, waiting. There was a strange rumbling noise and then silence.\n\u3000\u3000\"What d'you think it's doing?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Probably getting ready to pounce,\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000They waited, shivering, hardly daring to move.\n\u3000\u3000\"D'you think it's gone?\" Harry whispered.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dunno -\"\n\u3000\u3000Then, to their right, came a sudden blaze of light, so bright in the darkness that both of them flung up their hands to shield their eyes. Fang yelped and tried to run, but got lodged in a tangle of thorns and yelped even louder.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry!\" Ron shouted, his voice breaking with relief \"Harry, it's our car!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Come on!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry blundered after Ron toward the light, stumbling and tripping, and a moment later they had emerged into a clearing.\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Weasley's car was standing, empty, in the middle of a circle of thick trees under a roof of dense branches, its headlights ablaze. As Ron walked, open-mouthed, toward it, it moved slowly toward him, exactly like a large, turquoise dog greeting its owner.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's been here all the time!\" said Ron delightedly, walking around the car. \"Look at it. The forest's turned it wild . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000The sides of the car were scratched and smeared with mud. Apparently it had taken to trundling around the forest on its own. Fang didn't seem at all keen on it; he kept close to Harry, who could feel him quivering. His breathing slowing down again, Harry stuffed his wand back into his robes.\n\u3000\u3000*214*\n\u3000\u3000\"And we thought it was going to attack us!\" said Ron, leaning against the car and patting it. \"I wondered where it had gone!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry squinted around on the floodlit ground for signs of more spiders, but they had all scuttled away from the glare of the headlights.\n\u3000\u3000\"We've lost the trail,\" he said. \"C'mon, let's go and find them.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron didn't speak. He didn't move. His eyes were fixed on a point some ten feet above the forest floor, right behind Harry. His face was livid with terror.\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't even have time to turn around. There was a loud clicking noise and suddenly he felt something long and hairy seize him around the middle and lift him off the ground, so that he was hanging facedown. Struggling, terrified, he heard more clicking, and saw Ron's legs leave the ground, too, heard Fang whimpering and howling - next moment, he was being swept away into the dark trees.\n\u3000\u3000Head hanging, Harry saw that what had hold of him was marching on six immensely long, hairy legs, the front two clutching him tightly below a pair of shining black pincers. Behind him, he could hear another of the creatures, no doubt carrying Ron. They were moving into the very heart of the forest. Harry could hear Fang fighting to free himself from a third monster, whining loudly, but Harry couldn't have yelled even if he had wanted to; he seemed to have left his voice back with the car in the clearing.\n\u3000\u3000He never knew how long he was in the creature's clutches; he only knew that the darkness suddenly lifted enough for him to see that the leaf-strewn ground was now swarming with spiders. Craning his neck sideways, he realized that they had reached the ridge of\n\u3000\u3000*21$*\n\u3000\u3000a vast hollow, a hollow that had been cleared of trees, so that the stars shone brightly onto the worst scene he had ever laid eyes on.\n\u3000\u3000Spiders. Not tiny spiders like those surging over the leaves below. Spiders the size of carthorses, eight-eyed, eight-legged, black, hairy, gigantic. The massive specimen that was carrying Harry made its way down the steep slope toward a misty, domed web in the very center of the hollow, while its fellows closed in all around it, clicking their pincers excitedly at the sight of its load.\n\u3000\u3000Harry fell to the ground on all fours as the spider released him. Ron and Fang thudded down next to him. Fang wasn't howling anymore, but cowering silently on the spot. Ron looked exactly like Harry felt. His mouth was stretched wide in a kind of silent scream and his eyes were popping.\n\u3000\u3000Harry suddenly realized that the spider that had dropped him was saying something. It had been hard to tell, because he clicked his pincers with every word he spoke.\n\u3000\u3000\"Aragog!\" it called. \"Aragog!\"\n\u3000\u3000And from the middle of the misty, domed web, a spider the size of a small elephant emerged, very slowly. There was gray in the black of his body and legs, and each of the eyes on his ugly, pincered head was milky white. He was blind.\n\u3000\u3000\"What is it?\" he said, clicking his pincers rapidly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Men,\" clicked the spider who had caught Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Is it Hagrid?\" said Aragog, moving closer, his eight milky eyes wandering vaguely.\n\u3000\u3000\"Strangers,\" clicked the spider who had brought Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Kill them,\" clicked Aragog fretfully. \"I was sleeping ......\n\u3000\u3000\"We're friends of Hagrid's,\" Harry shouted. His heart seemed to have left his chest to pound in his throat.\n\u3000\u3000*216*\n\u3000\u3000Click, click, click went the pincers of the spiders all around the hollow.\n\u3000\u3000Aragog paused.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before,\" he said slowly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hagrid's in trouble,\" said Harry, breathing very fast. \"That's why we've come.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"In trouble?\" said the aged spider, and Harry thought he heard concern beneath the clicking pincers. \"But why has he sent you?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry thought of getting to his feet but decided against it; he didn't think his legs would support him. So he spoke from the ground, as calmly as he could.\n\u3000\u3000\"They think,, up at the school, that Hagrid's been setting a a - something on students. They've taken him to Azkaban.\"\n\u3000\u3000Aragog clicked his pincers furiously, and all around the hollow the sound was echoed by the crowd of spiders; it was like applause, except applause didn't usually make Harry feel sick with fear.\n\u3000\u3000\"But that was years ago,\" said Aragog fretfully. \"Years and years ago. I remember it well. That's why they made him leave the school. They believed that I was the monster that dwells in what they call the Chamber of Secrets. They thought that Hagrid had opened the Chamber and set me free.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"And you ... you didn't come from the Chamber of Secrets?\" said Harry, who could feel cold sweat on his forehead.\n\u3000\u3000\"I!\" said Aragog, clicking angrily. \"I was not born in the castle. I come from a distant land. A traveler gave me to Hagrid when I was an egg. Hagrid was only a boy, but he cared for me, hidden in a cupboard in the castle, feeding me on scraps from the table. Hagrid\n\u3000\u30002Y\n\u3000\u3000is my good friend, and a good man. When I was discovered, and blamed for the death of a girl, he protected me. I have lived here in the forest ever since, where Hagrid still visits me. He even found me a wife, Mosag, and you see how our family has grown, all through Hagrid's goodness ......\n\u3000\u3000Harry summoned what remained of his courage.\n\u3000\u3000\"So you never - never attacked anyone?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Never,\" croaked the old spider. \"It would have been my instinct, but out of respect for Hagrid, I never harmed a human. The body of the girl who was killed was discovered in a bathroom. I never saw any part of the castle but the cupboard in which I grew up. Our kind like the dark and the quiet ......\n\u3000\u3000\"But then ... Do you know what did kill that girl?\" said Harry. \"Because whatever it is, it's back and attacking people again -\"\n\u3000\u3000His words were drowned by a loud outbreak of clicking and the rustling of many long legs shifting angrily; large black shapes shifted all around him.\n\u3000\u3000\"The thing that lives in the castle,\" said Aragog, \"is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others. Well do I remember how I pleaded with Hagrid to let me go, when I sensed the beast moving about the school.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What is it?\" said Harry urgently.\n\u3000\u3000More loud clicking, more rustling; the spiders seemed to be closing in.\n\u3000\u3000\"We do not speak of it!\" said Aragog fiercely. \"We do not name it! I never even told Hagrid the name of that dread creature, though he asked me, many times.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't want to press the subject, not with the spiders\n\u3000\u3000* 2-V8 *\n\u3000\u3000pressing closer on all sides. Aragog seemed to be tired of tamng. He was backing slowly into his domed web, but his fellow spiders continued to inch slowly toward Harry and Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"We'll just go, then,\" Harry called desperately to Aragog, hearing leaves rustling behind him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Go?\" said Aragog slowly. \"I think not ......\n\u3000\u3000\"But - but -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid, on my command. But I cannot deny them fresh meat, when it wanders so willingly into our midst. Good-bye, friend of Hagrid.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry spun around. Feet away, towering above him, was a solid wall of spiders, clicking, their many eyes gleaming in their ugly black heads.\n\u3000\u3000Even as he reached for his wand, Harry knew it was no good, there were too many of them, but as he tried to stand, ready to die fighting, a loud, long note sounded, and a blaze of light flamed through the hollow.\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Weasley's car was thundering down the slope, headlights glaring, its horn screeching, knocking spiders aside; several were thrown onto their backs, their endless legs waving in the air. The car screeched to a halt in front of Harry and Ron and the doors flew open.\n\u3000\u3000\"Get Fang!\" Harry yelled, diving into the front seat; Ron seized the boarhound around the middle and threw him, yelping, into the back of the car - the doors slammed shut - Ron didn't touch the accelerator but the car didn't need him; the engine roared and they were off, hitting more spiders. They sped up the slope, out of the hollow, and they were soon crashing through the forest, branches\n\u3000\u3000whipping the windows as the car wound its way cleverly through the widest gaps, following a path it obviously knew.\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked sideways at Ron. His mouth was still open in the silent scream, but his eyes weren't popping anymore.\n\u3000\u3000\"Are you okay?\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron stared straight ahead, unable to speak.\n\u3000\u3000They smashed their way through the undergrowth, Fang howling loudly in the back seat, and Harry saw the side mirror snap off as they squeezed past a large oak. After ten noisy, rocky minutes, the trees thinned, and Harry could again see patches of sky.\n\u3000\u3000The car stopped so suddenly that they were nearly thrown into the windshield. They had reached the edge of the forest. Fang flung himself at the window in his anxiety to get out, and when Harry opened the door, he shot off through the trees to Hagrid's house, tail between his legs. Harry got out too, and after a minute or so, Ron seemed to regain the feeling in his limbs and followed, still stiff-necked and staring. Harry gave the car a grateful pat as it reversed back into the forest and disappeared from view.\n\u3000\u3000Harry went back into Hagrid's cabin to get the Invisibility Cloak. Fang was trembling under a blanket in his basket. When Harry got outside again, he found Ron being violently sick in the pumpkin patch.\n\u3000\u3000\"Follow the spiders,\" said Ron weakly, wiping his mouth on his sleeve. \"I'll never forgive Hagrid. We're lucky to be alive.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I bet he thought Aragog wouldn't hurt friends of his,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"That's exactly Hagrid's problem!\" said Ron, thumping the wall of the cabin. \"He always thinks monsters aren't as bad as they're\n\u3000\u3000*280*\n\u3000\u3000made out, and look where it's got him! A cell in Azkaban!\" He was shivering uncontrollably now. \"What was the point of sending us in there? What have we found out, Id like to know?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets,\" said Harry, throwing the cloak over Ron and prodding him in the arm to make him walk. \"He was innocent.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron gave a loud snort. Evidently, hatching Aragog in a cupboard wasn't his idea of being innocent.\n\u3000\u3000As the castle loomed nearer Harry twitched the cloak to make sure their feet were hidden, then pushed the creaking front doors ajar. They walked carefully back across the entrance hall and up the marble staircase, holding their breath as they passed corridors where watchful sentries were walking. At last they reached the safety of the Gryffindor common room, where the fire had burned itself into glowing ash. They took off the cloak and climbed the winding stair to their dormitory.\n\u3000\u3000Ron fell onto his bed without bothering to get undressed. Harry, however, didn't feel very sleepy. He sat on the edge of his fourposter, thinking hard about everything Aragog had said.\n\u3000\u3000The creature that was lurking somewhere in the castle, he thought, sounded like a sort of monster Voldemort - even other monsters didn't want to name it. But he and Ron were no closer to finding out what it was, or how it Petrified its victims. Even Hagrid had never known what was in the Chamber of Secrets.\n\u3000\u3000Harry swung his legs up onto his bed and leaned back against his pillows, watching the moon glinting at him through the tower window.\n\u3000\u3000He couldn't see what else they could do. They had hit dead ends\n\u3000\u3000*281*\n\u3000\u3000everywhere. Riddle had caught the wrong person, the Heir of Slytherin had got off, and no one could tell whether it was the same person, or a different one, who had opened the Chamber this time. There was nobody else to ask. Harry lay down, still thinking about what Aragog had said.\n\u3000\u3000He was becoming drowsy when what seemed like their very last hope occurred to him, and he suddenly sat bolt upright.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron,\" he hissed through the dark, \"Ron -\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron woke with a yelp like Fang's, stared wildly around, and saw Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron -that girl who died. Aragog said she was found in a bathroom,\" said Harry, ignoring Neville's snufing snores from the corner. \"What if she never left the bathroom? What if she's still there?\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron rubbed his eyes, frowning through the moonlight. And then he understood, too.\n\u3000\u3000\"You don't think - not Moaning Myrtle?\"\n\u3000\u3000A ll those times we were in that bathroom, and she was just\n\u3000\u3000three toilets away,\" said Ron bitterly at breakfast next day,\n\u3000\u3000\"and we could've asked her, and now. . .\"\n\u3000\u3000It had been hard enough trying to look for spiders. Escaping their teachers long enough to sneak into a girls' bathroom, the girls' bathroom, moreover, right next to the scene of the first attack, was going to be almost impossible.\n\u3000\u3000But something happened in their first lesson, Transfiguration, that drove the Chamber of Secrets out of their minds for the first time in weeks. Ten minutes into the class, Professor McGonagall told them that their exams would start on the first of June, one week from today.\n\u3000\u3000`Exams?\" howled Seamus Finnigan. \"We're still getting exams?\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a loud bang behind Harry as Neville Longbottom's wand slipped, vanishing one of the legs on his desk. Professorr\n\u3000\u3000*28%*\n\u3000\u3000McGonagall restored it with a wave of her own wand, and turned, frowning, to Seamus.\n\u3000\u3000\"The whole point of keeping the school open at this time is for you to receive your education,\" she said sternly. \"The exams will therefore take place as usual, and I trust you are all studying hard.\"\n\u3000\u3000Studying hard! It had never occurred to Harry that there would be exams with the castle in this state. There was a great deal of mutinous muttering around the room, which made Professor McGonagall scowl even more darkly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor Dumbledore's instructions were to keep the school running as normally as possible, she said. \"And that, I need hardly point out, means finding out how much you have learned this year.\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked down at the pair of white rabbits he was supposed to be turning into slippers. What had he learned so far this year? He couldn't seem to think of anything that would be useful in an exam.\n\u3000\u3000Ron looked as though he'd just been told he had to go and live in the Forbidden Forest.\n\u3000\u3000\"Can you imagine me taking exams with this?\" he asked Harry, holding up his wand, which had just started whistling loudly.\n\u3000\u3000Three days before their first exam, Professor McGonagall made another announcement at breakfast.\n\u3000\u3000\"I have good news,\" she said, and the Great Hall, instead of falling silent, erupted.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dumbledore's coming back!\" several people yelled joyfully.\n\u3000\u3000\"You've caught the Heir of Slytherin!\" squealed a girl at the Ravenclaw table.\n\u3000\u3000284*\n\u3000\u3000\"Quidditch matches are back on!\" roared Wood excitedly.\n\u3000\u3000When the hubbub had subsided, Professor McGonagall said, \"Professor Sprout has informed me that the Mandrakes are ready for cutting at last. Tonight, we will be able to revive those people who have been Petrified. I need hardly remind you all that one of them may well be able to tell us who, or what, attacked them. I am hopeful that this dreadful year will end with our catching the culprit.\"\n\u3000\u3000There was an explosion of cheering. Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and wasn't at all surprised to see that Draco Malfoy hadn't joined in. Ron, however, was looking happier than he'd looked in days.\n\u3000\u3000\"It won't matter that we never asked Myrtle, then!\" he said to Harry. \"Hermione'll probably have all the answers when they wake her up! Mind you, she'll go crazy when she finds out we've got exams in three days' time. She hasn't studied. It might be kinder to leave her where she is till they're over.\"\n\u3000\u3000Just then, Ginny Weasley came over and sat down next to Ron. She looked tense and nervous, and Harry noticed that her hands were twisting in her lap.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's up?\" said Ron, helping himself to more porridge.\n\u3000\u3000Ginny didn't say anything, but glanced up and down the Gryffindor table with a scared look on her face that reminded Harry of someone, though he couldn't think who.\n\u3000\u3000\"Spit it out,\" said Ron, watching her.\n\u3000\u3000Harry suddenly realized who Ginny looked like. She was rocking backward and forward slightly in her chair, exactly like Dobby did when he was teetering on the edge of revealing forbidden information.\n\u3000\u3000\"I've got to tell you something,\" Ginny mumbled, carefully not looking at Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"What is it?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000Ginny looked as though she couldn't find the right words.\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\"said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000Ginny opened her mouth, but no sound came out. Harry leaned forward and spoke quietly, so that only Ginny and Ron could hear him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Is it something about the Chamber of Secrets? Have you seen something? Someone acting oddly?\"\n\u3000\u3000Ginny drew a deep breath and, at that precise moment, Percy Weasley appeared, looking tired and wan.\n\u3000\u3000\"If you've finished eating, I'll take that seat, Ginny. I'm starving, I've only just come off patrol duty.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ginny jumped up as though her chair had just been electrified, gave Percy a fleeting, frightened look, and scampered away. Percy sat down and grabbed a mug from the center of the table.\n\u3000\u3000\"Percy!\" said Ron angrily. \"She was just about to tell us some-' thing important!\"\n\u3000\u3000Halfway through a gulp of tea, Percy choked.\n\u3000\u3000\"What sort of thing?\" he said, coughing.\n\u3000\u3000\"I just asked her if she'd seen anything odd, and she started to say\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh - that - that's nothing to do with the Chamber of Secrets,\" said Percy at once.\n\u3000\u3000\"How do you know?\" said Ron, his eyebrows raised.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, er, if you must know, Ginny, er, walked in on me the other day when I was - well, never mind - the point is, she spot\n\u3000\u3000ted me doing something and I, um, I asked her not to mention it to anybody. I must say, I did think she'd keep her word. It's nothing, really, Id just rather -\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry had never seen Percy look so uncomfortable.\n\u3000\u3000\"What were you doing, Percy?\" said Ron, grinning. \"Go on, tell us, we won't laugh.\"\n\u3000\u3000Percy didn't smile back.\n\u3000\u3000\"Pass me those rolls, Harry, I'm starving.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry knew the whole mystery might be solved tomorrow without their help, but he wasn't about to pass up a chance to speak to Myrtle if it turned up - and to his delight it did, midmorning, when they were being led to History of Magic by Gilderoy Lockhart.\n\u3000\u3000Lockhart, who had so often assured them that all danger had passed, only to be proved wrong right away, was now wholeheartedly convinced that it was hardly worth the trouble to see them safely down the corridors. His hair wasn't as sleek as usual; it seemed he had been up most of the night, patrolling the fourth floor.\n\u3000\u3000\"Mark my words,\" he said, ushering them around a corner. \"The first words out of those poor Petrified people's mouths will be It was Hagrid.' Frankly, I'm astounded Professor McGonagall thinks all these security measures are necessary.\"\n\u3000\u3000(ti agree, sir,\" said Harry, making Ron drop his books in surprise.\n\u3000\u3000\"Thank you, Harry, said Lockhart graciously while they waited for a long line of Hufflepuffs to pass. \"I mean, we teachers have quite enough to be getting on with, without walking students to classes and standing guard all night ......\n\u3000\u3000\"That's right,\" said Ron, catching on. \"Why don't you leave us here, sir, we've only got one more corridor to go -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You know, Weasley, I think I will,\" said Lockhart. \"I really should go and prepare my next class -\"\n\u3000\u3000And he hurried off.\n\u3000\u3000\"Prepare his class,\" Ron sneered after him. \"Gone to curl his hair, more like.\"\n\u3000\u3000They let the rest of the Gryffindors draw ahead of them, then darted down a side passage and hurried off toward Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. But just as they were congratulating each other on their brilliant scheme\n\u3000\u3000\"Potter! Weasley! What are you doing?\"\n\u3000\u3000It was Professor McGonagall, and her mouth was the thinnest of thin lines.\n\u3000\u3000\"We were -we were-\" Ron stammered. \"We were going to - to go and see -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione,\" said Harry. Ron and Professor McGonagall both looked at him.\n\u3000\u3000\"We haven't seen her for ages, Professor,\" Harry went on hurriedly, treading on Ron's foot, \"and we thought we'd sneak into the hospital wing, you know, and tell her the Mandrakes are nearly ready and, er, not to worry -\"\n\u3000\u3000Professor McGonagall was still staring at him, and for a moment, Harry thought she was going to explode, but when she spoke, it was in a strangely croaky voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"Of course,\" she said, and Harry, amazed, saw a tear glistening in her beady eye. \"Of course, I realize this has all been hardest on the friends of those who have been ... I quite understand. Yes,\n\u3000\u3000Potter, of course you may visit Miss Granger. I will inform Professor Binns where you've gone. Tell Madam Pomfrey I have given my permission.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron walked away, hardly daring to believe that they'd avoided detention. As they turned the corner, they distinctly heard Professor McGonagall blow her nose.\n\u3000\u3000\"That,\" said Ron fervently, \"was the best story you've ever come up with.\"\n\u3000\u3000They had no choice now but to go to the hospital wing and tell Madam Pomfrey that they had Professor McGonagall's permission to visit Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000Madam Pomfrey let them in, but reluctantly.\n\u3000\u3000\"There's just no point talking to a Petrified. person,\" she said, and they had to admit she had a point when they'd taken their seats next to Hermione. It was plain that Hermione didn't have the faintest inkling that she had visitors, and that they might just as well tell her bedside cabinet not to worry for all the good it would do.\n\u3000\u3000\"Wonder if she did see the attacker, though?\" said Ron, looking sadly at Hermione's rigid face. \"Because if he sneaked up on them all, no one'll ever know . .....\n\u3000\u3000But Harry wasn't looking at Hermione's face. He was more interested in her right hand. It lay clenched on top of her blankets, and bending closer, he saw that a piece of paper was scrunched inside her fist.\n\u3000\u3000Making sure that Madam Pomfrey was nowhere near, he pointed this out to Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"TG and get it out,\" Ron whispered, shifting his chair so that he blocked Harry from Madam Pomfrey's view.\n\u3000\u3000It was no easy task. Hermione's hand was clamped so tightly around the paper that Harry was sure he was going to tear it. While Ron kept watch he tugged and twisted, and at last, after several tense minutes, the paper came free.\n\u3000\u3000It was a page torn from a very old library book. Harry smoothed it out eagerly and Ron leaned close to read it, too.\n\u3000\u3000Of the many fearsome beasts and monsters that roam our land, there is none more curious or more deadly than the Basilisk, known also as the King of Serpents. This snake, which may reach gigantic size and live many hundreds of years, is born\n\u3000\u3000from a chicken's egg, hatched beneath a toad. Its methods of killing are most wondrous, for aside from its deadly and venomous fangs, the Basilisk has a murderous stare, and all who are fixed with the beam of its eye shall suffer instant death. Spiders flee before the Basilisk, for it is their mortal enemy, and the Basilisk flees only from the crowing of the rooster, which is fatal to it.\n\u3000\u3000And beneath this, a single word had been written, in a hand Harry recognized as Hermione's. Pipes.\n\u3000\u3000It was as though somebody had just flicked a light on in his brain.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron,\" he breathed. \"This is it. This is the answer. The monster in the Chamber's a basilisk - a giant serpent! That why I've been hearing that voice all over the place, and nobody else has heard it. It's because I understand Parseltongue . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked up at the beds around him.\n\u3000\u3000\"The basilisk kills people by looking at them. But no one's died - because no one looked it straight in the eye. Colin saw it through his camera. The basilisk burned up all the film inside it, but Colin just got Petrified. Justin . . . Justin must've seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick! Nick got the full blast of it, but he couldn't die again . . . and Hermione and that Ravenclaw prefect were found with a mirror next to them. Hermione had just realized the monster was a basilisk. I bet you anything she warned the first person she met to look around corners with a mirror first! And that girl pulled out her mirror - and -\"\n\u3000\u3000Rods jaw had dropped.\n\u3000\u3000\"And Mrs. Norris?\" he whispered eagerly.\n\u3000\u3000Harry thought hard, picturing the scene on the night of Halloween.\n\u3000\u3000\"The water. . .\" he said slowly. \"The flood from Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. I bet you Mrs. Norris only saw the reflection . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000He scanned the page in his hand eagerly. The more he looked at it, the more it made sense.\n\u3000\u3000`: . . The crowing of the rooster . . . is fatal to it\"! he read aloud. \"Hagrid's roosters were killed! The Heir of Slytherin didn't want one anywhere near the castle once the Chamber was opened! Spidersflee before it.! It all fits!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But how's the basilisk been getting around the place?\" said Ron. \"A giant snake . . . Someone would've seen. . .\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry, however, pointed at the word Hermione had scribbled at the foot of the page.\n\u3000\u3000\"Pipes,\" he said. \"Pipes . . . Ron, it's been using the plumbing. I've been hearing that voice inside the walls . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000291*\n\u3000\u3000Ron suddenly grabbed Harry's arm. \"The entrance to the Chamber of Secrets!\" he said hoarsely. \"What if it's a bathroom? What if it's in -\" `= Moaning Myrtle's bathroom, \"said Harry. They sat there, excitement coursing through them, hardly able to believe it. \"This means,\" said Harry, \"I can't be the only Parselmouth in the school. The Heir of Slytherin's one, too. That's how he's been controlling the basilisk.\" \"What're we going to do?\" said Ron, whose eyes were flashing. \"Should we go straight to McGonagall?\" \"Let's go to the staff room,\" said Harry, jumping up. \"She'll be there in ten minutes. It's nearly break.\" They ran downstairs. Not wanting to be discovered hanging around in another corridor, they went straight into the deserted staff room. It was a large, paneled room full of dark, wooden chairs. Harry and Ron paced around it, too excited to sit down. But the bell to signal break never came. Instead, echoing through the corridors came Professor McGon agall's voice, magically magnified. `All students to return to their House dormitories at once. All teach ers return to the staff room. Immediately, please. \"\n\u3000\u3000Harry wheeled around to stare at Ron. \"Not another attack? Not now?\" \"What'll we do?\" said Ron, aghast. \"Go back to the dormitory?\" \"No,\" said Harry, glancing around. There was an ugly sort of wardrobe to his left, full of the teachers' cloaks. \"In here. Let's hear what it's all about. Then we can tell them what we've found out.\"\n\u3000\u3000They hid themselves inside it, listening to the rumbling of hundreds of people moving overhead, and the staff room door banging open. From between the musty folds of the cloaks, they watched the teachers filtering into the room. Some of them were looking puzzled, others downright scared. Then Professor McGonagall arrived.\n\u3000\u3000\"It has happened,\" she told the silent staff room. \"A student has been taken by the monster. Right into the Chamber itself.\"\n\u3000\u3000Professor Flitwick let out a squeal. Professor Sprout clapped her hands over her mouth. Snape gripped the back of a chair very hard and said, \"How can you be sure?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"The Heir of Slytherin,\" said Professor McGonagall, who was very white, \"left another message. Right underneath the first one. `Her skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever. \"'\n\u3000\u3000Professor Flitwick burst into tears.\n\u3000\u3000\"Who is it?\" said Madam Hooch, who had sunk, weak-kneed, into a chair. \"Which student?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ginny Weasley,\" said Professor McGonagall.\n\u3000\u3000Harry felt Ron slide silently down onto the wardrobe floor beside him.\n\u3000\u3000\"We shall have to send all the students home tomorrow,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"This is the end of Hogwarts. Dumbledore always said. . .\"\n\u3000\u3000The staffroom door banged open again. For one wild moment, Harry was sure it would be Dumbledore. But it was Lockhart, and he was beaming.\n\u3000\u3000\"So sorry - dozed off - what have I missed?\"\n\u3000\u3000He didn't seem to notice that the other teachers were looking at him with something remarkably like hatred. Snape stepped forward.\n\u3000\u3000\"Just the man,\" he said. \"The very man. A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Taken into the Chamber of Secrets itself. Your moment has come at last.\"\n\u3000\u3000Lockhart blanched.\n\u3000\u3000\"That's right, Gilderoy,\" chipped in Professor Sprout. \"Weren't you saying just last night that you've known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I - well, I -\"sputtered Lockhart.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes, didn't you tell me you were sure you knew what was inside it?\" piped up Professor Flitwick.\n\u3000\u3000\"D-did I? I don't recall -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I certainly remember you saying you were sorry you hadn't had a crack at the monster before Hagrid was arrested,\" said Snape. \"Didn't you say that the whole affair had been bungled, and that you should have been given a free rein from the first?\"\n\u3000\u3000Lockhart stared around at his stony-faced colleagues.\n\u3000\u3000\"I - I really never - you may have misunderstood -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We'll leave it to you, then, Gilderoy,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Tonight will be an excellent time to do it. We'll make sure everyone's out of your way. You'll be able to tackle the monster all by youself. A free rein at last.\"\n\u3000\u3000Lockhart gazed desperately around him, but nobody came to the rescue. He didn't look remotely handsome anymore. His lip was trembling, and in the absence of his usually toothy grin, he looked weak-chinned and feeble.\n\u3000\u3000\"V very well,\" he said. \"I'll - I'll be in my office, getting getting ready.\"\n\u3000\u3000And he left the room.\n\u3000\u3000\"Right,\" said Professor McGonagall, whose nostrils were flared,\n\u3000\u3000\"that's got him out from under our feet. The Heads of Houses should go and inform their students what has happened. Tell them the Hogwarts Express will take them home first thing tomorrow. Will the rest of you please make sure no students have been left outside their dormitories.\"\n\u3000\u3000The teachers rose and left, one by one.\n\u3000\u3000It was probably the worst day of Harry's entire life. He, Ron, Fred, and George sat together in a corner of the Gryffindor common room, unable to say anything to each other. Percy wasn't there. He had gone to send an owl to Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, then shut himself up in his dormitory.\n\u3000\u3000No afternoon ever lasted as long as that one, nor had Gryffindor Tower ever been so crowded, yet so quiet. Near sunset, Fred and George went up to bed, unable to sit there any longer.\n\u3000\u3000\"She knew something, Harry,\" said Ron, speaking for the first time since they had entered the wardrobe in the staff room. \"That's why she was taken. It wasn't some stupid thing about Percy at all., She'd found out something about the Chamber of Secrets. That must be why she was -\" Ron rubbed his eyes frantically. \"I mean, she was a pure- blood. There can't be any other reason.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry could see the sun sinking, blood-red, below the skyline. This was the worst he had ever felt. If only there was something they could do. Anything.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry\" said Ron. \"D'you think there's any chance at all she's not - you know =\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't know what to say. He couldn't see how Ginny could still be alive.\n\u3000\u3000\"D'you know what?\" said Ron. \"I think we should go and see\n\u3000\u3000*295*\n\u3000\u3000Lockhart. Tell him what we know. He's going to try and get into the Chamber. We can tell him where we think it is, and tell him it's a basilisk in there.\"\n\u3000\u3000Because Harry couldn't think of anything else to do, and because he wanted to be doing something, he agreed. The Gryffindors around them were so miserable, and felt so sorry for the Weasleys, that nobody tried to stop them as they got up, crossed the room, and left through the portrait hole.\n\u3000\u3000Darkness was falling as they walked down to Lockhart's office. There seemed to be a lot of activity going on inside it. They could hear scraping, thumps, and hurried footsteps.\n\u3000\u3000Harry knocked and there was a sudden silence from inside. Then the door opened the tiniest crack and they saw one of Lockhart's eyes peering through it.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh - Mr. Potter - Mr. Weasley -\" he said, opening the door a bit wider. \"I'm rather busy at the moment - if you would be quick -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor, we've got some information for you,\" said Harry. \"We think it'll help you.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Er - well - it's not terribly -\" The side of Lockhart's face that they could see looked very uncomfortable. \"I mean - well all right -\"\n\u3000\u3000He opened the door and they entered.\n\u3000\u3000His office had been almost completely stripped. Two large trunks stood open on the floor. Robes, jade-green, lilac, midnightblue, had been hastily folded into one of them; books were jumbled untidily into the other. The photographs that had covered the walls were now crammed into boxes on the desk.\n\u3000\u3000*296*\n\u3000\u3000\"Are you going somewhere?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Er, well, yes,\" said Lockhart, ripping a life-size poster of himself from the back of the door as he spoke and starting to roll it up. \"Urgent call - unavoidable - got to go -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What about my sister?\" said Ron jerkily.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, as to that - most unfortunate -\" said Lockhart, avoiding their eyes as he wrenched open a drawer and started emptying the contents into a bag. \"No one regrets more than I -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You're the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher!\" said Harry. \"You can't go now! Not with all the Dark stuff going on here!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well - I must say - when I took the job -\" Lockhart muttered, now piling socks on top of his robes. \"nothing in the job description - didn't expect -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You mean you're running away?\" said Harry disbelievingly. \"After all that stuff you did in your books -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Books can be misleading,\" said Lockhart delicately.\n\u3000\u3000\"You wrote them!\" Harry shouted.\n\u3000\u3000\"My dear boy,\" said Lockhart, straightening up and frowning at Harry. \"Do use your common sense. My books wouldn't have sold half as well if people didn't think Id done all those things. No one wants to read about some ugly old Armenian warlock, even if he did save a village from werewolves. He'd look dreadful on the front cover. No dress sense at all. And the witch who banished the Bandon Banshee had a harelip. I mean, come on -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"So you've just been taking credit for what a load of other people have done?\" said Harry incredulously.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, Harry,\" said Lockhart, shaking his head impatiently, \"it's not nearly as simple as that. There was work involved. I had\n\u3000\u3000*297*\n\u3000\u3000to track these people down. Ask them exactly how they managed to do what they did. Then I had to put a Memory Charm on them so they wouldn't remember doing it. If there's one thing I pride myself on, it's my Memory Charms. No, it's been a lot of work, Harry. It's not all book signings and publicity photos, you know. You want fame, you have to be prepared for a long hard slog.\"\n\u3000\u3000He banged the lids of his trunks shut and locked them.\n\u3000\u3000\"Let's see,\" he said. \"I think that's everything. Yes. Only one thing left.\"\n\u3000\u3000He pulled out his wand and turned to them.\n\u3000\u3000\"Awfully sorry, boys, but I'll have to put a Memory Charm on you now. Can't have you blabbing my secrets all over the place. Id never sell another book -\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry reached his wand just in time. Lockhart had barely raised his, when Harry bellowed, \"Expelliarmus!\"\n\u3000\u3000Lockhart was blasted backward, falling over his trunk; his wand flew high into the air; Ron caught it, and flung it out of the open window.\n\u3000\u3000\"Shouldn't have let Professor Snape teach us that one,\" said Harry furiously, kicking Lockhart's trunk aside. Lockhart was looking up at him, feeble once more. Harry was still pointing his wand at him.\n\u3000\u3000\"What d'you want me to do?\" said Lockhart weakly. \"I don't know where the Chamber of Secrets is. There's nothing I can do.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You're in luck,\" said Harry, forcing Lockhart to his feet at wandpoint. \"We think we know where it is. And what's inside it. Let's go.\"\n\u3000\u3000*298*\n\u3000\u3000They marched Lockhart out of his office and down the nearest stairs, along the dark corridor where the messages shone on the wall, to the door of Moaning Myrtle's bathroom.\n\u3000\u3000They sent Lockhart in first. Harry was pleased to see that he was shaking.\n\u3000\u3000Moaning Myrtle was sitting on the tank of the end toilet.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, it's you,\" she said when she saw Harry. \"What do you want this time?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"To ask you how you died,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000Myrtle's whole aspect changed at once. She looked as though she had never been asked such a flattering question.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ooooh, it was dreadful,\" she said with relish. \"It happened right in here. I died in this very stall. I remember it so well. Id hidden because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses. The door was locked, and I was crying, and then I heard somebody come in. They said something funny. A different language, I think it must have been. Anyway, what really got me was that it was a boy speaking. So I unlocked the door, to tell him to go and use his own toilet, and then -\" Myrtle swelled importantly, her face shining. \"I died.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"How?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"No idea,\" said Myrtle in hushed tones. \"I just remember seeing a pair of great, big, yellow eyes. My whole body sort of seized up, and then I was floating away . . . .\" She looked dreamily at Harry. \"And then I came back again. I was determined to haunt Olive Hornby, you see. Oh, she was sorry she'd ever laughed at my glasses.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Where exactly did you see the eyes?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000*299*\n\u3000\u3000\"Somewhere there,\" said Myrtle, pointing vaguely toward the sink in front of her toilet.\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron hurried over to it. Lockhart was standing well back, a look of utter terror on his face.\n\u3000\u3000It looked like an ordinary sink. They examined every inch of it, inside and out, including the pipes below. And then Harry saw it: Scratched on the side of one of the copper taps was a tiny snake.\n\u3000\u3000\"That tap's never worked,\" said Myrtle brightly as he tried to turn it.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry,\" said Ron. \"Say something. Something in Parseltongue.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But -\" Harry thought hard. The only times he'd ever managed to speak Parseltongue were when he'd been faced with a real snake. He stared hard at the tiny- engraving, trying to imagine it was real.\n\u3000\u3000\"Open up,\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000He looked at Ron, who shook his head.\n\u3000\u3000\"English,\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked back at the snake, willing himself to believe it was alive. If he moved his head, the candlelight made it look as though it were moving.\n\u3000\u3000\"Open up,\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000Except that the words weren't what he heard; a strange hissing had escaped him, and at once the tap glowed with a brilliant white light and began to spin. Next second, the sink began to move; the sink, in fact, sank, right out of sight, leaving a large pipe exposed, a pipe wide enough for a man to slide into.\n\u3000\u3000Harry heard Ron gasp and looked up again. He had made up his mind what he was going to do.\n\u3000\u3000*300*\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm going down there,\" he said. .\n\u3000\u3000He couldn't not go, not now they had found the entrance to the Chamber, not if there was even the faintest, slimmest, wildest chance that Ginny might be alive.\n\u3000\u3000\"Me too,\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000There was a pause.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, you hardly seem to need me,\" said Lockhart, with a shadow of his old smile. \"I'll just -\"\n\u3000\u3000He put his hand on the door knob, but Ron and Harry both pointed their wands at him.\n\u3000\u3000\"You can go first,\" Ron snarled.\n\u3000\u3000White-faced and wandless, Lockhart approached the opening.\n\u3000\u3000\"Boys,\" he said, his voice feeble. \"Boys, what good will it do?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry jabbed him in the back with his wand. Lockhart slid his legs into the pipe.\n\u3000\u3000\"I really don't think -\" he started to say, but Ron gave him a push, and he slid out of sight. Harry followed quickly. He lowered himself slowly into the pipe, then let go.\n\u3000\u3000It was like rushing down an endless, slimy, dark slide. He could see more pipes branching off in all directions, but none as large as theirs, which twisted and turned, sloping steeply downward, and he knew that he was falling deeper below the school than even the dungeons. Behind him he could hear Ron, thudding slightly at the curves.\n\u3000\u3000And then, just as he had begun to worry about what would happen when he hit the ground, the pipe leveled out, and he shot out of the end with a wet thud, landing on the damp floor of a dark stone tunnel large enough to stand in. Lockhart was getting to his\n\u3000\u3000*301\n\u3000\u3000feet a little ways away, covered in slime and white as a ghost. Harry stood aside as Ron came whizzing out of the pipe, too.\n\u3000\u3000\"We must be miles under the school,\" said Harry, his voice echoing in the black tunnel.\n\u3000\u3000\"Under the lake, probably,\" said Ron, squinting around at the dark, slimy walls.\n\u3000\u3000All three of them turned to stare into the darkness ahead.\n\u3000\u3000\"Lumos!\" Harry muttered to his wand and it lit again. \"C'mon,\" he said to Ron and Lockhart, and off they went, their footsteps slapping loudly on the wet floor.\n\u3000\u3000The tunnel was so dark that they could only see a little distance ahead. Their shadows on the wet walls looked monstrous in the wandlight.\n\u3000\u3000\"Remember,\" Harry said quietly as they walked cautiously forward, \"any sign of movement, close your eyes right away . .....\n\u3000\u3000But the tunnel was quiet as the grave, and the first unexpected sound they heard was a loud crunch as Ron stepped on what turned out to be a rat's skull. Harry lowered his wand to look at the floor and saw that it was littered with small animal bones. Trying very hard not to imagine what Ginny might look like if they found her, Harry led the way forward, around a dark bend in the tunnel.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry - there's something up there -\" said Ron hoarsely, grabbing Harry's shoulder.\n\u3000\u3000They froze, watching. Harry could just see the outline of something huge and curved, lying right across the tunnel. It wasn't moving.\n\u3000\u3000\"Maybe it's asleep,\" he breathed, glancing back at the other two. Lockhart's hands were pressed over his eyes. Harry turned back to look at the thing, his heart beating so fast it hurt.\n\u3000\u3000* 302 *\n\u3000\u3000Very slowly, his eyes as narrow as he could make them and still see, Harry edged forward, his wand held high.\n\u3000\u3000The light slid over a gigantic snake skin, of a vivid, poisonous green, lying curled and empty across the tunnel floor. The creature that had shed it must have been twenty feet long at least.\n\u3000\u3000\"Blimey,\" said Ron weakly.\n\u3000\u3000There was a sudden movement behind them. Gilderoy Lockhart's knees had given way.\n\u3000\u3000\"Get up,\" said Ron sharply, pointing his wand at Lockhart.\n\u3000\u3000Lockhart got to his feet - then he dived at Ron, knocking him to the ground.\n\u3000\u3000Harry jumped forward, but too late - Lockhart was straightening up, panting, Ron's wand in his hand and a gleaming smile back on his face.\n\u3000\u3000\"The adventure ends here, boys!\" he said. \"I shall take a bit of this skin back up to the school, tell them I was too late to save the girl, and that you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body - say good-bye to your memories!\"\n\u3000\u3000He raised Ron's Spellotaped wand high over his head and yelled, \"Obliviate!\"\n\u3000\u3000The wand exploded with the force of a small bomb. Harry flung his arms over his head and ran, slipping over the coils of snake skin, out of the way of great chunks of tunnel ceiling that were thundering to the floor. Next moment, he was standing alone, gazing at a solid wall of broken rock.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron!\" he shouted. \"Are you okay? Ron!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm here!\" came Ron's muffled voice from behind the rockfall. \"I'm okay - this git's not, though - he got blasted by the wand ='\n\u3000\u3000*303*\n\u3000\u3000There was a dull thud and a loud \"ow!\" It sounded as though Ron had just kicked Lockhart in the shins.\n\u3000\u3000\"What now?\" Ron's voice said, sounding desperate. \"We can't get through - it'll take ages ......\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked up at the tunnel ceiling. Huge cracks had appeared in it. He had never tried to break apart anything as large as these rocks by magic, and now didn't seem a good moment to try - what if the whole tunnel caved in?\n\u3000\u3000There was another thud and another \"ow!\" from behind the rocks. They were wasting time. Ginny had already been in the Chamber of Secrets for hours .... Harry knew there was only one thing to do.\n\u3000\u3000\"Wait there,\" he called to Ron. \"Wait with Lockhart. I'll go on.... If I'm not back in an hour. . .\n\u3000\u3000There was a very pregnant pause,\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll try and shift some of this rock,\" said Ron, who seemed to be trying to keep his voice steady. \"So you can - can get back through. And, Harry -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"See you in a bit,\" said Harry, trying to inject some confidence into his shaking voice.\n\u3000\u3000And he set off alone past the giant snake skin.\n\u3000\u3000Soon the distant noise of Ron straining to shift the rocks was gone. The tunnel turned and turned again. Every nerve in Harry's body was tingling unpleasantly. He wanted the tunnel to end, yet dreaded what he'd find when it did. And then, at last, as he crept around yet another bend, he saw a solid wall ahead on which two entwined serpents were carved, their eyes set with great, glinting emeralds.\n\u3000\u3000*304*\n\u3000\u3000Harry approached, his throat very dry. There was no need to pretend these stone snakes were real; their eyes looked strangely alive.\n\u3000\u3000He could guess what he had to do. He cleared his throat, and the emerald eyes seemed to flicker.\n\u3000\u3000\"Open, \"said Harry, in a low, faint hiss.\n\u3000\u3000The serpents parted as the wall cracked open, the halves slid smoothly out of sight, and Harry, shaking from head to foot, walked inside.\n\u3000\u3000e was standing at the end of a very long, dimly lit chamber. Towering stone pillars entwined with more carved serpents rose to support a ceiling lost in darkness, casting long, black shadows through the odd, greenish gloom that filled the place.\n\u3000\u3000His heart beating very fast, Harry stood listening to the chill silence. Could the basilisk be lurking in a shadowy corner, behind a pillar? And where was Ginny?\n\u3000\u3000He pulled out his wand and moved forward between the serpentine columns. Every careful footstep echoed loudly off the shadowy walls. He kept his eyes narrowed, ready to clamp them shut at the smallest sign of movement. The hollow eye sockets of the stone snakes seemed to be following him. More than once, with a jolt of the stomach, he thought he saw one stir.\n\u3000\u3000Then, as he drew level with the last pair of pillars, a statue high as the Chamber itself loomed into view, standing against the back wall.\n\u3000\u3000*306*\n\u3000\u3000Harry had to crane his neck to look up into the giant face above: It was ancient and monkeyish, with a long, thin beard that fell almost to the bottom of the wizard's sweeping stone robes, where two enormous gray feet stood on the smooth Chamber floor. And between the feet, facedown, lay a small, black-robed figure with flaming-red hair.\n\u3000\u3000\"tinny!\" Harry muttered, sprinting to her and dropping to his knees. \"tinny - don't be dead - please don't be dead -\" He flung his wand aside, grabbed Ginny's shoulders, and turned her over. Her face was white as marble, and as cold, yet her eyes were closed, so she wasn't Petrified. But then she must be\n\u3000\u3000\"Ginny, please wake up,\" Harry muttered desperately, shaking her. Ginny's head lolled hopelessly from side to side.\n\u3000\u3000\"She won't wake,\" said a soft voice.\n\u3000\u3000Harry jumped and spun around on his knees.\n\u3000\u3000A tall, black-haired boy was leaning against the nearest pillar, watching. He was strangely blurred around the edges, as though Harry were looking at him through a misted window. But there was no mistaking him\n\u3000\u3000\"Tom - Tom Riddle?\"\n\u3000\u3000Riddle nodded, not taking his eyes off Harry's face.\n\u3000\u3000\"What d'you mean, she won't wake?\" Harry said desperately. \"She's not - she's not -?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"She's still alive,\" said Riddle. \"But only just.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry stared at him. Tom Riddle had been at Hogwarts fifty years ago, yet here he stood, a weird, misty light shining about him, not a day older than sixteen.\n\u3000\u3000\"Are you a ghost?\" Harry said uncertainly.\n\u3000\u3000* 30 7*\n\u3000\u3000\"A memory,\" said Riddle quietly. \"Preserved in a diary for fifty years.\n\u3000\u3000He pointed toward the floor near the statue's giant toes. Lying open there was the little black diary Harry had found in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. For a second, Harry wondered how it had got there - but there were more pressing matters to deal with.\n\u3000\u3000\"You've got to help me, Tom,\" Harry said, raising Ginny's head again. \"We've got to get her out of here. There's a basilisk ... I don't know where it is, but it could be along any moment .... Please, help me -1)\n\u3000\u3000Riddle didn't move. Harry, sweating, managed to hoist Ginny half off the floor, and bent to pick up his wand again.\n\u3000\u3000But his wand had gone.\n\u3000\u3000\"Did you see -?\"\n\u3000\u3000He looked up. Riddle was still watching him - twirling Harry's wand between his long fingers.\n\u3000\u3000\"Thanks,\" said Harry, stretching out his hand for it.\n\u3000\u3000A smile curled the corners of Riddle's mouth. He continued to stare at Harry, twirling the wand idly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Listen,\" said Harry urgently, his knees sagging with Ginny's dead weight. \"We've got to go! If the basilisk comes -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It won't come until it is called,\" said Riddle calmly.\n\u3000\u3000Harry lowered Ginny back onto the floor, unable to hold her up any longer.\n\u3000\u3000\"What d'you mean?\" he said. \"Look, give me my wand, I might need it -\"\n\u3000\u3000Riddle's smile broadened.\n\u3000\u3000\"You won't be needing it,\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000*%08*\n\u3000\u3000Harry stared at him.\n\u3000\u3000\"What d'you mean, I won't be -?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I've waited a long time for this, Harry Potter,\" said Riddle. \"For the chance to see you. To speak to you.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Look,\" said Harry, losing patience, \"I don't think you get it. We're in the Chamber of Secrets. We can talk later -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We're going to talk now,\" said Riddle, still smiling broadly, and he pocketed Harry's wand.\n\u3000\u3000Harry stared at him. There was something very funny going on here ....\n\u3000\u3000\"How did Ginny get like this?\" he asked slowly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, that's an interesting question,\" said Riddle pleasantly. \"And quite a long story. I suppose the real reason Ginny Weasley's like this is because she opened her heart and spilled all her secrets to an invisible stranger.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What are you talking about?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"The diary,\" said Riddle. `My diary. Little Ginny's been writing in it for months and months, telling me all her pitiful worries and woes - how her brothers tease her, how she had to come to school with secondhand robes and books, how\" -Riddle's eyes glinted \"how she didn't think famous, good, great Harry Potter would ever like her . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000All the time he spoke, Riddle's eyes never left Harry's face. There was an almost hungry look in them.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's very boring, having to listen to the silly little troubles of an eleven- year-old girl,\" he went on. \"But I was patient. I wrote back. I was sympathetic, I was kind. Ginny simply loved me. No one's ever understood me like you, Tom .... I'm so glad I've got this diary to\n\u3000\u3000*309*\n\u3000\u3000confide in .... It's like having a friend I can carry around in my pocket . . . .\n\u3000\u3000Riddle laughed, a high, cold laugh that didn't suit him. It made the hairs stand up on the back of Harry's neck.\n\u3000\u3000\"If I say it myself, Harry, I've always been able to charm the people I needed. So Ginny poured out her soul to me, and her soul happened to be exactly what I wanted .... I grew stronger and stronger on a diet of her deepest fears, her darkest secrets. I grew powerful, far more powerful than little Miss Weasley. Powerful enough to start feeding Miss Weasley a few of my secrets, to start pouring a little of my soul back into her. . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What d'you mean?\" said Harry, whose mouth had gone very dry.\n\u3000\u3000\" Haven't you guessed yet, Harry Potter?\" said Riddle softly. \"Ginny Weasley opened the Chamber of Secrets. She strangled the school roosters and daubed threatening messages on the walls. She set the Serpent of Slytherin on four Mudbloods, and the Squib's cat.\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" Harry whispered.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" said Riddle, calmly. \"Of course, she didn't know what she was doing at first. It was very amusing. I wish you could have seen her new diary entries ... far more interesting, they became .... Dear Tom,\" he recited, watching Harry's horrified face, `I think I'm losing my memory. There are rooster feathers all over my robes and 1 don't know how they got there. Dear Tom, l can't remember what 1 did on the night of Halloween, but a cat was attacked and I've got paint all down my front. Dear Tom, Percy keeps telling me I'm pale and I'm not myself. I think he suspects me... There was another attack today\n\u3000\u3000*310\n\u3000\u3000and I don't know where I was. Tom, what am I going to do? I think I'm going mad... I think I'm the one attacking everyone, Tom!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry's fists were clenched, the nails digging deep into his Palms.\n\u3000\u3000\"it took a very long time for stupid little Ginny to stop trusting her diary,\" said Riddle. \"But she finally became suspicious and tried to dispose of it. And that's where you came in, Harry. You found it, and I couldn't have been more delighted. Of all the people who could have picked it up, it was you, the very person I was most anxious to meet . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"And why did you want to meet me?\" said Harry. Anger was coursing through him, and it was an effort to keep his voice steady.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, you see, Ginny told me all about you, Harry,\" said Riddle. \"Your whole fascinating history. \" His eyes roved over the lightning scar on Harry's forehead, and their expression grew hungrier. \"I knew I must find out more about you, talk to you, meet you if I could. So I decided to show you my famous capture of that great oaf, Hagrid, to gain your trust -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hagrid's my friend,\" said Harry, his voice now shaking. \"And you framed him, didn't you? I thought you made a mistake, but -\"\n\u3000\u3000Riddle laughed his high laugh again.\n\u3000\u3000\"It was my word against Hagrid's, Harry. Well, you can imagine how it looked to old Armando Dippet. On the one hand, Tom Riddle, poor but brilliant, parentless but so brave, school prefect, model student ... on the other hand, big, blundering Hagrid, in trouble every other week, trying to raise werewolf cubs under his bed, sneaking off to the Forbidden Forest to wrestle trolls ... but I\n\u3000\u3000* 31:L *\n\u3000\u3000admit, even I was surprised how well the plan worked. I thought someone must realize that Hagrid couldn't possibly be the Heir of Slytherin. It had taken me five whole years to find out everything I could about the Chamber of Secrets and discover the secret entrance ... as though Hagrid had the brains, or the power!\n\u3000\u3000\"Only the Transfiguration teacher, Dumbledore, seemed to think Hagrid was innocent. He persuaded Dipper to keep Hagrid and train him as gamekeeper. Yes, I think Dumbledore might have guessed .... Dumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the other teachers did ......\n\u3000\u3000\"I bet Dumbledore saw right through you,\" said Harry, his teeth gritted.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, he certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after Hagrid was expelled,\" said Riddle carelessly. \"I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the Chamber again while I was still at school. But I wasn't going to waste those long years Id spent searching for it. I decided to leave behind a diary, preserving my sixteen-year-old self in its pages, so that one day, with luck, I would be able to lead another in my footsteps, and finish Salazar Slytherin's noble work.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, you haven't finished it,\" said Harry triumphantly. \"No one's died this time, not even the cat. In a few hours the Mandrake Draught will be ready and everyone who was Petrified will be all right again -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Haven't I already told you,\" said Riddle quietly, \"that killing Mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore? For many months now, my new target has been -you.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry stared at him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Imagine how angry I was when the next time my diary was\n\u3000\u3000*312*\n\u3000\u3000opened, it was Ginny who was writing to me, not you. She saw you with the diary, you see, and panicked. \"What if you found out how to work it, and I repeated all her secrets to you? What if, even worse, I told you who'd been strangling roosters? So the foolish little brat waited until your dormitory was deserted and stole it back. But I knew what I must do. It was clear to me that you were on the trail of Slytherin's heir. From everything Ginny had told me about you, I knew you would go to any lengths to solve the mystery --\n\u3000\u3000particularly if one of your best friends was attacked. And Ginny had told me the whole school was buzzing because you could speak Parseltongue ....\n\u3000\u3000\"So I made Ginny write her own farewell on the wall and come down here to wait. She struggled and cried and became very boring. But there isn't much life left in her .... She put too much into the diary, into me. Enough to let me leave its pages at last .... I have been waiting for you to appear since we arrived here. I knew you'd come. I have many questions for you, Harry Potter.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Like what?\" Harry spat, fists still clenched.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well,\" said Riddle, smiling pleasantly, \"how is it that you a skinny boy with no extraordinary magical talent - managed to defeat the greatest wizard of all time? How did you escape with nothing but a scar, while Lord Voldemort's powers were destroyed?\"\n\u3000\u3000There was an odd red gleam in his hungry eyes now.\n\u3000\u3000\"Why do you care how I escaped?\" said Harry slowly. \"Voldemort was after your time ......\n\u3000\u3000\"Voldemort,\" said Riddle softly, \"is my past, present, and future, Harry Potter . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000He pulled Harry's wand from his pocket and began to trace it through the air, writing three shimmering words:\n\u3000\u3000TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE\n\u3000\u3000Then he waved the wand once, and the letters of his name rearranged themselves:\n\u3000\u3000I AM LORD VOLDEMORT\n\u3000\u3000\"You see?\" he whispered. \"It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts, to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I was going to use my filthy Muggle father's name forever? I, in whose veins runs the blood of Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother's side? I, keep the name of a foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, just because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry - I fashioned myself a new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak, when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry's brain seemed to have jammed. He stared numbly at Riddle, at the orphaned boy who had grown up to murder Harry's own parents, and so many others .... At last he forced himself to -,peak.\n\u3000\u3000\"You're not,\" he said, his quiet voice full of hatred.\n\u3000\u3000\"Not what?\" snapped Riddle.\n\u3000\u3000\"Not the greatest sorcerer in the world,\" said Harry, breathing fast. \"Sorry to disappoint you and all that, but the greatest wizard in the world is Albus Dumbledore. Everyone says so. Even when you were strong, you didn't dare try and take over at Hogwarts. Dumbledore saw through you when you were at school and he still frightens you now, wherever you're hiding these days -\"\n\u3000\u3000The smile had gone from Riddle's face, to be replaced by a very ugly look.\n\u3000\u3000*31-4*\n\u3000\u3000\"Dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me!\" he hissed.\n\u3000\u3000\"He's not as gone as you might think!\" Harry retorted. He was speaking at random, wanting to scare Riddle, wishing rather than believing it to be true\n\u3000\u3000Riddle opened his mouth, but froze.\n\u3000\u3000Music was coming from somewhere. Riddle whirled around to stare down the empty Chamber. The music was growing louder. It was eerie, spine-tingling, unearthly; it lifted the hair on Harry's scalp and made his heart feel as though it was swelling to twice its normal size. Then, as the music reached such a pitch that Harry felt it vibrating inside his own ribs, flames erupted at the top of the nearest pillar.\n\u3000\u3000A crimson bird the size of a swan had appeared, piping its weird music to the vaulted ceiling. It had a glittering golden tail as long as a peacock's and gleaming golden talons, which were gripping a ragged bundle.\n\u3000\u3000A second later, the bird was flying straight at Harry. It dropped the ragged thing it was carrying at his feet, then landed heavily on his shoulder. As it folded its great wings, Harry looked up and saw it had a long, sharp golden beak and a beady black eye.\n\u3000\u3000The bird stopped singing. It sat still and warm next to Harry's cheek, gazing steadily at Riddle.\n\u3000\u3000\"That's a phoenix\tsaid Riddle, staring shrewdly back at it.\n\u3000\u3000\"Fawkes?\" Harry breathed, and he felt the bird's golden claws squeeze his shoulder gently\n\u3000\u3000\"And that -\" said Riddle, now eyeing the ragged thing that Fawkes had dropped, \"that's the old school Sorting Hat -\"\n\u3000\u3000So it was. Patched, frayed, and dirty, the hat lay motionless at Harry's feet.\n\u3000\u3000Riddle began to laugh again. He laughed so hard that the dark chamber rang with it, as though ten Riddles were laughing at once\n\u3000\u3000\"This is what Dumbledore sends his defender! A songbird and an old hat! Do you feel brave, Harry Potter? Do you feel safe now?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't answer. He might not see what use Fawkes or the Sorting Hat were, but he was no longer alone, and he waited for Riddle to stop laughing with his courage mounting.\n\u3000\u3000\"To business, Harry,\" said Riddle, still smiling broadly. \"Twice - in your past, in my future - we have met. And twice I failed to kill you. How did you survive? Tell me everything. The longer you talk,\" he added softly, \"the longer you stay alive.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry was thinking fast, weighing his chances. Riddle had the wand. He, Harry, had Fawkes and the Sorting Hat, neither of which would be much good in a duel. It looked bad, all right ... but the longer Riddle stood there, the more life was dwindling out of Ginny ... and in the meantime, Harry noticed suddenly, Riddle's outline was becoming clearer, more solid .... If it had to be a fight between him and Riddle, better sooner than later.\n\u3000\u3000\"No one knows why you lost your powers when you attacked me,\" said Harry abruptly. \"I don't know myself But I know why you couldn't kill me. Because my mother died to save me. My common Muggle-born mother,\" he added, shaking with suppressed rage. \"She stopped you killing me. And I've seen the real you, I saw you last year. You're a wreck. You're barely alive. That's where all your power got you. You're in hiding. You're ugly, you're foul -\"\n\u3000\u3000*%16*\n\u3000\u3000Riddle's face contorted. Then he forced it into an awful smile. \"So. Your mother died to save you. Yes, that's a powerful countercharm. I can see now ... there is nothing special about you, after all. I wondered, you see. There are strange likenesses between us, after all. Even you must have noticed. Both half-bloods, orphans, raised by Muggles. Probably the only two Parselmouths to come to Hogwarts since the great Slytherin himself We even look something alike ... but after all, it was merely a lucky chance that saved you from me. That's all I wanted to know.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry stood, tense, waiting for Riddle to raise his wand. But Riddle's twisted smile was widening again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Now, Harry, I'm going to teach you a little lesson. Let's match the powers of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin, against famous Harry Potter, and the best weapons Dumbledore can give him . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000He cast an amused eye over Fawkes and the Sorting Hat, then walked away. Harry, fear spreading up his numb legs, watched Ridthe stop between the high pillars and look up into the stone face of Slytherin, high above him in the half-darkness. Riddle opened his mouth wide and hissed - but Harry understood what he was saying ....\n\u3000\u3000\"Speak to me, Slytherin, greatest of the Hogwarts Four. \"\n\u3000\u3000Harry wheeled around to look up at the statue, Fawkes swaying on his shoulder.\n\u3000\u3000Slytherin's gigantic stone face was moving. Horrorstruck, Harry saw his mouth opening, wider and wider, to make a huge black hole.\n\u3000\u3000And something was stirring inside the statue's mouth. Something was slithering up from its depths. 3 1\n\u3000\u3000Harry backed away until he hit the dark Chamber wall, and as he shut his eyes tight he felt Fawkes' wing sweep his cheek as he took flight. Harry wanted to shout, \"Don't leave me!\" but what chance did a phoenix have against the king of serpents?\n\u3000\u3000Something huge hit the stone floor of the Chamber. Harry felt it shudder - he knew what was happening, he could sense it, could almost see the giant serpent uncoiling itself from Slytherin's mouth. Then he heard Riddle's hissing voice:\n\u3000\u3000\"Kill him. \"\n\u3000\u3000The basilisk was moving toward Harry; he could hear its heavy body slithering heavily across the dusty floor. Eyes still tightly shut, Harry began to run blindly sideways, his hands outstretched, feeling his way - Voldemort was laughing\n\u3000\u3000Harry tripped. He fell hard onto the stone and tasted blood the serpent was barely feet from him, he could hear it coming\n\u3000\u3000There was a loud, explosive spitting sound right above him, and then something heavy hit Harry so hard that he was smashed into the wall. Waiting for fangs to sink through his body he heard more mad hissing, something thrashing wildly off the pillars\n\u3000\u3000He couldn't help it - he opened his eyes wide enough to squint at what was going on.\n\u3000\u3000The enormous serpent, bright, poisonous green, thick as an oak trunk, had raised itself high in the air and its great blunt head was weaving drunkenly between the pillars. As Harry trembled, ready to close his eyes if it turned, he saw what had distracted the snake.\n\u3000\u3000Fawkes was soaring around its head, and the basilisk was snapping furiously at him with fangs long and thin as sabers\n\u3000\u3000Fawkes dived. His long golden beak sank out of sight and a\n\u3000\u3000*318*\n\u3000\u3000sudden shower of dark blood spattered the floor. The snake's tail thrashed, narrowly missing Harry, and before Harry could shut his eyes, it turned - Harry looked straight into its face and saw that its eyes, both its great, bulbous yellow eyes, had been punctured by the phoenix; blood was streaming to the floor, and the snake was spitting in agony.\n\u3000\u3000\"NO!\" Harry heard Riddle screaming. \"LEAVE THE BIRD! LEAVE THE BIRD! THE BOY IS BEHIND YOU. YOU CAN STILL SMELL HIM. KILL HIMI\"\n\u3000\u3000The blinded serpent swayed, confused, still deadly. Fawkes was circling its head, piping his eerie song, jabbing here and there at its scaly nose as the blood poured from its ruined eyes.\n\u3000\u3000\"Help me, help me,\" Harry muttered wildly, \"someone - anyone\n\u3000\u3000The snake's tail whipped across the floor again. Harry ducked. Something soft hit his face.\n\u3000\u3000The basilisk had swept the Sorting Hat into Harry's arms. Harry seized it. It was all he had left, his only chance - he rammed it onto his head and threw himself flat onto the floor as the basilisk's tail swung over him again.\n\u3000\u3000Help me - help me - Harry thought, his eyes screwed tight under the hat. Please help me\n\u3000\u3000There was no answering voice. Instead, the hat contracted, as though an invisible hand was squeezing it very tightly.\n\u3000\u3000Something very hard and heavy thudded onto the top of Harry's head, almost knocking him out. Stars winking in front of his eyes, he grabbed the top of the hat to pull it off and felt something long and hard beneath it.\n\u3000\u30003 19\n\u3000\u3000A gleaming silver sword had appeared inside the hat, its handle glittering with rubies the size of eggs.\n\u3000\u3000\"KILL THE BOY! LEAVE THE BIRD! THE BOY IS BEHIND YOU. SNIFF -- SMELL HIM.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry was on his feet, ready. The basilisk's head was falling, its body coiling around, hitting pillars as it twisted to face him. He could see the vast, bloody eye sockets, see the mouth stretching wide, wide enough to swallow him whole, lined with fangs long as his sword, thin, glittering, venomous -\n\u3000\u3000It lunged blindly -- Harry dodged and it hit the Chamber wall. It lunged again, and its forked tongue lashed Harry's side. He raised the sword in both his hands -\n\u3000\u3000The basilisk lunged again, and this time its aim was true -- Harry threw his whole weight behind the sword and drove it to the hilt into the roof of the serpent's mouth -\n\u3000\u3000But as warm blood drenched Harry's arms, he felt a searing pain just above his elbow. One long, poisonous fang was sinking deeper and deeper into his arm and it splintered as the basilisk keeled over sideways and fell, twitching, to the floor.\n\u3000\u3000Harry slid down the wall. He gripped the fang that was spreading poison through his body and wrenched it out of his arm. But he knew it was too late. White-hot pain was spreading slowly and steadily from the wound. Even as he dropped the fang and watched his own blood soaking his robes, his vision went foggy. The Chamber was dissolving in a whirl of dull color.\n\u3000\u3000A patch of scarlet swam past, and Harry heard a soft clatter of claws beside him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Fawkes,\" said Harry thickly. \"You were fantastic, Fawkes . . . .\"\n\u3000\u30001,520\n\u3000\u3000He felt the bird lay its beautiful head on the spot where the serpent's fang had pierced him.\n\u3000\u3000He could hear echoing footsteps and then a dark shadow moved in front of him.\n\u3000\u3000\"You're dead, Harry Potter,\" said Riddle's voice above him. \"Dead. Even Dumbledore's bird knows it. Do you see what he's doing, Potter? He's crying.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry blinked. Fawke's head slid in and out of focus. Thick, pearly tears were trickling down the glossy feathers.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm going to sit here and watch you die, Harry Potter. Take your time. I'm in no hurry.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry felt drowsy. Everything around him seemed to be spinning.\n\u3000\u3000\"So ends the famous Harry Potter,\" said Riddle's distant voice. \"Alone in the Chamber of Secrets, forsaken by his friends, defeated at last by the Dark Lord he so unwisely challenged. You'll be back with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry... She bought you twelve years of borrowed time ... but Lord Voldemort got you in the end, as you knew he must . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000If this is dying, thought Harry, it's not so bad.\n\u3000\u3000Even the pain was leaving him ....\n\u3000\u3000But was this dying? Instead of going black, the Chamber seemed to be coming back into focus. Harry gave his head a little shake and there was Fawkes, still resting his head on Harry's arm. A pearly patch of tears was shining all around the wound -- except that there was no wound\n\u3000\u3000\"Get away, bird,\" said Riddle's voice suddenly. \"Get away from him - I said, get away --\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry raised his head. Riddle was pointing Harry's wand at\n\u3000\u3000Fawkes; there was a bang like a gun, and Fawkes took flight again in a whirl of gold and scarlet.\n\u3000\u3000\"Phoenix tears. - .\" said Riddle quietly, staring at Harry's arm. \"Of course ... healing powers ... I forgot. . .\"\n\u3000\u3000He looked into Harry's face. \"But it makes no difference. In fact, I prefer it this way. Just you and me, Harry Potter ... you and me....\n\u3000\u3000He raised the wand\n\u3000\u3000Then, in a rush of wings, Fawkes had soared back overhead and something fell into Harry's lap -- the diary.\n\u3000\u3000For a split second, both Harry and Riddle, wand still raised, stared at it. Then, without thinking, without considering, as though he had meant to do it all along, Harry seized the basilisk fang on the floor next to him and plunged it straight into the heart of the book.\n\u3000\u3000There was a long, dreadful, piercing scream. Ink spurted out of the diary in torrents, streaming over Harry's hands, flooding the floor. Riddle was writhing and twisting, screaming and flailing and then\n\u3000\u3000He had gone. Harry's wand fell to the floor with a clatter and there was silence. Silence except for the steady drip drip of ink still oozing from the diary. The basilisk venom had burned a sizzling hole right through it.\n\u3000\u3000Shaking all over, Harry pulled himself up. His head was spinning as though he'd just traveled miles by Floo powder. Slowly, he gathered together his wand and the Sorting Hat, and, with a huge tug, retrieved the glittering sword from the roof of the basilisk's mouth.\n\u3000\u3000Then came a faint moan from the end of the Chamber. Ginny was stirring. As Harry hurried toward her, she sat up. Her bemused\n\u3000\u30001,522\n\u3000\u3000eyes traveled from the huge form of the dead basilisk, over Harry, in his blood-soaked robes, then to the diary in his hand. She drew a great, shuddering gasp and tears began to pour down her face.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry -- oh, Harry -- I tried to tell you at b-breakfast, but I c-couldn't say it in front of Percy -- it was me, Harry -- but I -- I s-swear I d- diddt mean to -- R-Riddle made me, he t-took me over -- and - how did you kill that -- that thing? W-where's Riddle? The last thing I r- remember is him coming out of the diary --\"\n\u3000\u3000\" It's all right,\" said Harry, holding up the diary, and showing Ginny the fang hole, \"Riddle's finished. Look! Him and the basilisk. C'mon, Ginny, let's get out of here --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm going to be expelled!\" Ginny wept as Harry helped her awkwardly to her feet. \"I've looked forward to coming to Hogwarts ever since B-Bill came and n-now I'll have to leave and -- w-what'll Mum and Dad say?\"\n\u3000\u3000Fawkes was waiting for them, hovering in the Chamber entrance. Harry urged Ginny forward; they stepped over the motionless coils of the dead basilisk, through the echoing gloom, and back into the tunnel. Harry heard the stone doors close behind them with a soft hiss.\n\u3000\u3000After a few minutes' progress up the dark tunnel, a distant sound of slowly shifting rock reached Harry's ears.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron!\" Harry yelled, speeding up. \"Ginny's okay! I've got her!\"\n\u3000\u3000He heard Ron give a strangled cheer, and they turned the next bend to see his eager face staring through the sizable gap he had managed to make in the rock fall.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ginny!\" Ron thrust an arm through the gap in the rock to pull\n\u3000\u3000321,3\n\u3000\u3000her through first. \"You're alive! I don't believe it! What happened?\" How - what -- where did that bird come from?\"\n\u3000\u3000Fawkes had swooped through the gap after Ginny.\n\u3000\u3000\"He's Dumbledore's,\" said Harry, squeezing through himself\n\u3000\u3000\"How come you've got a sword?\" said Ron, gaping at the glittering weapon in Harry's hand.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll explain when we get out of here,\" said Harry with a sideways glance at Ginny, who was crying harder than ever.\n\u3000\u3000\"But --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Later,\" Harry said shortly. He didn't think it was a good idea to tell Ron yet who'd been opening the Chamber, not in front of Ginny, anyway. \"Where's Lockhart?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Back there,\" said Ron, still looking puzzled but jerking his head up the tunnel toward the pipe. \"He's in a bad way. Come and see.\"\n\u3000\u3000Led by Fawkes, whose wide scarlet wings emitted a soft golden glow in the darkness, they walked all the way back to the mouth of the pipe. Gilderoy Lockhart was sitting there, humming placidly to himself.\n\u3000\u3000\"His memory's gone,\" said Ron. \"The Memory Charm backfired. Hit him instead of us. Hasn't got a clue who he is, or where he is, or who we are. I told him to come and wait here. He's a danger to himself\"\n\u3000\u3000Lockhart peered good-naturedly up at them all.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hello,\" he said. \"Odd sort of place, this, isn't it? Do you live here?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Ron, raising his eyebrows at Harry.\n\u3000\u3000Harry bent down and looked up the long, dark pipe.\n\u3000\u3000\"Have you thought how we're going to get back up this?\" he said to Ron.\n\u3000\u3000*324*\n\u3000\u3000Ron shook his head, but Fawkes the phoenix had swooped past Harry and was now fluttering in front of him, his beady eyes bright in the dark. He was waving his long golden tail feathers. Harry looked uncertainly at him.\n\u3000\u3000\"He looks like he wants you to grab hold. . .\" said Ron, looking perplexed. \"But you're much too heavy for a bird to pull up there -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Fawkes,\" said Harry, \"isn't an ordinary bird.\" He turned quickly to the others. \"We've got to hold on to each other. Ginny, grab Ron's hand. Professor Lockhart --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He means you,\" said Ron sharply to Lockhart.\n\u3000\u3000\"You hold Ginny's other hand --\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry tucked the sword and the Sorting Hat into his belt, Ron took hold of the back of Harry's robes, and Harry reached out and took hold of Fawkes's strangely hot tail feathers.\n\u3000\u3000An extraordinary lightness seemed to spread through his whole body and the next second, in a rush of wings, they were flying upward through the pipe. Harry could hear Lockhart dangling below him, saying, \"Amazing! Amazing! This is just like magic!\" The chill air was whipping through Harry's hair, and before he'd stopped enjoying the ride, it was over -- all four of them were hitting the wet floor of Moaning Myrtle's bathroom, and as Lockhart straightened his hat, the sink that hid the pipe was sliding back into place.\n\u3000\u3000Myrtle goggled at them.\n\u3000\u3000\"You're alive,\" she said blankly to Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"There's no need to sound so disappointed,\" he said grimly, wiping flecks of blood and slime off his glasses.\n\u3000\u3000* 325*\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, well ... Id just been thinking ... if you had died, you'd have been welcome to share my toilet,\" said Myrtle, blushing silver.\n\u3000\u3000\"Urgh!\" said Ron as they left the bathroom for the dark, deserted corridor outside. \"Harry! I think Myrtle's grown fond of you! You've got competition, Ginny!\"\n\u3000\u3000But tears were still flooding silently down Ginny's face.\n\u3000\u3000\"Where now?\" said Ron, with an anxious look at Ginny. Harry pointed.\n\u3000\u3000Fawkes was leading the way, glowing gold along the corridor. They strode after him, and moments later, found themselves outside Professor McGonagall's office.\n\u3000\u3000Harry knocked and pushed the door open.\n\u3000\u3000G F-I A P T E IR\n\u3000\u3000k' I G 14 T V V N\n\u3000\u3000DO\n\u3000\u3000Y'$ REWARD\n\u3000\u3000or a moment there was silence as Harry, Ron, Ginny, and Lockhart stood in the doorway, covered in muck and slime and (in Harry's case) blood. Then there was a scream.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ginny!\"\n\u3000\u3000It was Mrs. Weasley, who had been sitting crying in front of the fire. She leapt to her feet, closely followed by Mr. Weasley, and both of them flung themselves on their daughter.\n\u3000\u3000Harry, however, was looking past them. Professor Dumbledore was standing by the mantelpiece, beaming, next to Professor McGonagall, who was taking great, steadying gasps, clutching her chest. Fawkes went whooshing past Harry's ear and settled on Dumbledore's shoulder, just as Harry found himself and Ron being swept into Mrs. Weasleys tight embrace.\n\u3000\u3000\"You saved her! You saved her! How did you do it?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I think we'd all like to know that,\" said Professor McGonagall weakly.\n\u3000\u3000Mrs. Weasley let go of Harry, who hesitated for a moment, then walked over to the desk and laid upon it the Sorting Hat, the rubyencrusted sword, and what remained of Riddle's diary.\n\u3000\u3000Then he started telling them everything. For nearly a quarter of an hour he spoke into the rapt silence: He told them about hearing the disembodied voice, how Hermione had finally realized that he was hearing a basilisk in the pipes; how he and Ron had followed the spiders into the forest, that Aragog had told them where the last victim of the basilisk had died; how he had guessed that Moaning Myrtle had been the victim, and that the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets might be in her bathroom ....\n\u3000\u3000\"Very well,\" Professor McGonagall prompted him as he paused, \"so you found out where the entrance was -- breaking a hundred school rules into pieces along the way, I might add - but how on earth did you all get out of there alive, Potter?\"\n\u3000\u3000So Harry, his voice now growing hoarse from all this talking, told them about Fawkes's timely arrival and about the Sorting Hat giving him the sword. But then he faltered. He had so far avoided mentioning Riddle's diary -- or Ginny. She was standing with her head against Mrs. Weasley's shoulder, and tears were still coursing silently down her cheeks. What if they expelled her? Harry thought in panic. Riddle's diary didn't work anymore .... How could they prove it had been he who'd made her do it all?\n\u3000\u3000Instinctively, Harry looked at Dumbledore, who smiled faintly, the firelight glancing off his half-moon spectacles.\n\u3000\u3000\"\\What interests me most,\" said Dumbledore gently, \"is how Lord Voldemort managed to enchant Ginny, when my sources tell me he is currently in hiding in the forests of Albania.\"\n\u3000\u3000*328*\n\u3000\u3000Relief -- warm, sweeping, glorious relief -- swept over Harry. \"W- what's that?\" said Mr. Weasley in a stunned voice. \"YouKnow-Who? En-enchant Ginny? But Ginny's not ... Ginny hasn't been ... has she?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It was this diary,\" said Harry quickly, picking it up and showing it to Dumbledore. \"Riddle wrote it when he was sixteen . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore took the diary from Harry and peered keenly down his long, crooked nose at its burnt and soggy pages.\n\u3000\u3000\"Brilliant,\" he said softly. \"Of course, he was probably the most brilliant student Hogwarts has ever seen.\" He turned around to the Weasleys, who were looking utterly bewildered.\n\u3000\u3000\"Very few people know that Lord Voldemort was once called Tom Riddle. I taught him myself, fifty years ago, at Hogwarts. He disappeared after leaving the school ... traveled far and wide ... sank so deeply into the Dark Arts, consorted with the very worst of our kind, underwent so many dangerous, magical transformations, that when he resurfaced as Lord Voldemort, he was barely recognizable. Hardly anyone connected Lord Voldemort with the clever, handsome boy who was once Head Boy here.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But, Ginny,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"What's our Ginny got to do with - with -- him?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"His d-diaryl\" Ginny sobbed. \"I've b-been writing in it, and he's been w-writing back all year --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"tinny!\" said Mr. Weasley, flabbergasted. \"Haven't I taught you anything. What have I always told you? Never trust anything that can think for itself if you can't see where it keeps its brain? Why didn't you show the diary to me, or your mother? A suspicious object like that, it was clearly full of Dark Magic ='\n\u3000\u3000*329*\n\u3000\u3000\"I d-didn't know,\" sobbed Ginny. \"I found it inside one of the books Mum got me. I th-thought someone had just left it in there and forgotten about it --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Miss Weasley should go up to the hospital wing right away,\" Dumbledore interrupted in a firm voice. \"This has been a terrible ordeal for her. There will be no punishment. Older and wiser wizards than she have been hoodwinked by Lord Voldemort.\" He strode over to the door and opened it. \"Bed rest and perhaps a large, steaming mug of hot chocolate. I always find that cheers me up,\" he added, twinkling kindly down at her. \"You will find that Madam Pomfrey is still awake. She's just giving out Mandrake juice -- I daresay the basilisk's victims will be waking up any moment.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"So Hermione's okay!\" said Ron brightly.\n\u3000\u3000\"There has been no lasting harm done, Ginny,\" said Dumbledore.\n\u3000\u3000Mrs. Weasley led Ginny out, and Mr. Weasley followed, still looking deeply shaken.\n\u3000\u3000\"You know, Minerva,\" Professor Dumbledore said thoughtfully to Professor McGonagall, \"I think all this merits a good feast. Might I ask you to go and alert the kitchens?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Right,\" said Professor McGonagall crisply, also moving to the door. \"I'll leave you to deal with Potter and Weasley, shall I?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Certainly,\" said Dumbledore.\n\u3000\u3000She left, and Harry and Ron gazed uncertainly at Dumbledore. What exactly had Professor McGonagall meant, deal with them? Surely - surely - they weren't about to be punished?\n\u3000\u3000\"I seem to remember telling you both that I would have to expel you if you broke any more school rules, said Dumbledore.\n\u3000\u3000*%30*\n\u3000\u3000Ron opened his mouth in horror.\n\u3000\u3000\"Which goes to show that the best of us must sometimes eat our words,\" Dumbledore went on, smiling. \"You will both receive Special Awards for Services to the School and -- let me see - yes, I think two hundred points apiece for Gryffindor.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron went as briglitly pink as Lockhart's valentine flowers and closed his mouth again.\n\u3000\u3000\"But one of us seems to be keeping mightily quiet about his part in this dangerous adventure,\" Dumbledore added. \"Why so modest, Gilderoy?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry gave a start. He had completely forgotten about Lockhart. He turned and saw that Lockhart was standing in a corner of the room, still wearing his vague smile. When Dumbledore addressed him, Lockhart looked over his shoulder to see who he was talking to.\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor Dumbledore,\" Ron said quickly, \"there was an accident down in the Chamber of Secrets. Professor Lockhart --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Am I a professor?\" said Lockhart in mild surprise. \"Goodness. I expect I was hopeless, was I?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He tried to do a Memory Charm and the wand backfired,\" Ron explained quietly to Dumbledore.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dear me,\" said Dumbledore, shaking his head, his long silver mustache quivering. \"Impaled upon your own sword, Gilderoy!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Sword?\" said Lockhart dimly. \"Haven't got a sword. That boy has, though.\" He pointed at Harry. \"He'll lend you one.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Would you mind taking Professor Lockhart up to the infirmary, too?\" Dumbledore said to Ron. \"Id like a few more words with Harry .....\n\u3000\u3000Lockhart ambled out. Ron cast a curious look back at Dumbledore and Harry as he closed the door.\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore crossed to one of the chairs by the fire.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sit down, Harry,\" he said, and Harry sat, feeling unaccountably nervous.\n\u3000\u3000\"First of all, Harry, I want to thank you,\" said Dumbledore, eyes twinkling again. \"You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you.\"\n\u3000\u3000He stroked the phoenix, which had fluttered down onto his knee. Harry grinned awkwardly as Dumbledore watched him.\n\u3000\u3000\"And so you met Tom Riddle,\" said Dumbledore thoughtfully. \"I imagine he was most interested in you . . . . \"\n\u3000\u3000Suddenly, something that was nagging at Harry came tumbling out of his mouth.\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor Dumbledore ... Riddle said I'm like him. Strange likenesses, he said ......\n\u3000\u3000\"Did he, now?\" said Dumbledore, looking thoughtfully at Harry from under his thick silver eyebrows. \"And what do you think, Harry?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't think I'm like him!\" said Harry, more loudly than he'd intended. \"I mean, I'm -- I'm in Gryffindor, I'm . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000But he fell silent, a lurking doubt resurfacing in his mind.\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor,\" he started again after a moment. \"The Sorting Hat told me Id -- Id have done well in Slytherin. Everyone thought I was Slytherin's heir for a while ... because I can speak Parseltongue ....\n\u3000\u3000\"You can speak Parseltongue, Harry,\" said Dumbledore calmly, \"because Lord Voldemort -- who is the last remaining ancestor\n\u3000\u3000*$32*\n\u3000\u3000of Salazar Slytherin -- can speak Parseltongue. Unless I'm much mistaken, he transferred some of his own powers to you the night he gave you that scar. Not something he intended to do, I'm sure ....\n\u3000\u3000\"Voldemort put a bit of himself in me?\" Harry said, thunderstruck.\n\u3000\u3000\"It certainly seems so.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"So I should be in Slytherin,\" Harry said, looking desperately into Dumbledore's face. \"The Sorting Hat could see Slytherin's power in me, and it --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Put you in Gryffindor,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"Listen to me, Harry. You happen to have many qualities Salazar Slytherin prized in his hand- picked students. His own very rare gift, Parseltongue - resourcefulness - determination -- a certain disregard for rules,\" he added, his mustache quivering again. \"Yet the Sorting Hat placed you in Gryffindor. You know why that was. Think.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It only put me in Gryffindor,\" said Harry in a defeated voice, \"because I asked not to go in Slytherin . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000`Exactly, \"said Dumbledore, beaming once more. \"Which makes you very different from Tom Riddle. It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.\" Harry sat motionless in his chair, stunned. \"If you want proof, Harry, that you belong in Gryffindor, I suggest you look more closely at this.\"\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore reached across to Professor McGonagall's desk, picked up the blood-stained silver sword, and handed it to Harry. Dully, Harry turned it over, the rubies blazing in the firelight. And then he saw the name engraved just below the hilt.\n\u3000\u3000Godric Gryffindor\n\u3000\u3000*333*\n\u3000\u3000\"Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat, Harry,\" said Dumbledore simply.\n\u3000\u3000For a minute, neither of them spoke. Then Dumbledore pulled open one of the drawers in Professor McGonagall's desk and took out a quill and a bottle of ink.\n\u3000\u3000What you need, Harry, is some food and sleep. I suggest you go down to the feast, while I write to Azkaban -- we need our gamekeeper back. And I must draft an advertisement for the Daily Prophet, too,\" he added thoughtfully. \"We'll be needing a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher... Dear me, we do seem to run through them, don't we?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry got up and crossed to the door. He had just reached for the handle, however, when the door burst open so violently that it bounced back off the wall.\n\u3000\u3000Lucius Malfoy stood there, fury in his face. And cowering behind his legs, heavily wrapped in bandages, was Dobby.\n\u3000\u3000\"Good evening, Lucius,\" said Dumbledore pleasantly.\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Malfoy almost knocked Harry over as he swept into the room. Dobby went scurrying in after him, crouching at the hem of his cloak, a look of abject terror on his face.\n\u3000\u3000The elf was carrying a stained rag with which he was attempting to finish cleaning Mr. Malfoys shoes. Apparently Mr. Malfoy had set out in a great hurry, for not only were his shoes half-polished, but his usually sleek hair was disheveled. Ignoring the elf bobbing apologetically around his ankles, he fixed his cold eyes upon Dumbledore.\n\u3000\u3000\"So!\" he said \"You've come back. The governors suspended you, but you still saw fit to return to Hogwarts.\"\n\u3000\u3000*%$4*\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, you see, Lucius,\" said Dumbledore, smiling serenely, \"the other eleven governors contacted me today. It was something like being caught in a hailstorm of owls, to tell the truth. They'd heard that Arthur Weasleys daughter had been killed and wanted me back here at once. They seemed to think I was the best man for the job after all. Very strange tales they told me, too .... Several of them seemed to think that you had threatened to curse their families if they didn't agree to suspend me in the first place.\"\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Malfoy went even paler than usual, but his eyes were still slits of fury.\n\u3000\u3000\"So -- have you stopped the attacks yet?\" he sneered. \"Have you caught the culprit?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We have,\" said Dumbledore, with a smile.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well?\"said Mr. Malfoy sharply. \"Who is it?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"The same person as last time, Lucius,\" said Dumbledore. \"But this time, Lord Voldemort was acting through somebody else. By means of this diary.\"\n\u3000\u3000He held up the small black book with the large hole through the center, watching Mr. Malfoy closely. Harry, however, was watching Dobby.\n\u3000\u3000The elf was doing something very odd. His great eyes fixed meaningfully on Harry, he kept pointing at the diary, then at Mr. Malfoy, and then hitting himself hard on the head with his fist.\n\u3000\u3000\"I see. . . \" said Mr. Malfoy slowly to Dumbledore.\n\u3000\u3000\"A clever plan,\" said Dumbledore in a level voice, still staring Mr. Malfoy straight in the eye. \"Because if Harry here\" --Mr. Malfoy shot Harry a swift, sharp look -- \"and his friend Ron hadn't discovered this book, why -- Ginny Weasley might have taken all\n\u3000\u3000*335*\n\u3000\u3000the blame. No one would ever have been able to prove she hadn't acted of her own free will ......\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Malfoy said nothing. His face was suddenly masklike.\n\u3000\u3000\"And imagine,\" Dumbledore went on, \"what might have happened then .... The Weasleys are one of our most prominent pure-blood families. Imagine the effect on Arthur Weasley and his Muggle Protection Act, if his own daughter was discovered attacking and - killing Muggle-borns .... Very fortunate the diary was discovered, and Riddle's memories wiped from it. \"Who knows what the consequences might have been otherwise ......\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Malfoy forced himself to speak.\n\u3000\u3000\"Very fortunate,\" he said stiffly.\n\u3000\u3000And still, behind his back, Dobby was pointing, first to the diary, then to Lucius Malfoy, then punching himself in the head.\n\u3000\u3000And Harry suddenly understood. He nodded at Dobby, and Dobby backed into a corner, now twisting his ears in punishment.\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't you want to know how Ginny got hold of that diary, Mr. Malfoy?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000Lucius Malfoy rounded on him.\n\u3000\u3000\"How should I know how the stupid little girl got hold of it?\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000\"Because you gave it to her,\" said Harry. \"In Flourish and Blotts. You picked up her old Transfiguration book and slipped the diary inside it, didn't you?\"\n\u3000\u3000He saw Mr. Malfoy's white hands clench and unclench.\n\u3000\u3000\"Prove it,\" he hissed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, no one will be able to do that,\" said Dumbledore, smiling at Harry. \"Not now that Riddle has vanished from the book. On\n\u3000\u3000*336*\n\u3000\u3000the other hand, I would advise you, Lucius, not to go giving out any more of Lord Voldemort's old school things. If any more of them find their way into innocent hands, I think Arthur Weasley, for one, will make sure they are traced back to you ......\n\u3000\u3000Lucius Malfoy stood for a moment, and Harry distinctly saw his right hand twitch as though he was longing to reach for his wand. Instead, he turned to his house-elf\n\u3000\u3000\"We're going, Dobby!\"\n\u3000\u3000He wrenched open the door and as the elf came hurrying up to him, he kicked him right through it. They could hear Dobby squealing with pain all the way along the corridor. Harry stood for a moment, thinking hard. Then it came to him -\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor Dumbledore,\" he said hurriedly. \"Can I give that diary back to Mr. Malfoy, please?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Certainly, Harry,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"But hurry. The feast, remember ......\n\u3000\u3000Harry grabbed the diary and dashed out of the office. He could hear Dobby's squeals of pain receding around the corner. Quickly, wondering if this plan could possibly work, Harry took off one of his shoes, pulled off his slimy, filthy sock, and stuffed the diary into it. Then he ran down the dark corridor.\n\u3000\u3000He caught up with them at the top of the stairs.\n\u3000\u3000\"Mr. Malfoy,\" he gasped, skidding to a halt, \"I've got something for you --\"\n\u3000\u3000And he forced the smelly sock into Lucius Malfoy's hand.\n\u3000\u3000\")What the --?\"\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Malfoy ripped the sock off the diary, threw it aside, then looked furiously from the ruined book to Harry.\n\u3000\u3000*',531*\n\u3000\u3000You'll meet the same sticky end as your parents one of these days, Harry Potter,\" he said softly. \"They were meddlesome fools, too.\n\u3000\u3000He turned to go.\n\u3000\u3000\"Come, Dobby. I said, come.\"\n\u3000\u3000But Dobby didn't move. He was holding up Harry's disgusting, slimy sock, and looking at it as though it were a priceless treasure.\n\u3000\u3000\"Master has given a sock,\" said the elf in wonderment. \"Master gave it to Dobby.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What's that?\" spat Mr. Malfoy. \"What did you say?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Got a sock,\" said Dobby in disbelief. \"Master threw it, and Dobby caught it, and Dobby -- Dobby is free. \"\n\u3000\u3000Lucius Malfoy stood frozen, staring at the elf Then he lunged at Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"You've lost me my servant, boy!\"\n\u3000\u3000But Dobby shouted, \"You shall not harm Harry Potter!\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a loud bang, and Mr. Malfoy was thrown backward. He crashed down the stairs, three at a time, landing in a crumpled heap on the landing below. He got up, his face livid, and pulled out his wand, but Dobby raised a long, threatening finger.\n\u3000\u3000\"You shall go now,\" he said fiercely, pointing down at Mr. Malfoy. \"You shall not touch Harry Potter. You shall go now.\"\n\u3000\u3000Lucius Malfoy had no choice. With a last, incensed stare at the pair of them, he swung his cloak around him and hurried out of sight.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry Potter freed Dobby!\" said the elf shrilly, gazing up at Harry, moonlight from the nearest window reflected in his orb-like eyes. \"Harry Potter set Dobby free!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Least I could do, Dobby,\" said Harry, grinning. \"Just promise never to try and save my life again.\"\n\u3000\u3000The elf's ugly brown face split suddenly into a wide, toothy smile.\n\u3000\u3000\"I've just got one question, Dobby,\" said Harry as Dobby pulled on Harry's sock with shaking hands. \"You told me all this had nothing to do with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, remember? Well --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It was a clue, sir,\" said Dobby, his eyes widening, as though this was obvious. \"Was giving you a clue. The Dark Lord, before he changed his name, could be freely named, you see?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Right,\" said Harry weakly. \"Well, Id better go. There's a feast, and my friend Hermione should be awake by now .....\n\u3000\u3000Dobby threw his arms around Harry's middle and hugged him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry Potter is greater by far than Dobby knew!\" he sobbed. \"Farewell, Harry Potter!\"\n\u3000\u3000And with a final loud crack, Dobby disappeared.\n\u3000\u3000Harry had been to several Hogwarts feasts, but never one quite like this. Everybody was in their pajamas, and the celebration lasted all night. Harry didn't know whether the best bit was Hermione running toward him, screaming \"You solved it! You solved it!\" or Justin hurrying over from the Hufflepuff table to wring. his hand and apologize endlessly for suspecting him, or Hagrid turning up at half past three, cuffing Harry and Ron so hard on the shoulders that they were knocked into their plates of trifle, or his and Ron's four hundred points for Gryffindor securing the House Cup for the second year running, or Professor McGonagall standing up to\n\u3000\u3000tell them all that the exams had been canceled as a school treat (\"Oh, no!\" said Hermione), or Dumbledore announcing that, unfortunately, Professor Lockhart would be unable to return next year, owing to the fact that he needed to go away and get his memory back. Quite a few of the teachers joined in the cheering that greeted this news.\n\u3000\u3000\"Shame,\" said Ron, helping himself to a jam doughnut. \"He was starting to grow on me.\"\n\u3000\u3000The rest of the final term passed in a haze of blazing sunshine. Hogwarts was back to normal with only a few, small differences - Defense Against the Dark Arts classes were canceled (\"but we've had plenty of practice at that anyway,\" Ron told a disgruntled Hermione) and Lucius Malfoy had been sacked as a school governor. Draco was no longer strutting around the school as though he owned the place. On the contrary, he looked resentful and sulky. On the other hand, Ginny Weasley was perfectly happy again.\n\u3000\u3000Too soon, it was time for the journey home on the Hogwarts Express. Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny got a compartment to themselves. They made the most of the last few hours in which they were allowed to do magic before the holidays. They played Exploding Snap, set off the very last of Fred and George's Filibuster fireworks, and practiced disarming each other by magic. Harry was getting very good at it.\n\u3000\u3000They were almost at King's Cross when Harry remembered something.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ginny - what did you see Percy doing, that he didn't want you to tell anyone?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, that,\" said Ginny, giggling. \"Well - Percy's got a girlfriend.\" Fred dropped a stack of books on George's head.\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It's that Ravenclaw prefect, Penelope Clearwater,\" said Ginny. \"That's who he was writing to all last summer. He's been meeting her all over the school in secret. I walked in on them kissing in an empty classroom one day. He was so upset when she was -- you know - attacked. You won't tease him, will you?\" she added anxiously.\n\u3000\u3000\"Wouldn't dream of it,\" said Fred, who was looking like his birthday had come early.\n\u3000\u3000\"Definitely not,\" said George, sniggering.\n\u3000\u3000The Hogwarts Express slowed and finally stopped.\n\u3000\u3000Harry pulled out his quill and a bit of parchment and turned to Ron and Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"This is called a telephone number,\" he told Ron, scribbling it twice, tearing the parchment in two, and handing it to them. \"I told your dad how to use a telephone last summer - he'll know. Call me at the Dursleys', okay? I can't stand another two months with only Dudley to talk to ......\n\u3000\u3000\"Your aunt and uncle will be proud, though, won't they?\" said Hermione as they got off the train and joined the crowd thronging toward the enchanted barrier. \"When they hear what you did this year?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Proud?\" said Harry. \"Are you crazy? All those times I could've died, and I didn't manage it? They'll be furious ......\n\u3000\u3000And together they walked back through the gateway to the Muggle world. '\n"]
